The 765T features all the standard features that made the nuvi series so popular and then adds even more.","The large 4.3 inch LCD screen is surrounded by a black bezel. The left side of the unit has a slot for inserting an SD card. The speaker is located on the back of the unit. The unit measures 4.8”W x 3.0”H x .8”D and weighs a scant 6.2 ounces.","<strong>Standout Features</strong>","•\tLane Assist<br/>•\tHands-free Calling<br/>•\tBuilt in Media Player<br/>•\t4.3 Inch Display","<strong>Features</strong>","We have had some time now to get acquainted with the Garmin nuvi 765T and we are a little sad to actually have to send it back. The nuvi 765T performed above our expectations and was surprisingly easy to use.","While it is difficult to gauge how well the device performs while using it in a city with which we are familiar, it was easy to see the benefits of the many features if you had to rely on it. The 765T knew when to change lanes. We found that even driving the same route everyday, we sometimes forget to move over into the right lane in time. The 765T reminded us time and time again when we needed to change lanes to make the exit. If anything, this feature will make sure that you are not “that guy”, the one who realizes at the last minute that this is the right exit and cuts everyone off to make it. This feature is especially nice when the exit isn’t from the right hand lane. It will make sure you know to get into the far left lane, or the second from left to make your exit.","The Garmin nuvi 765T will actually speak street names. Instead of simply saying turn left in 200 feet, it will tell you to turn left on Maple Street. This is a nice feature since most of us have a hard time judging distance in a car traveling 50 Mph. The 765T also knows what the speed limit is for most roads and will display it on the screen. You can also have it display your estimated time of arrival and/or your trip distance as well.","The hands-free calling and built in media player are really what set this portable navigator apart from its competition. The 765T has a secure digital card slot on the side. All that’s required is loading up an SD card with your favorite tunes and the 765T can send those tunes to your car’s stereo via its headphone jack, or through its built in FM transmitter. The 765T lets you set the frequency to any FM station, so it’s easy to find one that won’t have too much interference.","With its built in Bluetooth technology, sending and receiving calls is also simple. The nuvi 765T connects to your Bluetooth enabled phone. It was easy to receive calls while on the road. The 765T displayed the incoming call with the caller ID from the phone. The sound wasn’t very loud using just the internal speaker however once the unit was connected to the car’s stereo it was much easier to hear the caller. We noticed the sound from the phone only came from the right speaker in the car. We suspect this is to help eliminate feedback from the speaker. Once the call was complete, the nuvi then resumed playing our music automatically.","The 4.3 inch display was easy to see, even in sunlight. The LCD screen has a matte finish which helps to reduce glare that you would get while using it outdoors. The touch screen interface was easy to use, although typing in street addresses was a little finicky as it seems the unit wanted us to touch just above the button we intended to press.","On other GPS units that we have reviewed, we found that many have trouble with Salt Lake City’s street grid system. That is, it is difficult for the user to manually enter a street address that the GPS unit recognizes. The nuvi 765T had no trouble finding and recognizing streets.","<strong>Summary of Reviews</strong>","The expert reviewers liked the feature set of the nuvi 765T. The touch screen interface was easy to see and a breeze to use. The Bluetooth interface seemed to be a little problematic in that it sometimes had trouble keeping a connection with the phone. We here at TopTenREVIEWS noticed that the mount that attaches the unit to your windshield would fall off periodically. Overall the Garmin nuvi 765T gets a solid recommendation for anyone looking for a portable navigation device with above average features.","The users liked the wide, large 4.3 inch LCD display. The unit also comes with free traffic alerts for life which can help you select the best route home. The 765T was also able to lock onto satellites quickly and finding points of interest was also quick.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Garmin nuvi 765T is a great choice for anyone looking for a GPS that does more than just tell you where you’re going and how to get there. With its advanced feature set and easy to use interface, the Garmin nuvi 765T knows how to get you there with style.<br/>","<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2lvRVy5MNk&amp;feature=channel_page\">Click here for a hands on video review of the Garmin Nuvi 765T</a>"]},"id":"173e9c1f-36c1-4ef7-bdf6-319ac13c5286","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_27475","url":"/garmin-nuvi-765t-24255-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-02-04T07:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-02-04T07:00:00Z","name":"Garmin Nuvi 765T Nuvi 765T","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":79,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-02-16T20:04:07Z","id":"5neZAHzb4R4m2u8Q9NLcM4","meta":{"title":"Garmin Nuvi 765T Nuvi 765T Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Check out the features that the Garmin Nuvi 765T offers."},"products":[{"slug":"garmin-nuvi-765t-nuvi-765t","url":"/product/garmin-nuvi-765t-nuvi-765t","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:15:22Z","name":"Garmin Nuvi 765T Nuvi 765T","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:15:22Z","id":"mUaCyBybFCtEv6SxuYB5ZW","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:15:22Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/iiLu4awiaJZJGKLvS5PwJ6.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:15:22Z","mimeType":"","name":"ce24255.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/ce24255.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:15:22Z","id":"iiLu4awiaJZJGKLvS5PwJ6","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iiLu4awiaJZJGKLvS5PwJ6.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Garmin Nuvi 765T Nuvi 765T Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Check out the features that the Garmin Nuvi 765T offers."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/iiLu4awiaJZJGKLvS5PwJ6.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:15:22Z","mimeType":"","name":"ce24255.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/ce24255.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:15:22Z","id":"iiLu4awiaJZJGKLvS5PwJ6","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iiLu4awiaJZJGKLvS5PwJ6.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Garmin Nuvi 765T Nuvi 765T Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Check out the features that the Garmin Nuvi 765T offers."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/gps/best-navigation-gps/garmin-nuvi-765t-24255-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:15:22Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:15:22Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gps","url":"/electronics/gps","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:15:22Z","name":"GPS","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:15:22Z","id":"PaNWioUkFhvsXZKxXS5PLR","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
