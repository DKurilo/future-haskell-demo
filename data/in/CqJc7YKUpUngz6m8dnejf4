Incorporating a Blu-ray player into the AV receiver is one of the main features we looked for when created our side-by-side comparison chart. The reason it&#39;s so important is that it&#39;s the only way to guarantee optimization between the player and all the unit&#39;s various setting and speakers. Home-theaters systems that require you to route your picture through a third-party player add several layers of steps and frustration that stem from connecting a player to an AV receiver.","The Blu-ray tray on the Samsung Smart Home Theater HT-D6730W also plays DVDs. However, those discs don&#39;t contain HD video. Therefore, by themselves, they are incapable of utilizing all the pixels available on an HD television or monitor. This home theater system employs 1080p upconversion technology to remedy this problem. This feature transforms standard-definition images found on DVDs and other media and scales them to fit on an HD screen. This doesn&#39;t actually make the pictures HD, but the pictures still look great.","Further on the video front is the Samsung Smart Home Theater HT-D6730W&#39;s ability to display 3D video and images. This home theater provides 3D active-shutter glasses. Theaters running 3D movies use these same glasses. Therefore, you can watch movies like &#34;Avatar&#34; in all their 3D glory.","Of all the sources the Samsung Smart Home Theater HT-D6730W draws video from, the most forward thinking is the home theater&#39;s internet-streaming options. We are quickly moving into a world where silver discs are dying and content is migrating to the cloud. This home theater has a number of options integrated into its user interface that allow you to stream movies, videos and TV shows from whatever device your AV receiver is connected to.","Speaking of the user interface, the GUI provided by the Samsung Smart Home Theater HT-D6730W is among the most intuitive and accessible of all the home theater in a box systems on our side-by-side comparison chart.
