The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-home-automation-systems\">Home Automation Systems</a> here.</em>","Wink, the newest home automation system in our review, is the brainchild of Quirky, an online invention platform. The system is compatible with many devices and is easy to use. However, this smart home system does not have many of the advanced features that you usually find in the best home automation systems.","The Wink Hub is the central hardware controller for this intelligent home system. The hub connects exclusively to Android and iOS mobile devices using a Wi-Fi signal or Bluetooth connection. However, since this system is still relatively new, some Wink hubs have a flaw that prevents the Wi-Fi from working properly, which can make it difficult to setup and use the hub. If you get a hub without this flaw, the setup process only takes a few minutes.","Wink also sells an alternative hardware controller: Wink Relay. The Wink Relay is a premium touchscreen that allows you to control your Wink smart house system without a smartphone, unlike the Wink Hub. Similarly, Wink Relay is one of the few home automation controllers in our lineup with a touchscreen. Wink Relay also doubles as a replacement for standard light switches and has a built-in intercom that Wink plans to activate in a future software update.","After you finish initial setup of your Wink hub or Wink Relay, the Wink mobile app is intuitive and easy to use. It compares well with mobile apps of the best home automation systems. As long as you have the appropriate peripherals, the app allows you to create schedules, dim your lighting and create robots. Robots are simple programs that perform simple tasks when the systems detect a particular stimulus. For example, you can create a robot that tells Wink to flash the lights in your home when a smoke detector goes off. The Wink app also allows you to create shortcuts, which can help you turn on the lights with a single tap. Wink doesn&#39;t support voice control, randomized programs or wired systems.","The Wink smart home system is compatible with Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, ZigBee and Bluetooth home control technologies. Wink does not support legacy automation protocols or home theater equipment. You can add most types of smart home tech to your smart home, usually generic Z-Wave units but also products from Nest, Lutron and other smart home companies.","The Wink installation process is entirely DIY. You can contact customer support via email and telephone if you have a problem with your system. You can also browse Wink&#39;s FAQs or user manuals on the company&#39;s website. Wink does not have an online forum or live-chat support, both of which are often more convenient than traditional contact methods."]},"id":"9063bc95-f0a1-40d7-923a-586fbbdeb221","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7301ab4e-3e0b-4be7-b403-a0f4a4e98ff7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Of all of the smart home systems in our review, Wink has the most potential.
