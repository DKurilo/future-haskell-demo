CS5119 is average for a basic <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">cordless phone</a>. It has standard features like handset location, handset-to-handset intercom, a 50-entry phone book directory, quiet mode and a compact design.","This model looks very similar to the <a href=\"/vtech-review\">VTech CS6719</a>, though we didn’t like the CS5119 as much. Both phones are the same price and share many of the same settings and functions, but their design differences make the CS6719 the better option. The CS5119’s handset is blocky with hard edges, which makes it uncomfortable to hold and use.","In our tests, the VTech CS5119 took less time to charge to full battery than over half the other phones we tested. However, it also died faster in our standby battery test than most of the others.","The CS5119’s base is small and doesn’t take up much room. It features a single button and a light that turns on when a handset is in use. The location button pages the handset, which rings so you can find it. This cordless phone doesn’t have an answering machine or backup power function, but you can expand the system to five handsets on one phone line.","The VTech CS5119 has a call-blocking feature, which isn’t common on basic phones. If you pay for caller ID service through your phone company, you can program the phone to block up to 20 numbers. This is a neat feature, but 20 phone numbers isn’t very many considering the prevalence of telemarketers. Other phones we tested with similar call-blocking features, including the <a href=\"/panasonic-review\">Panasonic XK-TGE433B</a>, can block up to 250 numbers.","This  VTech phone’s phone book holds up to 50 name and number entries. It also keeps a record of the 10 numbers you dialed most recently and the 30 most recent caller ID entries. For comparison, the better VTech CS6719 phone keeps a record of 50 caller ID entries, though it doesn’t have the 20-number call-blocking feature.","There are seven volume levels, including off. In addition, you can choose from 10 ring tones, though you can’t assign individual rings to each contacts.","The VTech CS5119 is a decent cordless home phone. It does everything a phone needs to do, and it includes all the standard features that make calling easier. It’s a good budget buy, but we prefer other phones we tested over this one."]},"id":"970e9b55-e566-429f-bfa0-f84fdedb1750","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50708","url":"/vtech-cs-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-09-14T15:41:04Z","datePublished":"2010-09-14T15:41:04Z","name":"VTech CS5119","synopsis":"The VTech CS5119 is average for a basic cordless phone.
