The scanner processes documents at an excellent rate of 30 pages per minute. In addition, it scans the first 10 pages of any document batch at an increased 40 pages per minute. Overall, the Kodak has faster specifications than many of the other <a href=\"/best-document-scanners\">document scanners</a> we reviewed, which makes it a strong fit for small or large offices.","This machine can also automatically recognize text and scan it to a searchable PDF file format. You can set the scanner to detect other data as well, such as financial information and barcodes, and export them to appropriate applications or previously specified programs. In addition, you can scan documents as TIFFs, JPEGs, RTFs, BMPs and regular PDFs. During the scan process, the ScanMate removes blank pages and straightens crooked scans.","The Kodak ScanMate i1150 has a slot for plastic credit cards and laminated licenses that makes scanning these smaller, non-paper items convenient, and the paper tray holds up to 75 sheets of paper. While the power cord comes out of the back on the left-hand side, channels allow it to be tucked inside and exit on the right when that’s more conducive to your setup, which is also convenient.","Unlike the <a href=\"/brother-imagecenter-review\">Brother ImageCenter</a>, The Kodak doesn’t have export support for mobile devices, but you can send your scanned documents to applications or storage systems in the cloud. This serves as a backup that protects your vital information from local disasters. It also makes it easy to access your information from a laptop on the road when you travel.","To protect your investment, Kodak includes a one-year warranty on ScanMate i1150. In addition, support services are excellent, with clearly marked driver and software downloads, FAQs and support links on the product site."]},"id":"0782b1d2-153f-45eb-b62c-a49f3ec3cccb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"181d32bf-c7e9-448d-b4a8-e1ef6736a0a5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For smaller scanning projects, the Kodak ScanMate i1150 is by far the fastest unit we reviewed.
