The discount rate is the percentage of each transaction and the per-transaction fee is a flat fee you pay each time someone pays with a credit card, regardless of how much the purchase cost.","In order to understand the various pricing models and which rates are negotiable, you need to know what is included in the rates. Both the discount rate and per-transaction fee are comprised of the following costs and markup:","<strong>Interchange Rate</strong><br/>This rate varies depending on which type of card your customer uses. It accounts for the bulk of the discount rate and is paid to the issuing bank. It&#39;s a non-negotiable cost set by the card brands, and every processor pays the same amounts for this part of the transaction cost. The card brands publish the rate tables on their websites.","<strong>Assessment Fees</strong><br/>These are additional non-negotiable costs set by the card brands, and again, every processor pays the same amount. This rate varies depending on the brand of card your customer uses, such as MasterCard or Visa, and is paid to that card brand. Assessment fees may also include MasterCard&#39;s Network Access and Brand Usage (NABU), Visa&#39;s Network Acquirer Processing Fee (APF) and Discover&#39;s Data Usage fee.","<strong>Processor&#39;s Markup</strong><br/>This is the only negotiable portion of the discount rate. Instead of being set by the card brands, it&#39;s set by the credit card processing company.","<strong>What&#39;s the Best Credit Card Processing Pricing Model?</strong>","Most credit card processing companies offer one or more of the three main pricing models to calculate the transaction rates that you pay: interchange-plus, flat-rate and tiered pricing. The best pricing model for your company depends on the volume of cards you process each month, the average ticket size of your transactions and which type of cards you accept most."]},"id":"ac15c7bc-22a9-46e6-a23b-ff7462dd75ad","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/XSqTmffrtTgzrKLy8KPgqY.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/10378/credit-card-pro-3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XSqTmffrtTgzrKLy8KPgqY.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"XSqTmffrtTgzrKLy8KPgqY","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XSqTmffrtTgzrKLy8KPgqY.jpg","alt":""},"id":"84547b3c-6c53-419f-a705-036083eef803","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Even though this pricing model is offered by most credit card processing companies, and the best processors offer it to all of their customers, you may have to specifically ask for it when you&#39;re calling for quotes as many companies prefer to set you up with tiered pricing.

Here&#39;s more information on the types of cards and verification methods commonly included in these tiers:","<em><strong>Qualified</strong></em><br/>A transaction is qualified if the customer swipes or dips the card and either signs or enters a PIN to authorize the transaction. Most often, this is a regular credit or debit card with no rewards attached to it.","<em><strong>Mid-Qualified</strong></em><br/>If you manually key in a transaction and use an address verification service (AVS) to verify the address of the cardholder, it may be considered mid-qualified. This tier may also include <a href=\"/best-rewards-credit-cards\">rewards credit or debit cards</a>, although some processors categorize rewards cards as non-qualified transactions, particularly those with premium rewards.","<em><strong>Non-Qualified </strong></em><br/>Transactions that you manually key in without using an AVS service are considered non-qualified, as are transactions made using international, corporate and government-issued credit and debit cards. Additionally, some processors categorize rewards credit and debit cards as non-qualified transactions, especially premium rewards cards.","Qualified rates are temptingly low, particularly for debit cards, and if your business accepts a high percentage of regular debit cards, this type of pricing model can be a good choice for your business. However, if your clientele tends to use high-end rewards credit cards or if you key in a lot of sales, such as for phoned-in orders, you may find yourself paying expensive non-qualified rates. For this reason, it&#39;s important to understand what kind of cards your customers use and how your processor categorizes them.","<strong>What Credit Card Processing Fees I Should Expect?</strong>"]},"id":"c29fba17-485a-4884-a77e-a017d09fa0ec","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/7uiJpCE4fk4NbpBcbUFukQ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"In addition to the processing rates you pay for each sales transaction, most companies charge fees for account maintenance.

Some processors include printed statements in this cost, others charge an additional fee if you opt to receive printed, mailed statements.","<strong>Gateway Fee</strong><br/>A payment gateway is the online equivalent of a credit card terminal. Processors may have their own proprietary system or may work with a third-party provider such as Authorize.net. If you sell your products online through your company&#39;s website, you require gateway access. Most companies charge a separate monthly fee for this service, though some include it in the monthly fee.","<strong>Monthly Minimum Fee</strong><br/>Many standard credit card processing companies expect you to process a certain amount of credit card transactions each month. Some companies use a monthly minimum to ensure your account stays active, and they apply the full dollar amount of your transactions to the monthly minimum. However, most processors use it to guarantee that they generate at least a certain dollar amount of transaction fees from your account each month, and apply only the processing costs to the monthly minimum.","What this means is that a standard $25 monthly minimum can be calculated very differently, and if your business is small or seasonal, it&#39;s important to inquire about the dollar amount you have to process in order to meet the minimum. If you fail to meet the monthly minimum, most credit card processors charge you the difference rather than the full fee, but in order to avoid surprises on your bill, it&#39;s best to ask your processor in advance about this fee.","<strong>PCI-Compliance Fee</strong><br/>The Payment Card Industry has data security regulations that all merchants must adhere to in order to process credit cards. These regulations help prevent fraud and protect you, your customers and the credit card company from costly security breaches.","In order to certify as compliant, you&#39;re required to complete a self-assessment questionnaire, though depending on your business, you may need to meet additional compliance requirements. Most traditional credit card processors that set you up with your own merchant account charge this fee to help you establish and maintain your compliance, however not all do. Most aggregators, or mobile credit card processing companies, don&#39;t charge PCI-related fees, but <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">take care of PCI compliance</a> on their end so that you don&#39;t have to worry about it.","This fee may be charged monthly, quarterly or annually. It isn&#39;t always disclosed when you call processors for quotes, so you want to ask how much it is, how often it&#39;s charged, and what services the processor provides to help you meet PCI compliance. For example, some companies provide breach insurance and security scans with this fee. However, you want to negotiate this fee since some companies are willing to waive it, particularly if you&#39;ve already certified as PCI compliant or if you handle PCI compliance in house.","<strong>PCI Non-Compliance Fee</strong><br/>When you sign up with a processor, you usually have a few months to establish PCI compliance. However, if you fail to comply or if you don&#39;t annually reestablish your compliance, you may incur a monthly fine. The amount of the fine varies by processor and can be quite expensive; for this reason, it&#39;s important to check your statements monthly for notices that your compliance renewal is coming due or to catch any new fees that pop up on your statement.","<strong>Batch Fee</strong><br/>This is a nominal fee charged whenever you post a batch of transactions, which is usually once or twice a day. It&#39;s normally the same amount as the per-transaction fee, which is usually between $0.10 and $0.25.","<strong>Address Verification Service (AVS) Fee</strong><br/>You&#39;re charged this fee when you use AVS to verify the billing address of the cardholder. AVS is a fraud-prevention tool frequently used with eCommerce credit card processing, but you may also use this service if you manually key in a card, because you&#39;re taking payment information over the phone or your terminal was unable to read it. This fee varies between processors but is typically lower if you use the automated touchtone service and more expensive if you require operator assistance.","<strong>Voice Authorization Fee</strong><br/>As a fraud-prevention measure, your terminal may instruct you to call the voice authorization center to provide the cardholder&#39;s bank with additional information before it authorizes a transaction. Although voice authorization is rarely required, you&#39;re charged for each occurrence. This fee varies by processor and may be charged as either a flat fee or a percentage of the transaction.","<strong>Retrieval Fee (Retrieval Request Fee)</strong><br/>If a customer questions a charge, his or her bank may ask for a copy of the sales draft so they can verify the authenticity of a purchase. This request may escalate to a chargeback, or may prevent one if the issuing bank or your customer is satisfied by the sales documentation you provide. This request may also be made if a customer needs a copy of a sales draft for his or her records or if purchase documentation is needed for legal proceedings such as bankruptcies or divorce settlements. The cost of this fee varies by processor.","<strong>Chargeback Fee</strong><br/>Every business aspires for 100 percent customer satisfaction, but there are times when customers want their money back and ask their bank to cancel the transaction and return the funds. When this happens, you pay a fee to cover the processing costs involved in crediting the customer&#39;s account with the amount of the purchase. Ecommerce businesses typically experience more chargebacks than companies that accept credit cards in person, since common reasons for chargebacks include delivery failures, technical errors, customer dissatisfaction and fraud. It can also happen if your merchant name differs from your store name and your customer doesn&#39;t recognize the charge on his or her credit card statement. The amount of this fee varies by processor.","<strong>Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) Fee</strong><br/>This may also be called a return draft fee. If you don&#39;t have enough money in your business bank account to pay the fees you owe your processing company, you are charged a fee.","<strong>Various Card Network Fees</strong><br/>In addition to the card brand assessment fees that are normally rolled into processing costs, the card networks charge a variety of non-negotiable fees, which are passed on to you through your processor. Be aware that some processors may overcharge you for network fees by adding a markup rather than passing them straight through to you. You should look on the credit card companies&#39; websites for the standard rates and compare them to the rates listed on your contract or charged on your statement.","<strong>APF/NABU/Data Usage Fees:</strong><br/>These are fees for using the card brands&#39; networks. Visa charges a Network Acquirer Processing Fee (APF), MasterCard charges a Network Access and Brand Usage (NABU) and Discover charges a Data Usage fee.","<strong>Visa&#39;s Fixed Acquirer Network Fee (FANF): </strong><br/>Since 2012, Visa has charged this non-negotiable, monthly fee in order to make up for revenue lost due to regulations implemented with the Durbin Amendment. It applies to all businesses that accept Visa-branded cards. The rate varies depending on your processing volume, the number of locations your business operates and how your business accepts payments. It&#39;s usually more expensive for businesses that process online than those that accept credit cards in person.","<strong>MasterCard&#39;s Merchant Location Fee</strong><br/>This is an annual fee that MasterCard implemented mid-2016 and increased to $15 per location for 2017. Your credit card processor may pass it on to you as a single annual fee or may prorate it on your monthly statement to spread out the cost.","<strong>Cross-Border Fees</strong><br/>If you&#39;re a U.S.-based merchant and accept an international card, the card networks charge a fee (or two) to offset currency exchange costs."]},"id":"5fc283d8-7bc2-4502-b056-166f5a981590","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["American Express charges an International Assessment fee.","Discover charges an International Processing Fee and an International Service Fee.","MasterCard charges a Cross-Border Assessment Fee and an Acquirer Program Support Fee."," Visa charges an International Acquirer Fee and an International Service Assessment Fee."],"type":"ul"},"id":"c2a8b8ed-b0d5-4667-adff-1f9e7a4f1901","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>What Credit Card Processing Fees Should I Avoid?</strong>"]},"id":"9ec9c3be-0d09-4b21-a930-1c975f9597ac","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/gBkFtG4B7EtUWpZbSEyQTk.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"In addition to the standard fees listed above, some processors charge a variety of miscellaneous fees.

You need to contact the processor to find out what you get for your membership; often, it&#39;s rolls of paper for your terminals. If you don&#39;t opt out or cancel your club membership, you&#39;re charged membership fees on a monthly or annual basis.","<strong>Additional Services</strong><br/>If your contract includes an &#34;Additional Services&#34; clause, the company automatically signs you up for various unnamed services (fees undisclosed), unless you opt out within a set timeframe, usually 30 days after you sign up with the company. You may be able to find information in the Program Guide about what the additional services are and what they cost, but you&#39;ll most likely have to contact your sales rep for this information.","<strong>Semi-Annual Postage &amp; Handling Fee</strong><br/>If you&#39;re already paying a statement fee or if you receive your statements and other correspondence electronically, ask to have this fee removed.","<strong>Access Fee</strong><br/>If you&#39;re charged an access fee in addition to APF/NABU/Data usage and FANF fees, you should call your processing company and ask what it is for and if it can be removed from your bill.","<strong>Foreign Handling Fee</strong><br/>Although the card networks charge non-negotiable fees if you accept foreign credit cards, some processors tack on a markup or a fee of their own. If you&#39;re charged more than two fees for a single foreign transaction, such as an International Acquirer Fee, International Service Access Fee and a Foreign Handling Fee, you should ask your credit card processor which fees are charged by the card network and which is their markup or surcharge, and if they can waive it for you.","<strong>Online Reporting (Online Transaction Reporting) Fee</strong><br/>This is a fee that may be charged if you opt for online rather than paper statements. The best processors don&#39;t charge this fee but provide online statements at no cost.","<strong>Monthly (or Quarterly) Regulatory Compliance Fee</strong><br/>This fee may replace, or be charged in addition to, the PCI compliance fee or the IRS reporting fee. This is a fee that you should question if you find it on your contract.","<strong>Other Nonstandard Fees</strong><br/>Below is a sampling of nonstandard fees to look for as you review a contract before signing up with a credit card processing company.
