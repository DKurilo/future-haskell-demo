User experience will determine if the visitors will stay and use the website or will navigate to another site that appeals to them.  As a result, this can have a direct impact on the site revenue.","No matter how appealing to the eyes a certain design may be, if it does not offer a user-friendly experience, it will not accomplish the objective of the site. The fact that there are countless number of duplicate sites to choose from, a user-friendly site will make visitors book-mark  your site and come back again; which is the essence of a website in the first place. Well-designed sites thus act as incentives for visitors to keep coming back.","What though is a user-friendly web site? A user-friendly web site has a number of considerations which includes the content, the site organization, the site navigation and the web site layout. A website that is well organized is easy in an intuitive manner.  Visitors to a site do not have the time or the patience to start learning how your web site operates. This means that your site should almost be instinctive to them. They should be able to locate what they want within seconds and be back to life as  they know it.","Since the internet has some of the most impatient clients, you have only a few seconds to impress your clients otherwise they will leave your site and, visit your competitorÂ s site, bookmark it. Not only do you lose a customer for life but there will never be any referrals to your site by that person. Whenever you are designing or organizing a site, you have to consider the content as well. Again, if visitors to your site will not find what they are looking for in terms of content within a few seconds, they will quickly move on to another. Organizing your content and buttons in an easy-to-read and easy-to-navigate way will help avoid this.","A professionally-designed site does not need to have a complicated design. In fact, the opposite is often true. You will be surprised at how a simple color scheme and layout works wonders when it comes to keeping visitors coming to your site again and again. The bottom line? Be as simple as possible and pay more attention to usability.","While a good look certainly plays a part in how your visitors will navigate while on the site, it is the usability that will keep them coming. Thus, ensure that all the links, images and pages are working and optimized to avoid errors during navigation. A well-designed site that has working links will even add credibility to your website. Flash is a powerful tool and the temptation to over-use it is all too common. Use flash animations to describe things that are difficult to describe in words.  By being simple, you make it easy for your visitors to locate what they need and this will show you respect and appreciate your clients."]},"id":"dcfd9f41-6941-4b23-9dc6-fd2cfd97d588","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_4780","url":"/user-friendly-web-design","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"davgit","url":"/author/davgit","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"davgit","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"zqehX9u6eQ4h93Nr8xL5XB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-17T06:02:41Z","datePublished":"2010-08-17T06:02:41Z","name":"User-Friendly Web Design","synopsis":"Since web design involves creating an interface that people will access to purchase, sell or gather information about certain resources or products, one of the requirements of a user-friendly web desi","review":{},"strapline":"Since web design involves creating an interface that people will access to purchase, sell or gather information about certain resources or products, one of the requirements of a user-friendly web desi","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-18T19:32:54Z","id":"kS8RTKineyhaY747y2R4em","meta":{"title":"User-Friendly Web Design","description":"User-friendly web design"},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:54:22Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/r9bEgkon9KQRZP5zPFc2h9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:54:22Z","mimeType":"","name":"4780-user-friendly-web-design.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/4780-user-friendly-web-design.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:54:22Z","id":"r9bEgkon9KQRZP5zPFc2h9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r9bEgkon9KQRZP5zPFc2h9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"User-Friendly Web Design","description":"User-friendly web design"},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/r9bEgkon9KQRZP5zPFc2h9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:54:22Z","mimeType":"","name":"4780-user-friendly-web-design.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/4780-user-friendly-web-design.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:54:22Z","id":"r9bEgkon9KQRZP5zPFc2h9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r9bEgkon9KQRZP5zPFc2h9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"User-Friendly Web Design","description":"User-friendly web design"}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/business/articles/user-friendly-web-design/","label":"","tags":[]}
