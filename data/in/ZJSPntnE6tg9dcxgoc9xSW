Social media customer service platforms offer a variety of features, including direct social integration and management. With ticket requests, FAQs and searchable databases, social media customer support services allow you to provide a range of offerings for your customers. Considering the following features can help you with choosing the right platform for your business.","<strong>Ticket Management</strong><br/>Ticket management allows you or your customers to create help-desk tickets from your social media via an extension or an integrated box. This allows you to track the progress of tickets in order to improve your social media CRM. Because you need a ticket for any problem that cannot be handled immediately, ticketing and ticket management is extremely important for any social media system.","<strong>Live Chat</strong><br/>Whether directly on your social platform, integrated from your social platform to your management app or as part of your social media customer service app, you need live chat. While you probably have live chat if you are on Facebook, some management apps allow you to integrate it so that you get notifications and can respond from one platform. This makes social media management simpler and allows you to respond more quickly, no matter where your social media customers are messaging you from.","<strong>Integration</strong><br/>Social media integration allows you to get notifications, respond and see alerts as soon as they happen. This is important if you want to manage all of your social media customer service from one app, even across multiple platforms. You also want to check which social platforms are compatible with the app based on your specific needs.","<strong>Analytics &amp; Insights</strong><br/>Analytics and insights allow you to track who is using your social media, what happens after contact, how quickly questions are responded to and what happens afterward. Analytics tools allow you valuable insights into your CRM, which allows you to improve the service. It also lets you track and improve your existing social platforms.","While social media customer service can include a lot of features, choosing the right ones for your business is essential for selecting the right customer service platform. Social media CRM improves your relationship with customers, allows you to provide cost-effective customer support and spreads your brand values faster than traditional marketing tools.","<strong>Conversocial Review</strong>"]},"id":"7c1d9e30-d99d-4750-aa45-c7bec545fb9b","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/wFXsWWxDxQeYoJzf7tcg6L.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Conversocial is cloud-based social customer service software for enterprise customers.

With its platform, your company can relate to its customers in real time and on social networks where your customers can always reach you. Conversocial offers three plans, and the one you should choose depends on your company&#39;s current implementation of social media CRM. These plans are Engage, Evolve and Extend.","At the core of Conversocial are its three key features: a priority response engine, a collaborative platform, and social media analytics and reporting. The priority response engine uses a self-learning algorithm to prioritize messages and conversations flowing through the central interface for all your social accounts. It uses natural language processing and historic data to determine which social events to push to the top of the pile.","Conversocial&#39;s collaborative platform is a team management tool that shares your customers&#39; social communication with your social media, marketing and customer care teams. The platform can also quantify your social media customer support activities by measuring customer satisfaction and the response time of your social customer service team.","Besides real-time tracking and reporting of social events, collaboration and intelligent prioritization, Conversocial also provides a single conversation thread for each customer so that your customer service officers can gain immediate access to all past interactions. In addition to a unified social CRM approach, Conversocial helps your company build knowledgebase communities for your social customers and customer service agents with its CROWDS app. Such communities lower the cost of providing customer support and encourages participation from your brand&#39;s customers.","Conversocial CROWDS is a mobile-friendly web app. However, its reach is restricted to Twitter. Therefore, your customer service agents cannot answer questions raised on other social media networks with this app. As a certified Twitter partner and a Facebook Strategic Marketing Developer, Conversocial integrates better with these two social media networks than with others. This is fine as long as Twitter and Facebook remain the leading social channels for your customers.","While Conversocial feeds social data to third-party CRM platforms, it remains separate from the rest of your customer service platform. Like most social media CRM tools, it charges its clients per user. Furthermore, it takes a minimum of two weeks for businesses to fully implement Conversocial, and it can take up to six weeks if you want to integrate it into your CRM platform.","Conversocial is a multi-feature social media customer support platform. Its social-first philosophy is especially appropriate for big customer-focused enterprises. However, without interface integration, implementing Conversocial into a traditional CRM platform takes time, staff retraining and lots of support.","<a href=\"#Back_to_Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong>Nimble Review</strong>"]},"id":"307cd823-3560-4234-8c70-79d7dc002211","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/rCDYi8KhwK83jHWpHMv9Je.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Nimble is a cloud-based social media CRM platform targeted at small and midsize businesses.

Nimble has the Personal Plan for individuals. While this plan shares most of the features of the Business Plan, it lacks multi-user support.","Nimble has a smart contact list manager that pulls information about your customers from multiple social networks without requiring you to enter any data. It can find where your customers live, work and go to school from social networks and social CRM platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, LinkedIn, Instagram, Foursquare, Swarm, Hootsuite, AngelList, CrunchBase and Salesforce. This is a pretty broad coverage of social channels even for a social media CRM tool.","Nimble also aggregates all your email and social media accounts in one unified inbox. You can send emails and social media messages from this inbox. The inbox also houses Nimble&#39;s smart contact manager. The rich contact list generated by this manager shows you all past and present communication with each client, as well as what everyone in your contact list is talking about on social networks.

It is available as a Chrome plugin, a Safari extension and a Firefox add-on. In addition, you can access it from Nimble&#39;s Android and iOS apps. However, these apps have limited functions.","Furthermore, importing and tagging your contacts in the unified inbox can be time-consuming, especially if you have a lot of them. While Nimble has social listening and insight capabilities, it is only trawling social networks for people already in your contact list, and it does not offer broad social analytics for trends related to your industry or brand.","Nimble is a simple social media CRM platform with lots of third-party support from leading CRM services and social media networks. Its standout feature is its unified inbox with its Smart Contacts app. However, is not an industry-facing social CRM tool, because it focuses on individual influencers rather than serving as a way to meet and respond to your many social customers.","<a href=\"#Back_to_Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong>Service Cloud by Salesforce Review</strong>"]},"id":"e8df316f-22da-4c40-9e9e-17d60370ad23","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/FiUxKVS5aTMn4T9M9cEULL.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Service Cloud is a cloud-based CRM platform from Salesforce.

To meet this goal, Service Cloud provides your customer care staff a central console that aggregates all of your customers&#39; information in one place. The cloud-based console also hosts a central knowledgebase that your staff and customers can contribute to. This creates an ever-expanding pool of information that you can access anywhere and from any device.","With Service Cloud, you can also take your social media customer service strategy further by solving customers&#39; issues in real time with on-screen guided assistance, screen sharing, and embedded video and audio communications with customer care agents. All of these customer support features can also be provisioned on your company&#39;s and Salesforce&#39;s mobile apps.","The social aspect of Service Cloud extends beyond its knowledge pool and the communities it helps build.

If your company has a dedicated social service team, integrating Service Cloud with Salesforce Social Studio directs all communications started on social networks to that team.","Thanks to the central console, your social media customer service team has all the information it needs about customers seeking help via social networks even before they respond.

However, it is not primarily a social CRM service. Social CRM is just one of its many features.

This tool allows you to create and publish promotions and microsites to gather social data. All of this is done with Shoutlet Canvas, a WYSIWYG editor that allows you to quickly build and run contests on your social media pages. However, while the Canvas tool is intuitive and simple to use, it is rudimentary for a content management system.","Although Shoutlet provides a central interface for all of your social media accounts, its use and integration of social data are largely at the mercy of the social media networks.
