However, it&#39;s multifunctional ability to warm your home while housing your belongings makes it a good pick. It is made of sturdy material and can hold a decent amount of weight. Since the fireplace is part of a piece of furniture, it is easier to hide this unit&#39;s cord than it is with most other electric fireplaces.","This <a href=\"/best-electric-fireplaces\">electric fireplace</a> has 4,600 Btu and best works to heat a room of 400 square feet or less. It typically draws on 1,400 watts to run. Unfortunately, this unit does not have automatic shutoff in case of overheating, so you should never leave it on unattended. It does stay cool to the touch, however. If you&#39;d prefer a fireplace that features an automatic shutoff, you might be interested in the <a href=\"/walker-edison-review\">Walker Edison Jackson</a>.","The Ameriwood doesn&#39;t have a timer function, but it is easy enough to turn the fireplace on and off. There are two switches on the front of the fireplace: one controls the heat while the other controls the flame effect. There are no heat settings â€“ it simply has the most basic ability to turn the heat on or off. You can leave the flames on for ambience without using heat, so you can use it year-round. There is no remote so you will need to manually turn the switches on and off. The fireplace itself is 18 inches wide and 17.5 inches tall, which is a little smaller than many other electric fireplaces.","The media center is made of laminated particle board and the insert&#39;s vent is situated in such a way that the wood doesn&#39;t heat up. The top surface has a weight threshold of 70 pounds and has space enough for a 50-inch TV. The whole unit is 47.25 inches wide, 31.75 inches tall and 15.88 inches deep. The cord measures about 6 feet long and comes out the back of the media center, which makes it easier to hide than cords on many other electric fireplaces.","This is a relatively heavy media center, weighing 95 pounds. You will need to assemble this electric fireplace TV stand upon delivery, or you can pay extra to have someone assemble it in your home. Tools are provided in shipping to help with assembly. If you choose to assemble it yourself, the process will probably take about an hour and you will want to have someone assisting you.","Ameriwood backs this electric fireplace TV stand with a one-year warranty. It is only available in one color, but it is sturdy and looks pleasant. If you have questions you can contact a company representative via email or phone."]},"id":"5551bc86-8d1e-46ee-b911-256f6f409efc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69549","url":"/ameriwood-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-07-26T15:18:09Z","datePublished":"2017-07-26T15:18:09Z","name":"Ameriwood Chicago 50\"","synopsis":"The Ameriwood Chicago electric fireplace only offers the most basic heating features.
