The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-home-subwoofers\">Home Subwoofers</a> here</em><em>.</em>","The 12-inch Theater Solutions Sub12F subwoofer will enhance the bass response of your home entertainment system, but you certainly get what you pay for with this subwoofer. This inexpensive subwoofer will not cost you an arm and a leg, but you lose out on overall sound quality.","There isn’t a standard way for speaker companies to test the peak power or RMS continuous power, and in some cases, the speakers specifications look better than what you get from the performance, and this one of those speakers.  The specifications of the Theater Solutions Sub12F lists that the dynamic peak power is 500 watts and the RMS continuous power measures 250 watts. However, the volume achieved by this subwoofer suggests otherwise. These specifications are among the most powerful and loudest within our subwoofer reviews, but unfortunately, this subwoofer doesn’t actually achieve them.","While the volume of this subwoofer leaves something to be desired, it can still fill up a small entertainment room. This small subwoofer is the only subwoofer on our lineup with a front-firing woofer and a front-firing port. To get the desired sound from your subwoofer, test it out in a couple different areas within the room to find the spot where you get the best bass response.","This subwoofer has two different types of inputs, including RCA line-in inputs and Hi Level inputs that you connect to the sub using speaker wire. The power button on the back of the subwoofer can be set to auto, so when the subwoofer isn’t in use for a certain period of time, the subwoofer will turn off. The gain knob controls volume and the crossover knob allows you to dial in the frequency response of the subwoofer to get the best tone possible.","We were disappointed with the lack of contact information for Theater Solutions. In order to contact the manufacturer, you need to fill out an online email form. Currently there isn’t a telephone number or any other form of contact information available on the Theater Solutions website."]},"id":"9af74c32-89d4-43c0-864c-3a969134a1b4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a4336a5a-00b8-4159-8df7-f35bf2f75228","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Theater Solutions Sub12F is a decent subwoofer if you are on a budget.
