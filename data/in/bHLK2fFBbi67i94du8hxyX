You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Joysway’s Offshore Warrior Lite <a href=\"/best-remote-control-boats\">remote control boat</a> is a mid-range model that’s sleek, fast and is outfitted with high-quality components. You can tell Joysway makes a quality boat: It runs quite well and really rips through the water, despite its smaller size.","The body of boat the boat has a deep V shape. It’s made of thick and heavy plastic that is quite durable. Since the boat is made of strong plastic, you shouldn’t have to worry about damaging it if you crash into something or collide with another racer.","This RC boat can reach speeds up to 16 mph, making it a good entry-level boat for racing. It’s definitely suited for beginner or intermediate racers and probably is a little under par for the serious racers. Many hobbyists would be inclined to upgrade the battery to make the boat faster and have longer run times. The run time for the recommend battery is eight minutes. Unfortunately, a boat battery or charger isn’t included, so you’ll have to purchase one separately. Joysway recommends a 7.4V 800mAh Li-ion battery pack.","This remote control boat has decent handling, but it’s better to gradually ease into turns rather than making fast, sharp turns. Because of this tendency, the boat is very easy to submarine. When the boat hops on the waves, sometimes the momentum pushes the hull forward and the boat dives headfirst into the water, especially after making a sharp turn. Just accelerate forward and the boat re-emerges. This can be a fun thing for some but annoying to others who’d rather the boat grip tightly to the water. Fortunately, the hull has a tight water-sealed enclosure that keeps the inner components sealed and pretty dry. The boat doesn’t have a self-righting feature, meaning if it flips over, you’ll have to retrieve it from the water.","The Offshore Warrior Lite remote control boat has a 90-day warranty. If you need replacement parts, the manufacturer has you covered, and they are available for purchase. Also, if you need help or support, you can reach the company via email or telephone. You can download the instruction manual and watch several YouTube videos of the boat in action. Also, online are forums about the boat, and the manufacturer has several social media accounts."]},"id":"9289982e-1407-4d0e-a220-64a27b953122","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1b230a4b-faca-49ef-87a2-840c56b8621d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Joysway Offshore Warrior Lite is a fun remote control boat that is a step above entry-level boats.
