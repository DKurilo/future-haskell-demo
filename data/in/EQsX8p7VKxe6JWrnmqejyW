It only operates 120 locations across the country, mostly at airports, which is far fewer than other rental companies like <a href=\"/services/auto/best-car-rental-services/hertz-review/\">Hertz</a> and <a href=\"/services/auto/best-car-rental-services/avis-review/\">Avis</a>. Airports tend to be more expensive to rent from than neighborhood offices, though its prices were competitive with other rental companies.","One drawback of a smaller company is a smaller fleet, so you’re less likely to find available vehicles, especially if you’re trying to book at a busy airport. To find out prices, we booked a week out and were generally successful in finding cars. When we tried to find a car for a next-day rental, we were often unsuccessful.  Since Payless offers lower rates for booking in advance, that’s what we recommend.","Even though the base prices are low, you’re subject to more taxes and fees since the only locations are at airports. Airports usually charge concession fees for renting, and most cities and states also tax car rentals. If you want to add another driver to your rental, Payless charges a $13 daily fee, which is on the higher end but not uncommon.","When you sign up for a Payless membership you receive coupons and offers through the company newsletter. This is about it for a rewards program. Payless doesn’t offer any other benefits, such as earning points toward free rentals or an expedited check-out line for members.","Payless doesn’t offer any home pick-up options, but it does have a complimentary airport shuttle that takes you from the terminal to the Payless rental office. This is standard for rental car companies with airport locations.","If price is your main motivator and you’re not a member of another rewards program, Payless is worth investigating, especially with its discounts for booking early and paying in advance. Still, it’s a relatively simple service and doesn’t offer much in the way of perks or add-ons."]},"id":"6a3bb685-e1df-43ea-98b2-a53008507032","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60621","url":"/payless-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-09-25T23:58:08Z","datePublished":"2014-09-25T23:58:08Z","name":"Payless","synopsis":"Payless is one of the smaller rental companies we reviewed.
