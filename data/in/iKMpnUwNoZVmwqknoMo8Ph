The infant car seat has most of the features that we look for and supports children from 5 to 35 pounds or 32 inches. The seat is compatible with several strollers and features a simple harness to make sure your child is safe and comfortable as he grows. Unfortunately, the car seat lacks a reclining base, so you&#39;ll have to use padding to level the seat. Also, the cushions are not machine washable, meaning that you&#39;ll have to handwash the seat to keep it clean.","The First Years Contigo meets all federal crash-testing requirements. The seat has energy-absorbent foam and side-impact protection. With its color-coded seatbelt path, you won&#39;t have to guess how to connect the seat. For even easier installation, it has LATCH connectors. The seat will support a child from infancy to about 2 years of age, or 5 to 35 pounds. However, most premature babies are born under 5 pounds, so you&#39;ll have to buy an extra infant cushion insert if you have a 4-pound preemie.","The Contigo easily disconnects from its stay-in-car base and fits multiple strollers, including The First Years Burst and the JJCole Monroe. The installation instructions are clear and easy to understand, and as your child grows, you can adjust the harness without rethreading the straps. The canopy and adjustable carry handle have good space between each other, so you can use both at the same time.","There are some annoying factors to keep in mind, though. Neither the carrier nor the base reclines, so you&#39;ll have to buy extra pads to make sure that the car seat is at the correct angle. Also, the cushions are not machine washable. That means when your child makes a mess of his new car seat, you&#39;ll have to handwash everything. Finally, we were not impressed with The First Years&#39; customer service. Agents are available by email and phone, but we had trouble getting in touch with anyone through either method. Eventually, we received a response to our email, but it took much longer than we expected."]},"id":"068a2257-c93e-4f06-a033-600b41962025","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cdfccba6-c23e-4c45-99d4-bdb9bb7e149c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The First Years Contigo is a comfortable baby car seat with many of the features that we look for.
