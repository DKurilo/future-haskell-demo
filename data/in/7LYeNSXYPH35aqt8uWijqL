You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The name Whirlpool is welcome in laundry rooms worldwide, and the company is a leader among appliances. This Whirlpool LCE4332PQ <a href=\"/best-portable-washing-machines\">portable washing machine</a> is stunning. Its white cabinet is trim and compact, and its top-loading lid and digital control panel are streamlined and clean. If you are concerned that you will grow tired of looking at your washer every day, this aesthetically pleasing Whirlpool compact model is the answer.","Beauty and fame aren&#39;t everything, however. The Whirlpool LCE4332PQ has its conveniences, but it also forgoes some practical functions. Like all the portable washing machines in our lineup, it includes a faucet adaptor for the water inlet hose. It has three wash and spin-speed combinations, reaching a high of 750 rotations per minute. It also has four automatic cycles: normal, heavy duty, quick wash and delicate, and that&#39;s about it. If you enjoy the flexibility of customizable cycles, you are out of luck. If you will go insane without a cycle countdown, delay start or end-of-cycle signal, you should also look elsewhere for your portable washer needs.","However, if your laundry needs are basic and you don&#39;t want the hassle of additional wash options, you will be content with this fully automatic washer. It holds up to 2.1 cubic feet of laundry, which is one of the largest capacities in our lineup and more than half the capacity of most full-size washing machines. Its straight-vane agitator cleans even the toughest dirt out of clothes.","The cabinet of the Whirlpool portable washer does not have handles, but at 148 pounds, any unnecessary lifting would be a nuisance. Instead, install and use the casters to move your unit from the closet to the sink and back between loads.","Water levels in this compact washer are automatic, although there are only two levels from which to choose. For small and large loads, these levels are convenient. For anything in-between, the judgment call is yours. The simple digital control pad allows you to select easily which level and cycle suits your load.","Don&#39;t worry about making return trips to your portable washing machine. Once you&#39;ve started a load, the automatic cycle plus time-release detergent, bleach and softener dispensers finish the chore for you. The washer efficiently spins clothes, so line drying is a breeze. Keep a lint-roller on hand though, because the Whirlpool LCE4332PQ does not have an internal lint filter.","This portable washer does not include any external features to muffle excess noise. However, many owners have no problem in the level of noise this machine emits. Some have even praised its silent operation. Adjustable legs allow you to level your machine – even on uneven floor surfaces. A level surface is vital for a properly functioning, well-balanced washing machine, so make sure you adjust yours carefully.","Whirlpool offers a limited 10-year warranty on the outer tub of the LCE4332PQ portable washing machine. The company also covers the top, lid and gear case for seven years and all labor and replacement parts for the first year."]},"id":"9d64d537-992d-4354-a0f7-ca1c5dba7e00","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b7f7ffcc-0d3d-4090-a26a-1d52a24265f0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though it&#39;s nice to look at, the Whirlpool LCE4332PQ lacks some vital features.
