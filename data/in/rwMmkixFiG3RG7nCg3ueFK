You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When looking into <a href=\"/best-video-editing-software\">video editing software</a>, it can be difficult trying to decide which features you need. Muvee autoProducer doesn&#39;t have nearly as many features as some of the other applications we looked at. It doesn&#39;t give you much control over the editing options; instead, everything is programmed in automatically. This and the overall lack of features make this application a little troublesome to use if you want complete control over the editing process. If all you want to do is change the format of a file, you may find this application useful.","Muvee autoProducer imports clips but doesn&#39;t have many options for capturing a video from a device. It gives you some control over how you can rearrange the clips, but if you want to add more than opening and closing credits, you are out of luck. This particular video editing software doesn&#39;t even let you chose where each clip starts and stops. This application&#39;s only real feature is to take an existing video clip and export it in another format. Beyond that, you may want to look into getting another application for the editing process.","One of the few options that are unique to this software is its music-video-creation tool. The application can adjust the speed of a movie to fit with the timing of a song. While this is useful, if it doesn&#39;t match up exactly how you want it to, there is nothing you can do about it. This is one of the automated features that don&#39;t give you any room to tweak the outcome, so hopefully you get lucky when using this option and everything matches up how you want it to. This is a time saver when it works right, and it is a handy in theory.","Muvee autoProducer is the simplest tool we found to create fun music videos from your movies. This application is set up to handle video formats such as ASF, AVI, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MP4, WMV and MOV. It is also fairly good if you want to add captions, voiceover, music and credits. However, the application doesn’t allow you the freedom to modify your video or perform advanced editing. There are a few options for adding effects and transitions, but they are limited and you don’t have much control over them. The output formats are also limited to a handful of formats, and it is somewhat cumbersome to export the files.","The help and support offered by the manufacturer for this video editing software is limited to a support ticket and a few FAQs. While we appreciated that there is a way to get personalized help from the technical support team, we wish there were a few more options to get help for this application such as a printed manual and a phone number for more direct support."]},"id":"2ed8cb43-557c-4e18-84e1-8f6d7d349842","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6c63696c-90ca-4d44-a107-a6b4150606b3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, Muvee autoProducer is an application that is only useful if you don’t want to do any editing or add many effects. The auto-editing tools are useful for saving time, but they don’t allow you to make little changes for the best results. We would have liked to see more tools that don&#39;t rely on the application&#39;s algorithms.
