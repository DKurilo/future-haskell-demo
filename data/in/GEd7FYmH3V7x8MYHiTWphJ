Weighing only 1.75 pounds, it’s the smallest concentrator that we reviewed, making it a great option for users with an active lifestyle or who simply don’t want a bulky oxygen delivery system weighing them down. Only the <a href=\"/inogen-review\">Inogen One G4</a> and the <a href=\"/inova-labs-review\">Inova Labs ActivOx 4L</a> are close in weight.","In addition to being light, it is also compact, measuring 6.4 inches tall, 4.8 inches wide and 2.5 inches deep. The device comes with a carrying case that has an adjustable shoulder strap for added portability and comfort.","Unfortunately, one of the downsides of being small and lightweight is that this personal oxygen concentrator doesn’t have as big of a battery as other devices. Though it comes with two lithium ion batteries, each one only lasts for about three hours, depending on the flow rate setting you need to use. It also comes with both AC and DC power options for charging via an outlet. All of the batteries are easily rechargeable, and can be back up to full capacity in about four hours.","You can purchase an additional external power cartridge, if needed, which will give you up to 3.5 additional hours. However, this isn’t just another battery chunk you use to replace of the main one attached to the concentrator – it’s a pack that’s worn around your waist with a Velcro strap. However, the strap makes it easy to carry and gives you a little extended run time if you’re travelling. The device is also FAA approved, so you can use it on passenger flights.","The Airsep Focus is a pulse flow concentrator and won’t work for those who need a continuous flow. It provides small bursts of oxygen for each breath you take and runs quietly at around 41 decibels (which is equal to about a whisper). You can also turn the system on or off with the flick of a switch that’s located on the power cord.","With its compact, lightweight build, the Airsep Focus is a great portable oxygen concentrator option for active users. Its small size makes it easy to travel with, though its batter isn’t as long-lasting in comparison to other models."]},"id":"24aebab7-eff1-49bb-bb03-c4130fa5b2ad","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68653","url":"/caire-medical-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alexander-eriksen","url":"/author/alexander-eriksen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Alexander Eriksen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"hwemruvZsTXWMqRixKJ49","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-28T20:46:38Z","datePublished":"2016-10-28T20:46:38Z","name":"Caire Medical Airsep Focus","synopsis":"If having a lightweight portable oxygen concentrator is important to you, then the Airsep Focus is definitely an option you should consider.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"If having a lightweight portable oxygen concentrator is important to you, then the Airsep Focus is definitely an option you should consider.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-28T20:46:38Z","id":"GEd7FYmH3V7x8MYHiTWphJ","meta":{"title":"Caire Medical Airsep Focus Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Airsep Focus is a lightweight and compact portable oxygen concentrator that&#8217;s easy to take with you anywhere, even on a flight.
