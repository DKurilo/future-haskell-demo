Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When Samsung released the Galaxy S6, its first flagship with an all metal-and-glass construction, we were understandably excited. Other smartphones had done the same thing, certainly, but this was Samsung – for years, the company packed incredible components into phones with rickety, cheap-feeling frames. Premium build materials were a long time coming.","In the Galaxy Note5, Samsung is taking the S6’s metal-and-glass design and, essentially, making it bigger. You wouldn’t be wrong to see it as the natural successor to last year’s Note 4; it does, after all, still pack a massive screen, a solid battery and the Note’s trademark S Pen. You can also think of the Note5 as a plus-size Galaxy S6. It packs most of the same components. It sports the same camera and offers the same home-button fingerprint scanner. There’s just more phone to go around.","But is that enough? Does bigger really mean better when it comes to the world’s next Galaxy?","In short, yes, but that doesn’t mean it’s definitely for you. If you’re looking for a premium experience and you need to have one of the best Android smartphones money can buy, regardless of how tiny your pants pockets might be, then the Galaxy Note5 is superb.

Don’t get us wrong, it’s a huge phone. Even in an era of 5.2-inch flagships, a device that’s half a foot tall and 3 inches wide demands attention. The Note5 is better suited to purses and jacket pockets than skinny jeans, and that’s if you stay case-free. Its curved rear cover nestles in your palm, and its rounded edges keep the device from biting into your skin. It’s easily the most comfortable phablet we’ve ever held.","It’s sturdy, too.

Ironically, we almost wish it took more pointers; the sensors on the front of our white model stand out in a decidedly inelegant manner, while the square camera bump on the back looks glued on next to the iPhone’s graceful, minimalist circle.","But we’re nitpicking.

The features and extras Samsung loaded into the Galaxy Note5 aren’t outlandish, but they aren’t about the push the industry forward, either.","One of the best features is unquestionably the S Pen. For years, the Note series has been the only major smartphone line to consistently offer pen input, and the easily stowed S Pen keeps improving year after year. With this iteration comes instant note taking: If the phone’s off, you can pull out the S Pen and the screen immediately turns to a low-power, monochromatic note-taking display.

It’s far prettier to look at than the Note5, but it’s nowhere near as comfortable to hold. And of course, it has those curved edges.","We played with both the Edge+ and the Note5 for days on end. We showed them both to friends and family, used them to watch videos and play games, browse the web, and stream music. We took tons of photos with each, charged them and depleted them several times over, and we were left with one rather profound realization: There’s no good reason for the Edge+ to exist."]},"id":"af9ed01c-09ae-4996-a4f8-01ea0a398e56","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/CuayBgsj2MJLd2RBqkwq63.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/66653-samsung-galaxy-note513.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CuayBgsj2MJLd2RBqkwq63.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"CuayBgsj2MJLd2RBqkwq63","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CuayBgsj2MJLd2RBqkwq63.jpg","alt":""},"id":"1d637a1a-1a3f-48d6-b6c5-e7ed534c2d9e","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Don’t get us wrong – it’s a brilliant phone.

Unlike the original Galaxy S6 Edge, the Edge+’s curves aren’t used for dedicated apps or notifications. There’s a slide-out modal that you can populate with contacts or an app launcher, but that could easily have been done with any phone. The thinner edges dig into your hand when you hold the device, and the curved screen is a constant source of glare – if there’s a light source around you, that curved screen catches it."]},"id":"de91e7f3-f5b6-4b08-a959-74d703a674a5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"35460789-8f99-4adf-89fd-5f60240c5593","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung Galaxy Note5 is a beast of a smartphone.
