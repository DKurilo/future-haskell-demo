You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","VTrain is different from many of the other <a href=\"/best-vocabulary-software\">vocabulary software</a> applications we reviewed because it is essentially a flash card generator. This application doesn&#39;t come with any pre-loaded vocabulary words. You create the flash cards you need to learn the words you want. This vocabulary builder software is ideal for people who want to form their own vocabulary learning experience.","To register your copy of VTrain, you can either purchase a license or donate to any charity organization that fights hunger in Africa. The company has an approved list of charitable, non-governmental organizations on the site to ensure that your money goes to the right place.","VTrain is also available in German, Spanish and French versions. This vocabulary software includes an on-screen keyboard for 100 different languages. In addition to being a useful vocabulary builder for your own language, you can also use this application to learn new words in another language. Your experience with VTrain is entirely dependent on the words you put into it.","However, despite the simplicity of the idea, creating your own flash cards with VTrain isn&#39;t as easy as it should be. We found that there is a learning curve as you enter words, definitions and even images. It took us a while to really figure out how to create an effective flash card.","Once you&#39;ve entered a word into the VTrain application, there is an audio option with which you can record the correction pronunciation of each word. These audible pronunciations are helpful in learning and retaining new vocabulary words and are a useful tool in this vocabulary building application. You can also set a schedule of repetitions to review each new word periodically.","VTrain uses file synchronization to enable several people to use the same decks of flash cards. This can be a very useful tool if you are teaching a class or if you and some friends are preparing for a trip abroad. This vocabulary software can also group words together by difficulty, and it will repeat words more often if they&#39;re answered incorrectly."]},"id":"a1d4ae2f-d9a8-416c-a503-6fd6db89aad0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fd89a74a-21b4-4a50-b3d7-475e401b5d0c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["VTrain is a very basic application that helps you create flash cards based on the words you want to learn.
