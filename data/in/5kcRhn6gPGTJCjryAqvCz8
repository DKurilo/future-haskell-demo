Most insurance providers ask for multiple quotes from different service providers. Hiring a service during a trying time can be stressful, so here are some guidelines to help you make your decision.","<strong>Service Area</strong><br/>While most restoration services are national, ensure that there is a service provider in your immediate vicinity to give you optimal service.

Note that mold remediation and mold removal are quite different. If your home has suffered flooding, you may want to ensure that the team offers thorough mold remediation services.

Ensure that not only your home is inspected but also your furniture, clothing, closets and any non-ventilated area where mold can flourish.","<strong>Damage to Household Goods</strong><br/>Many companies that offer fire damage recovery also can help revitalize documents and personal belongings. If a fire affected an office area, ensure that you also get a quote for document restoration. Make sure your provider includes drying out sofa cushions, mattresses and other high-end pieces of furniture in addition to drying walls, floors and crawl spaces.","<strong>Biohazard Cleanup</strong><br/>Flooding and fires can wreak havoc on areas surrounding your home. If you have a septic tank that was impacted by a flood, you may need to investigate a biohazard removal team. This could also be necessary for any workshops that had toxic solvents or paints, as well as businesses that could be leaking toxic materials into local water supplies. If you are remotely concerned that you may need this specialty, look for a service that can advise you on hazardous materials and can dispose of them safely and legally.","Unfortunately, accidents and emergencies are sometimes unavoidable.

If needed, carpeting and padding are removed to ensure complete and thorough drying. Affected furniture and household goods are removed and stored to ensure that the company&#39;s team can complete the drying process efficiently.","Stanley Steemer&#39;s trained staff members use advanced water detection equipment to search for any trapped moisture. As is standard with any water removal service, large industrial fans and commercial-grade dehumidifying equipment are installed to completely dry out your home. The equipment remains active until daily inspections determine it can be safely removed.","If you are concerned about the start and spread of mold, Stanley Steemer does not provide services to aid in its detection or removal. Mold remediation services are a separate specialty and require different equipment. Severe water damage can cause the spread of mold, and if you want to use a single provider for mold cleanup and water removal, you may want to consult a different emergency restoration service. If your water damage occurred in relation to a fire, you may want to consult a provider who can provide fire damage restoration services simultaneously.","Stanley Steemer can help with immediate water cleanup rather than longstanding water issues. It has a guaranteed 15-minute callback window and is on site within three hours of the initial call. However, it doesn&#39;t offer mold removal or cleanup of smoke-related damage from a fire.","<a href=\"#Back_to_Top\">Back to Top</a>"]},"id":"507fc15e-9da9-409d-8847-b02ac415d6a5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10259","url":"/best-restoration-damage-and-cleanup-services-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-21T15:13:07Z","datePublished":"2016-11-21T15:13:07Z","name":"Best Restoration Damage and Cleanup Services Review","synopsis":"If a disaster has damaged your home, the immediate intervention of a deep cleaning service is needed.","review":{},"strapline":"If a disaster has damaged your home, the immediate intervention of a deep cleaning service is needed.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-11-21T17:13:51Z","id":"5kcRhn6gPGTJCjryAqvCz8","meta":{"title":"Best Restoration Damage and Cleanup Services Review","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
