This <a href=\"/best-fondue-pots\">fondue set</a> is a best-seller for a good reason. Melting cheese for dipping bread or creating one-of-a-kind desserts, entrees and hors d&#39;oeuvres is easy and stylish with this 2-quart fondue pot.","Cooking and serving fondue with this pot is a fun activity for dinner parties. You and your guests can dip fruit in chocolate or bread in melted cheese. Included in the set is a fondue stand, fork holder, fuel holder, snuffer, 2-quart saucepan and six dipping forks. The forks all have the same black handle, so you and your guests will have to keep track of whose fork is whose without color coding.","The sleek red design makes this pot an attractive addition to any kitchen or party, adding just enough elegance and color to make any kitchen it is placed in seem a bit more stylish. The pot is safe to put in the dishwasher, so it&#39;s quick and easy to clean it compared to you having to wash it by hand. The stainless steel construction makes it heat up quickly and evenly, so your fondue will stay warm throughout your party. It is also safe to put this fondue pot in the oven at up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, in case you prefer to heat up your fondue that way.","You will also notice the color-coordinated easy-grip handle, which is double riveted to provide extra support and make the pot easier to handle. It&#39;s padded in bright red to match the pot.","This fondue pot is not electric, meaning it runs on fuel that you will have to keep buying instead of just plugging the pot in. This is true to the traditional, classy fondue party experience, but it also means you have to plan ahead and make sure you have enough fuel before whipping out the fondue pot at parties.","You can purchase accessories for the Rachael Ray fondue set, including the two-piece Lazy Spoon and Ladle Set, which is convenient for stirring thick sauces without drips, and a pasta fork.","The Rachael Ray Stainless Steel II Fondue Set makes a festive attraction at parties, both for its attractive red hue and the fondue it makes with its quick and even heating. It&#39;s safe to use in both the dishwasher and the oven, though its traditional makeup means you have to keep replenishing its fuel rather than simply plugging it in when you need it."]},"id":"eb5f4309-3212-40f7-a855-5f6eb16e5565","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61620","url":"/rachael-ray-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-16T17:19:03Z","datePublished":"2014-12-16T17:19:03Z","name":"Rachael Ray Stainless Steel II 2-qt.
