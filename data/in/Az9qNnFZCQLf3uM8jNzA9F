During that time, we’ve developed standard image tests that put these printers through their paces. We’ve also seen printers with more connectivity options and higher print resolutions become accessible for home offices.","As we test, we look for professional print quality and spend hours evaluating each machine’s strengths and weaknesses. We don’t just test them once, either. We make sure each printer can reproduce the same quality photos again and again, without errors or wearing down.","We look at the photos printed by each machine side-by-side to directly compare quality from one printer to another. We also archive prints for later use so we can compare them to photos printed on newer models or all-new devices.","<strong>How Much Does a Photo-Only Printer Cost?</strong>","When we reviewed photo-only printers, we looked at both portable and professional models. It’s worth mentioning that even at the higher end of the price range, home photo printers don’t quite match the quality of professional printers. On average, the desktop photo-only printers we tested cost around $350. The snapshot printers were a little less expensive, with prices between $100 and $150. The most portable printers were a little more expensive than the snapshot printers by a small margin, costing just over $125.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We unboxed the printers, installed all their mobile applications and explored the machine’s connectivity options. The best models can print over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB or SD card. We also noted which applications let you sync the printer with online accounts, such as Instagram or Facebook. At a basic level, we checked to see that each app can successfully connect the printer to your phone when you follow its instructions.","We printed a variety of photos, including portraits and landscapes, to test the printers’ capabilities and all-around quality. We also printed some images with colorful objects to test how well the printers reproduce detail and depth. We evaluated whether each printer separated objects with clean lines and noted banding or visible lines made by the print head. We also put the photos under lighted-magnification to see if the printers reproduced the quality of the original, digital images.","Print speed is important for smaller snapshot printers, especially if you plan to use some of their party or social features, like the Canon Selphy’s Party Shuffle mode. We printed the same images on all the devices and timed how long it took to print each one. We averaged the print speeds, taking photo size into account.","While print quality was our number one consideration, we also looked at each machine’s physical dimensions, portability and value.","<strong>What Key Features to Look for When Buying Photo-Only Printers</strong>","Print Quality<br/>A good way to know what kind of print quality to expect is to check the kind of printing technology a machine uses. Inkjet printers create the highest quality photos, but there are also dye-sublimation printers, which aren’t quite as good but simplify cartridge installation. Zero ink, also called “zink,” models are speedy but produce prints that aren’t very bright or vivid.","Print Speed<br/>Based on how you plan to use your printer, whether in a classroom or at social events, speed can be important. Manufacturers often provide information about speed in the printers’ specifications, and we also tested print speed in our lab.","Portability<br/>As with speed, how you plan to use your printer affects how portable you need it to be. If you need to use yours on the go, we recommend finding a machine with a battery pack included in the initial purchase. Also, look at how many images the device can print before it needs to recharge. It’s also worth mentioning that more portable devices don’t have the same high print quality as stationary printers.","Connectivity<br/>Even some of the smaller snapshot printers we tested have a lot of connectivity options. Photo printers may offer any combination of wired, USB and Ethernet connections as well as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth so you can print directly from your social media accounts and cell phone.","If you are looking for a large-format, desktop photo printer, look for one that has a lot of connectivity options, especially if you plan to share it with other users. On the other hand, if you want a portable printer, often less is more – we liked portable printers that have simple connectivity options that make it easy to start printing right away.","<strong>Best Photo Book Services </strong>","The photo printers we tested are the perfect solution for printing single high-quality images for framing. However, if you want to combine multiple images in a nicely bound keepsake photo book, we also compared 13 of the <a href=\"/best-photo-books\">best photo book</a> printing services by evaluating print quality, pricing and book template options. Here are a couple of our favorite photo book sites.","<a href=\"/mixbook-review\">Mixbook</a><br/>This online photo book service has the largest selection of pre-designed book templates, and our test project arrived faster than any other online service we tested. The interface is easy to use and includes a guided virtual tour highlighting the important features and tools. Mixbook offers a 20-page 8 x 8 hardcover photo book for $29.99 plus shipping and handling, and each additional page is $1.29. That’s an average price for our test group, but the print quality of this service was among the best we evaluated.","<a href=\"/walgreens-photo-review\">Walgreens Photo</a><br/>The print quality of Walgreens’ photo books isn’t on par with the best services we tested, but an 8 x 8 book only costs $19.99 and is available to pick up at Walgreens stores the same day you design it. There are six different sizes to choose from with six cover options, including hardbound, softbound, leather and fabric.
