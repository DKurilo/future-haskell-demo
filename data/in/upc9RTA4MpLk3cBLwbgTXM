The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-over-the-range-microwaves\">Over-the-Range Microwave Ovens</a> here.</em>","The Maytag MMV series offers simplistically attractive microwaves with varying features in each unit so you can pick the right one to fit your needs. The Maytag MMV5208WS has slightly fewer features than some of the over-the-range microwaves we reviewed, but it costs quite a bit less than others with similar features.","The MMV5208WS offers sensor cooking to make your life a little easier by taking the guesswork out of microwaving. Humidity sensors detect the amount of moisture in your food to determine if it is done or if it needs a little more time. Sensor reheat will also detect the moisture in your leftovers, heating them to the ideal temperature without drying them out. This model doesn’t include convection cooking, but Maytag&#39;s MMV series does include an over-range microwave with this feature.","Other features in this over-range microwave that are useful include quick defrost, auto defrost and frozen entrée options. The settings are programmed with a good idea of how long specific meals and items take to defrost or cook. If your kids like to make their own snacks, you&#39;ll appreciate the pre-programmed kids&#39; meals options. And if you need to limit the amount of cooking your kids do, you can activate the child lock, which also comes in handy when you need to clean up after sticky fingers and wipe the keypad clean.","The wide-glide tray is an interesting feature that replaces the standard turntable. This tray will move back a forth in the microwave during use to more evenly cook your food. And you can turn the tray off when you don&#39;t need it. Other models in this series have a regular turntable. An included cooking rack also makes it easy to configure more food inside this over-the-range microwave oven. You basically double your cooking surface with the rack. At 2.0 cubic feet, the interior space is already pretty expansive to begin with, so adding another level is going to allow you to prepare quite a bit of food at the same time. Other models in the series have less interior space, so the rack will be especially handy in those models.","One additional feature you are sure to appreciate is the filter reset indicator. Regular maintenance is extremely important; charcoal filters must be replaced regularly, and grease filters must be cleaned about once a month to keep the microwave operating well. After performing this maintenance, you can simply reset the indicator and it will warn you again when it is time to clean or replace the filters.","This built-in microwave&#39;s hood has a nice design, with a versatile exhaust fan for either interior recirculation or exterior venting. The fan runs at four different speeds, clearing up to 300 cubic feet per minute. The incandescent cooktop lights will illuminate your stovetop, and it has a timer you can program to turn the lights on and off at specific times.","The overall appearance of this over-the-range microwave is appealing, particularly the hidden vent available in this series. The wide range of colors available is nice if you are just replacing one appliance and not the entire kitchen. If you like this unit, you are sure to find it in a shade that will match your decor.","The Maytag website is fairly good with information logically laid out and easy to find. The Maytag MMV user manuals are weak, however, seeming more like a list of safety warnings than in-depth instructions. We’re not saying you need to be a rocket scientist to use this over-the-range microwave, but it will require some instruction, especially if you have not used recent innovations such as sensor cooking.","Maytag redeems itself with a great warranty on the main component – the magnetron, which is covered for 10 years. Other parts and labor coverage lasts for the standard first year."]},"id":"a867eecd-0f6f-49a6-8141-8fe44e217d5b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f014dee9-52e8-400c-bbf4-f10a2ee7c39d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We like the Maytag MMV5208WS over-the-range microwave.
