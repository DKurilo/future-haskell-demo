Both are essentially the same in terms of benefits and services. The plans provide all the extras you’d expect from a premium membership. Best Roadside Service offers 24-hour nationwide service in both the U.S. and Canada. The vehicle plan provides annual coverage on a specific vehicle, not the primary member on the account. This works well for individuals and families with only one car as anyone who is driving that vehicle can take advantage of the assistance in an emergency. Since many families have multiple vehicles, Best also offers an individual plan that, as the name implies, covers an individual person, not a specific vehicle.","Best Roadside Service provides coverage for a variety of road service needs. Six service calls are allowed per year on each covered vehicle, which is above the average of four service calls allowed by our other ranked breakdown services. Six is a generous number and it should cover most of your needs over the course of a year. It covers towing service up to 75 miles and fuel delivery. Unlike certain other services, Best Roadside Service provides up to 3 gallons of gas for free. The standard flat tire change, dead battery jump and lock-out services are available as well. Best also administers a lost key service with a locksmith reimbursement of $100.","No signup fee is required for new members, and you can add on other personal vehicles for an additional cost, up to a maximum of four vehicles. You have the option of paying annually or monthly. The company offers breakdown services for motorcycles, but you will need to purchase a separate plan. RVs and trailers are not covered. Best Roadside Service also offers roadside assistance for commercial, fleet and rental vehicles under the commercial plan.","This road service includes several perks with its annual membership, but the one feature that stands out is the personal concierge service. Concierge service is usually reserved for the premium plans of other emergency roadside assistance providers but comes standard with each Best Roadside Service membership.","The 24-hour concierge service is a great membership benefit; as an example, if you’re traveling and need help reserving a hotel room or a rental car, they can book it for you. Other membership benefits include retail discounts for hotel and travel packages, emergency transportation services and trip-planning services."]},"id":"77d1e44b-79b5-4586-a335-372f4d09d3c1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4c74a466-6f9c-4d42-b9d1-92638ee842eb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Best Roadside Service provides good roadside assistance with premium, emergency roadside services. It also offers benefits found in more expensive plans like travel discounts, 24-hour personal concierge services and trip-planning services.
