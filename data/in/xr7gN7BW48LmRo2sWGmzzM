We spoke to John Van Alst of the National Consumer Law Center. He told us that 70 percent of auto financing comes from dealerships. Consumers should know that dealerships generate most of their revenue from their financing and service departments. It’s worthwhile to check at your bank or credit union to see what you’re eligible for before financing through a dealership. Dealerships may advertise attractive deals, like 0% APRs, but only customers with the best credit scores are eligible for those offers. ","In researching the best auto lenders, we primarily considered banks and credit unions which tend to offer better interest rates than dealerships and other types of lenders. We also included a few services that help you find multiple loan offers, so you can choose the loan with the length and rate that works best for you.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","To arrive at our ranking of auto lenders we compared the rates, terms and application process for each lender. Comparing rates is tricky; lenders base interest rates on your credit score, your debt-to-income ratio, the age of the car and how much you put down on the car, so they can vary widely. The rates we list come from each lender’s website and generally reflect the rosiest scenarios, like excellent credit and a low debt to income ratio. Your actual rate will probably vary considerably. And if you have less-than-excellent credit, your rate can be one percentage point higher – or more. According to Experian, the average interest rate on an auto loan is 5.17%, and many of the lenders offer potential rates much lower than that.","Loan terms typically range from 12 months to 84 months, and 60 months is about average for a car. A longer term can be helpful because you have lower monthly payments, but a longer term means you’ll pay more in interest over the life of the loan, increasing the real cost of your car.","We also looked for fees that lenders add. One of the more common fees is a prepayment penalty, or a fee for paying the debt early. Some loans precalculate the interest and include it in the loan, so even if you pay it off early, you still pay all the interest. Look for a loan with simple interest, one that calculates interest based on how much you owe.","<strong>What to Know Before Applying for an Auto Loan</strong>","An auto loan isn’t a mortgage, but it’s still a significant expense that affects your finances. Before applying here are some things to do.","Check Your Credit: Knowing your credit score before you apply can give you a clearer idea of what rates you can expect to pay. There are many free options for checking your credit score, and some credit cards offer free monthly credit checks.","Get Preapproved: Getting preapproved for a loan gives you an advantage when shopping for cars. By knowing how much you can afford, you’ll be better positioned to negotiate with dealers.","Come Prepared: To apply for an auto loan, you’ll need to provide the lender with the necessary documents. Most want to see proof of income, credit and banking history, proof of residence and proof of insurance. Getting a loan through your current bank or credit union makes this step much easier, since they will have much of this information on hand.","Remember Your Budget: This goes for your monthly payment, down payment and the total loan. Make sure you can afford the monthly payment. You don’t want to fall behind and risk losing the car. According to an Experian study, the average monthly payment on an auto loan is around $532. You’ll also need a down payment, usually 20% for a new car and 10% for a used car.","Use Dealers as a Last Resort: Dealers may sometimes be your only option, especially if you have poor credit. But always try and find financing through a bank or credit union because you’ll usually get a lower rate. Dealers also tend to add markups to the interest rates, so you’ll end up paying more if you get a loan through a dealership.","Avoid Add-Ons: Dealers will often try to up-sell you additional features. Some of these include window tinting, anti-theft devices and interior protection packages. Van Alst reports that add-ons like these are where many of the most egregious markups occur, with no transparency or consistency in the pricing. It’s best to avoid them.","<strong>2019 Auto Loan Trends</strong>","If you are planning to buy a car in 2019, here are some things to look for in the new year:","<em>Rates Will Go Up:</em> Auto loan rates will continue to rise in step with expected Fed rate increases. According to <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/loans/auto-loans/current-auto-loan-interest-rates/\">Bankrate</a>, interest rates on new car loans are around 5%, with rates rising to 5.5% on five-year car loans, 6.4% on four-year loans and 6.25% on three-year loans. Your rate may vary depending on your credit score.","<em>Car Prices Will Rise:</em> In general, cars are getting more expensive. This is due in some part to rising commodity prices and a general preference for trucks and SUVs. Because of rising prices, auto buyers are also taking out longer loans, which increases the total cost and in the long term can lead buyers to pay for an increasingly depreciating asset.","<em>Used Cars Won’t Be Cheaper:</em> As new cars become more expensive, dealers will look to their used car inventories to make sales. However, don’t expect used car prices to decrease – though you may still be able to find deals, dealerships won’t be as desperate to move used cars as in years past.","<em>Fees Will Go Up:</em> Because dealer margins on cars will go down, they’ll try to make it up by adding fees and extras. Dealers add a documentation fee that can range from $100 to $500, and it is typically one of the hardest fees to get them to negotiate on. The finance department will also try to get you to add various extras like warranties","Even though most trends point to cars getting more expensive, if you need to buy a new car, there’s no use waiting for the market to shift toward being buyer-friendly. You can always negotiate with car dealers, and if you go at the end of the month, they may be more eager to cut a deal. Also, if you can pay cash or a large down payment, you should."]},"id":"9e0abba9-a639-40c0-8e03-4df52d47892c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_348","url":"/best-auto-loan-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-23T21:50:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-23T21:50:00Z","name":"Best Auto Loans of 2019","synopsis":"We looked at credit unions, banks, direct lenders and brokers in search of the best auto loans.
