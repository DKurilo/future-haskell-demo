You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Smartphones were once almost exclusively the tools of high powered business users and road warriors. The original Apple iPhone, and more significantly, the iPhone 3G, were the single greatest catalysts in expanding smartphones’ appeal to the general consumer audience. The Apple iPhone 3GS (‘S’ for Speed) continues the trend of improvements we enjoyed with the 3G. Certainly more evolutionary than revolutionary, the folks at Apple listened to the criticisms that were leveled at the wildly popular iPhone 3G and actually took action on most of the issues. While competitors have made major strides in closing the gap between the iPhone and everyone else, this is still the phone to beat for most users. For a side-by-side comparison and objective reviews, visit the <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> page.","We won’t rehash the well known features of the iPhone 3G. For details of that excellent smartphone, you can <a href=\"/apple-iphone-3g-16-gb-23036-review\">check out its review</a>. Instead, we’ll highlight the improvements that make the iPhone 3GS a top choice for a wide variety of users."]},"id":"26de24c0-b277-48b0-9070-be5ec127cc93","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"fd2bf65e-f304-4ca3-b393-73f907d05d22","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The iPhone 3GS catches up with some of the top competitors by finally offering document editing features.

Most notably, it’s a perfectly good smartphone that just happens to have an iPod built-in. Just as the iPod essentially created and continues to dominate the digital music industry, the iPhone invented and rules the world of mobile apps. Despite the launching of competing app stores by several other smartphone makers, they all pale compared to the tens of thousands, and rapidly expanding, of apps available for the iPhone.","iPhone’s rather weak 2.0-megapixel camera has been updated to a 3.0-megapixel shooter which is better than its predecessor but is still not among the best available. Nonetheless, Apple has made great strides with the Tap to Focus system that give the user a lot more control over pictures to be taken. Oddly, there still isn’t a flash. The new iPhone does satisfy users who bemoaned the lack of video capture capability. That’s a feature that is rapidly gaining importance with meteoric rise in popularity of posting videos online. It also includes a great video editing tool that should help users improve the often dubious quality of those online posts."]},"id":"157d77ae-00a5-4f92-a23f-79064663a63f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Camera"},"id":"754e9ae6-7b63-4c03-897a-506013d33fce","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Increased speed is the central improvement of the iPhone 3GS.

We&#39;re still not particularly pleased that there&#39;s no option for memory expansion but with that much storage embedded, the argument is irrelevant for most users. (The previous version had 16GB and 8GB options). Both models are available in both black and white.","Among the chief complaints about previous editions of the iPhone was the absence of a user replaceable battery. That hasn’t changed but at least Apple has equipped the new device with a battery that seems to be providing markedly improved performance. We like the <a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">AppBox Pro</a> app that, among other things, estimates how much battery life is available for various phone functions. We’ve found that it does a good job of predicting actual battery life.
