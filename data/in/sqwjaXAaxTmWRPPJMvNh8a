For them, having a keyboard without backlit keys is like having no keyboard at all. Secondary to this need for light is the mobility and convenience that comes with a wireless keyboard. The Logitech Wireless Illuminated Keyboard K800, although not quite as eco-conscious as its sister wireless solar keyboard, definitely gives the people what they want."]},"id":"407d8465-75fc-4f3d-990c-628a367dd6fc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"cde30d83-3c2c-47f0-9f40-2e8e0501ebec","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/9bae5ntWbJiUSbxjLVFmKj.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"As its name indicates, its strongest selling point is the fact that this keyboard is illuminated. And we think the way Logitech lights it up is brilliant. Each key has a laser-etched character or symbol, which allows light from under the keys to shine up through that portion of the key. The emitted light reveals precisely what you need to see without being a distraction otherwise. The keyboard is equipped with ambient light sensors that automatically adjust the backlighting to the environmental lighting conditions. You also can manually adjust the backlighting to suit your individual preferences with the press of a button. Additionally, the K800 has an energy saving feature that turns the backlighting off and puts the keyboard to sleep after a few minutes of non-use. It also has a motion sensor, which wakes it up again when your hands return to the keyboard. Although some users complain that it takes too long for the keyboard to wake up, we think a few seconds&#39; wait may be worth extending the life of the batteries in the long run.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/54148-logitech-illuminated-k80010.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9bae5ntWbJiUSbxjLVFmKj.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"9bae5ntWbJiUSbxjLVFmKj","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9bae5ntWbJiUSbxjLVFmKj.jpg","alt":""},"id":"9b38cc8f-4026-46d6-bdcf-2a460d6b4dc6","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Another very attractive feature of the K800 that earned it a spot among the 10 best wireless keyboards of 2012 is that you don’t have to go searching for batteries to keep this keyboard up and running. When the battery level indicator shows that the power supply is low, you just plug in the micro-USB cable for three to six hours to recharge the two AA NiMh batteries that are included with the keyboard. The keyboard will stay charged for about 10 days. The K800 also can be turned on and off with a switch located on the keyboard to conserve battery life and lengthen the time between charges, especially during longer periods of inactivity.","With the decision to use wireless peripherals comes the necessary consideration for reliable connectivity. The K800 works in conjunction with its own device-networking receiver, the Logitech Unifying receiver, and operates via 2.4 GHz RF connectivity, which ensures a wireless range of at least 30 feet with 128-bit AES encryption for secure information transfer. If you need a few more feet on your wireless range, the keyboard comes with a USB wireless extender as well. The tiny Unifying receiver plugs into an available USB port and makes it possible to network up to six compatible input devices on the same receiver, simplifying the performance of your peripherals and freeing up valuable USB ports on your PC or laptop. Seconds after you plug in the receiver, your keyboard is synced to the computer and you are ready to type.","Like other Logitech keyboards, the K800 gives you instant access to media and internet functions. You can use a combination of one of the F keys and the function key located at the bottom of the keyboard to access your email, calendar, calculator and media volume controls right from the keyboard. If you like, you can also customize the built-in F keys with Logitech&#39;s SetPoint software, which is available as a free download from their website. SetPoint is Logitech&#39;s champion for assigning new tasks to F-key functions, disabling keys you don&#39;t use, and facilitating the pairing of devices with the Unifying receiver."]},"id":"bce3f80a-470c-4314-8a76-b93d75a5caec","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"fec7fb29-9124-42d7-9a02-3492c429c9a4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/uoWcGudoazTNkK9SYWkZaW.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The full-size K800 keyboard makes the grade for good design with an ergonomic palm rest, light-touch keys, slim design and matte black finish.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/54148-logitech-illuminated-k8008.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uoWcGudoazTNkK9SYWkZaW.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"uoWcGudoazTNkK9SYWkZaW","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uoWcGudoazTNkK9SYWkZaW.jpg","alt":""},"id":"8d0c685b-e98c-4383-90d1-ad3cfcf90389","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This keyboard strives to make your hands happy with a built-in palm rest that mirrors the natural slope of your hands and reduces the possibility of repetitive strain injuries.
