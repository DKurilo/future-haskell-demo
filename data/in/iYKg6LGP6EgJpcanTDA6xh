If it had more clip art options, greater importing capabilities and a wider variety of sharing methods, PhotoOne would compare better with similar products. Although it is more basic than others on some levels, this software will meet your basic digital scrapbooking needs.","There are 40 different file formats that can be imported into PhotoOne Print. This is an impressive number, but you can’t import images directly from a scanner. Most people will need to convert traditional photos to digital using a scanner, so the exclusion of this importing feature makes the software less convenient.","The program provides users with a few basic editing features such as adding shape effects, adjusting image color and exposure, removing red-eye and playing around with image effects – posterize, mosaic, blur, sharpen, add noise, etc. You can also use the software to rotate, flip and crop photos. You also have the choice of creating your own simple layouts from scratch using a variety of backgrounds.","PhotoOne Print allows you to save your completed project as a JPG or print it directly from the interface, which limits your sharing options. You will be able to print from home, but this software doesn’t integrate with third-party print services like Shutterfly or Snapfish. If you have a good printer at home this may not be a problem, but it limits your options. This software also lacks the ability to create video slideshows as some of the better products in our lineup will allow you to do. If you want to send a page to a friend, you will have to send it as a PDF, since that is the only format this software lets you export. So your overall sharing options are limited.","Its interface is not as elegant or intuitive as comparable products, but once you find your way around, the software is easy to use. The tools, settings and templates lack the functionality of higher-ranked products. The limited exporting and publishing options can be frustrating. Another downside is that many of the images and backgrounds in this software feel dated. But there are plenty of options and you also have the choice of creating your own simple layouts from scratch using a variety backgrounds the software provides.","Best IT Solutions offers help for PhotoOne through its online Quick Start Guide and email support. There’s also a help section with a content search and index section built directly into the software, which offers brief but adequate instructions.","PhotoOne Print by Best IT Solutions is a solid product with a lot of potential, but its limited clip art selection, the uninviting opening screen and the labor-intensive process of importing images from a scanner were definite drawbacks. Without improvements in these areas, PhotoOne is only a featherweight compared to the powerful contenders of digital scrapbooking. Some of the templates also feel dated, but there are enough choices that you can combine elements to create a design that fits your style. You can also create your own simple layouts from scratch using a variety of backgrounds. Though there aren’t a lot of extras with this software, it is a valid choice for someone who wants to keep scrapbook creation easy."]},"id":"6036c397-4316-4f3e-b77e-85c855650937","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1044","url":"/photoone-print-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-07-06T22:11:35Z","name":"PhotoOne Print 1.5","synopsis":"PhotoOne Print is quality digital scrapbooking software, but it lacks an inviting interface and some useful features.
