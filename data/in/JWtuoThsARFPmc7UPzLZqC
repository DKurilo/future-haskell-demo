You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Large families require large kitchen ranges like our Top Ten Reviews Bronze Award winner, the Frigidaire FGEF3055MF. The large oven, versatile cooktop and special features make this <a href=\"/best-electric-cooktop-ranges\">electric range</a> a good fit for families of all culinary experience levels. On the electric stovetop, there are three standard burners in the back and two expandable elements in the front. The two front elements measure 6 to 9 inches and 9 to 12 inches wide. Both of these elements are wide enough to fit large pots and pans comfortably.","The remaining burners produce less power and heat slowly. The rear center element is slightly larger with a lower wattage for simmering and warming foods. The powerful expandable burners make up for the low maximum wattage. This electric range may be a good fit if you&#39;re willing to sacrifice smaller burners for quick-heating expandable elements.","The 6.0 cubic foot oven is large enough to bake a Thanksgiving turkey and trimmings. The bake and broil elements are relatively close in wattage, but still heat quickly. The baking element produces up to 3,500 watts while the broiler element produces up to 3,900 watts. When cooking multiple dishes with the oven, you can adjust the two racks with the seven rack guides to fit multiple large dishes.","This oven lacks the more modern steam clean cycle but has a self-cleaning cycle that produces high temperatures and reduces food soils to dust. Depending on the level of mess inside your oven, the heat cycle can take two to four hours to complete. This feature is powerful, but you want to be aware of any children or pets in the house when the cycle runs. Despite its lack of steam clean, this Frigidaire model has some extra conveniences we looked for in an electric range.","Frozen and fresh pizza isn&#39;t particularly hard to make, but setting the oven is one extra step between you and delicious pizza. This may seem like a silly feature to have, but the Frigidaire FGEF3055 has a pizza button that allows you to adjust time and temperature for frozen or fresh pizza. This shortcut is a major breakthrough for large families in need of a quick meal.","In addition to perfect pizza, this Frigidaire range has an internal probe that displays the internal temperature of your food. This tool is best for roasts, hams and poultry, and it checks the internal temperature to make sure the food is safely and properly prepared. When set correctly, the electric range alerts you when the food reaches its target temperature. When active, the probe displays the internal temperature. Just don’t forget to remove the probe during a self-clean cycle. It can’t withstand the high temperatures without warping or melting."]},"id":"8aaca9c5-a1a7-4d67-8d1d-5a5eb1843228","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b3a23509-791f-48ec-83bf-50bb66221d90","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There aren&#39;t many extra features included on the Frigidaire FGEF3055, but the ones available are very useful.
