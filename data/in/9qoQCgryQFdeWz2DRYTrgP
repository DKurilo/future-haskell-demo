Dealerships are usually more reputable than any third-party seller who you should vet very carefully. In both instances we advise you to check your existing auto insurance, as some form of mechanical breakdown insurance might be included in your policy – meaning this is may be an unnecessary expense.

In fact, the only reason I use these terms is they are what people often search for when looking for additional coverage for their vehicle. In addition, the services use these terms frequently for the same reason. But it’s not accurate.","<u>What Is a Car Warranty?</u><br/>A car warranty can only be offered and administered by the manufacturer for new cars, and it is included in the price of the vehicle.","<u>What Is an Extended Car Warranty?</u><br/>An extended car warranty is only offered by new-car dealerships to make the manufacturer’s warranty more comprehensive or to extend the terms of the manufacturer’s warranty, often to sweeten the deal. However, even these are not warranties. Rather, they are service contracts administered by a third-party service partnered with the dealership, not the manufacturer.","<u>What Is a Vehicle Service Contract?</u><br/>A vehicle service contract has a similar purpose to a manufacturer’s warranty but is sold independently by a third-party administrator or broker. The advantage of a vehicle service contract is you can buy one at any time for any vehicle, new or used.","<u>So Why the Confusion?</u><br/>Unfortunately, some services in the vehicle protection industry prey on this confusion. I explain these issues in greater detail later in this article, but some services contact consumers under the pretense of representing manufacturers or dealerships. These predatory services scare consumers by saying their car’s warranty has expired or is about to expire. As a result, many people are tricked into buying vehicle service contracts from third-party administrators they’ve never heard of. And this has become such a big problem, the FCC and BBB have webpages devoted to making complaints.","To be clear though, while some of the services I reviewed can be very aggressive in their sales approach once you’ve submitted a quote, none of them have been involved in those deceptive marketing tactics, as far as I’m aware.

I used multiple vehicles of varying age, mileage and model to gauge each part of this process.","<strong>Quoting Process</strong><br/>Every service customizes the price and coverage terms of their plans according to the vehicle&#39;s specific history. This means they don&#39;t have a standard cost for each plan. The same plan costs significantly different for a sedan with 140,000 miles and a minivan with 50,000 miles.","To find out what coverage your vehicle is approved for and how much it costs, you enter the year, make, model, mileage and your personal information into the service&#39;s quote form. What happens next varies greatly. In most cases, your information is given to a salesperson. Either way, getting the information necessary to make a purchasing decision is not as easy as it seems like it should be. The sales people are aggressive and most refuse to provide a quote without having a conversation first. In a few cases, the sales contact put an expiration date on the quote. With two services, it took nearly a week to get the quotes I needed. Some services have very aggressive salespeople who called me repeatedly every day, even after providing a quote.","It&#39;s difficult to compare pricing because the quotes varied significantly, in terms of miles covered and cost. Some plans covered just 12,000 miles but were very affordable. Other plans for the same vehicle covered 100,000 miles but were very expensive. To find an appropriate comparison, I calculated the price per mile covered for each quote I received. For example, if a car received a quote for a 100,000-mile plan at $4,000, the cost per mile is about $0.04. I did this with multiple vehicles to find an average cost per mile covered for each service.  ","<strong>Coverage Options</strong><br/>Just getting approved for coverage is a challenge. Every service has restrictions for how old and how many miles a vehicle can have to be eligible. However, you have the best chance of finding the coverage you need with services with many plans available and a good mileage restriction. For example, Autopom sells 21 service contracts and covers any vehicle with under 225,000 miles, so you have a better chance of finding a plan to fit your needs. ","<strong>Contracts</strong><br/>You should carefully read any contract you sign, but this goes double for vehicle service contracts, as it makes all the difference in determining whether your repairs are covered or denied. The contracts stipulate what your responsibilities are, what records you need to keep and what type of maintenance is required to receive coverage. There is also a lot of language allowing them to deny coverage for a wide variety of issues. You need to understand the risks before you sign.","I read contracts from each service – 130 pages of legalese in total. In this process, I evaluated the average words per page, the font size, formatting and overall clarity. Legalese is not easy to read in the best of circumstances, but the best contracts aren&#39;t too long, don&#39;t fit more than 600 words on each page and make clear delineations between sections. The worst contracts averaged 1,200 words or more per page with excessive bolding and a lack of logical formatting. These contracts were difficult to follow."]},"id":"9c0a615e-60d5-4b70-bec9-d8a21fb91c46","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Vehicle Service Contracts: What You Need to Know"},"id":"b50ac379-d32c-4f4f-866e-dc4aef2cd041","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Just because you spent $3,000 on an extended warranty doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re going to get your repairs paid for when a breakdown occurs. Similar to insurance companies, these services have to approve or deny the repairs before the mechanic can get you back on the road. And if you don&#39;t pay close attention to the contract, you&#39;re putting yourself at risk. In an article published by <a href=\"https://www.realsimple.com/work-life/money/vehicle-service-contract\">Real Simple</a>, an investigator for the Better Business Bureau said, &#34;Sellers often cite loopholes in the contract (ones you would never be able to discern) to avoid paying up.&#34;","Here are some tips for what you should look for in the contracts and other considerations before buying an extended warranty.","<strong>Is a Vehicle Service Contract Worth It?</strong>","Clark Howard, a consumer expert who specializes in financial advice and tips, says studies have shown most people who have purchased an extended warranty never use it and the ones who do typically pay more for the warranty than the repairs would cost. He doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it. Instead, he recommends putting the money you would have paid each month on a vehicle service contract into a savings account. So, if a plan costs $3,000 over two years, then you&#39;d put $125 into a savings account each month. This way, you have money set aside for repairs and if your car doesn&#39;t need repairs, you have money set aside for the down payment on a new car. This method ensures your money doesn&#39;t go to waste. That said, it won&#39;t cover expensive repairs early on, before you&#39;ve saved much.","These plans do come with additional services, and this adds value to the contract. Every contract has 24-hour roadside assistance and reimbursement for vehicle rentals while your car is in the shop. You can get reimbursed for towing, rental vehicles and hotel rooms. If your car breaks down 100 miles from your destination, you can get reimbursed for hotel rooms.","<strong><strong>Understanding BBB Grades</strong></strong>","Extended car warranty services often emphasize their A+ grade with the Better Business Bureau. Not only are the grades shown prominently throughout their websites, but the representatives I contacted often pointed to their A+ BBB grade as a reason why they’re the best choice. And it makes sense - who doesn’t love to brag about an A+ grade?","However, it’s important to understand what a <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/overview-of-bbb-ratings\">BBB grade</a> is and what it isn’t, especially in an industry so notorious for low customer satisfaction, the BBB has a page devoted to filing <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/autoline\">auto warranty complaints</a>.","<u>What the BBB Grade Isn’t</u><br/>Consumers often confuse the BBB as being a government agency, which is only compounded with how the Yellow Pages often lists local BBB offices under government agencies. This leads many to conflate an A+ grade from the BBB as the equivalent to an A+ certification from the health department.  ","As Brad Tuttle points out in <a href=\"http://business.time.com/2013/03/19/why-the-better-business-bureau-should-give-itself-a-bad-grade/\">“Why the Better Business Bureau Should Give Itself a Bad Grade,”</a> the BBB has 113 independently operated affiliate offices across North America. Their customers are the businesses, not consumers or taxpayers. And Tuttle argues, “there’s a natural incentive to paint its paying clients in the best possible light.” The BBB’s spokesperson even states the grades are not an evaluation of the companies&#39; quality of service or quality of product.","<u>What the BBB Grade Is</u><br/>In Tuttle’s article, the BBB’s grades are nothing more than a company’s “good faith effort to resolve complaints.” This is all. The grade represents the company’s response to complaints lodged against it. And even though the BBB rating elements suggest otherwise, it doesn’t matter how many complaints a company receives, if they follow the BBB’s rules for responding to the complaints, it still receives a high grade. So, a company with thousands of complaints can receive a higher grade than a company with few complaints, as shown in Tuttle’s article.","So, all an A+ grade from the BBB reflects is how well the extended warranty service is at responding to complaints according to the BBB guidelines.","<strong>Does AAA Offer Extended Auto Warranties?</strong>","AAA offers many benefits to drivers, but it doesn’t sell extended auto warranties. However, AAA provides benefits similar to what is included in an extended car warranty. For many, membership could be the better option. ","With 58 million members, AAA is the most widely used roadside service in North America, and for good reason - membership covers you with emergency road services everywhere you go, at all times of the day, regardless of the vehicle you’re driving. You could be in your friend’s car when the tire blows, and your AAA membership will cover the towing or flat tire repair. It also includes locksmith service for when you lock your keys in your car, emergency fuel delivery and battery service.","Similar roadside assistance is included in the contracts of all the extended car warranty services we reviewed, but the stipulations of the emergency assistance applies only to the vehicle the extended warranty covers, and the contracts often only stipulate what is reimbursed. This means you have to pay for the service and go through a reimbursement process.","AAA also helps lower repair costs, though not to the same degree as a vehicle service contract. AAA members who take their vehicles to a AAA-approved shop get a 10-percent discount on repairs, and the repairs are backed with a 24-month and 24,000-mile guarantee. With vehicle service contracts, you typically either pay nothing on repairs or only have a $100 co-pay. However, vehicle service contracts can easily deny your repair claims because of how some contracts are structured in favor of the services, but AAA’s discount doesn’t have the same risk. Your repair discount can’t be denied, for example, because you failed to keep receipts from every oil change.   ","<strong>Your Responsibilities: Is This for You?</strong>","The biggest pitfall to getting repairs approved is failing to pay close attention to the driver responsibility section of the contract. Every contract has a &#34;driver responsibility&#34; section outlining what you need to do to receive coverage. The most important of these clauses is following your vehicle&#39;s owner manual&#39;s instructions for proper operation and maintenance schedule. You must have the vehicle maintained in accordance to the mileage specifications and you must keep receipts and other records of the maintenance. Some contracts even specify what type of receipts are unacceptable and not admissible as proof of maintenance, such as handwritten receipts.","If you&#39;re not the type of driver to pay close attention to your tire pressure, oil and fluid levels, mileage and scheduled maintenance, then a vehicle service contract is not for you. You must know the details of your owner&#39;s manual and records. Otherwise, your contract is meaningless.","<strong>Clauses to Consider Carefully</strong>","Every contract is loaded with clauses you need to read carefully before you sign. However, some clauses are common in all the contracts I read, and they either leave too much interpretation to the service or require special attention from you, as the driver. Here are some clauses to consider:","<u>Taxi Service &amp; Other Commercial Uses</u><br/>Contracts won&#39;t approve repairs if you use your vehicle for commercial purposes. In most of the stipulations, such as using your vehicle as an emergency transport vehicle, it&#39;s a reasonable exclusion. However, this includes taxi service – you can&#39;t drive for Uber, Lyft or other drive-sharing taxi apps, even if your car breaks down when you&#39;re not driving to supplement your income. If you do, you risk voiding the contract.    ","<u>Mechanical Breakdowns Caused by Common Elements</u><br/>Parts break, in large part, because of the elements they are exposed to – heat, moisture, salt, vibrations and more. By including these causes in the exclusionary section of a contract, a service can deny nearly any repair. It doesn’t matter if you maintained the strict maintenance schedule and kept all your reports; if a part failed because an unseen bolt rusted out, your repair is denied.","<u>Breakdown Caused by a Failure in Nuts, Bolts or Fasteners</u><br/>Speaking of bolts, your repairs are denied if the cause of the failure is deemed to be the result of a bad nut, bolt or fastener. These seemingly minor components do wear out regularly and can cause components to break down or wear out faster than usual, even if you adhere to a strict maintenance schedule and proper driving techniques.","<u>Failure to Observe Warnings</u><em> </em><br/>The service can deny repairs if they believe you failed to properly observe early warning signs. This is a significant loophole because every mechanical failure could be argued to have some early warning signs. While some warning signs are obvious, such as an engine warning light or gauges, most warning signs are not obvious to most drivers. You may not realize your vehicle is leaking fluids unless you&#39;re looking for it. You may not know how to identify bad sounds in an engine or the ominous vibrations from bad wheel bearings. These are all listed in the clauses, and yet the contracts often state something along the lines of: &#34;Lack of mechanical knowledge is not an excuse.&#34;","<u>Failure to Have Your Vehicle Towed</u><br/>This is a reasonable exclusion, as you should stop driving a vehicle if it breaks down to avoid further damage. However, it&#39;s far too easy to assume you can continue driving to a mechanic. For example, many years ago, I had an alternator go out on my car. I was 20 miles outside of Las Vegas. The car was still operating, albeit just barely able to reach 15 mph. I rolled into the city and found a mechanic. If I had a vehicle service contract, the repair would likely have been denied. The moment you know something is wrong, you need to stop driving and call a tow truck. Fortunately, these contracts all reimburse towing costs, usually up to $50.","The potential red flag in this exclusionary clause is the point at which you decided to stop driving to call a tow truck. If they determine you should have stopped sooner, they can deny your repair.","<u>Pre-Existing Issues &amp; Wait Period</u><br/>Every contract has a wait period before the coverage takes effect. Typically, this period is 1,000 miles or 30 days. This period makes sure you&#39;re not buying coverage because you know something is wrong. However, if a component breaks down at any time after this period, they still have the right to determine if the issue started before coverage. For example, if the wheel bearings go out on day 31, they are likely to deny coverage because wheel bearings typically start showing symptoms of wearing out weeks to months prior to seeing a mechanic. And remember, ignorance of mechanic issues is not an excuse.","<strong>How to Find Your Vehicle’s Recommended Maintenance Specifications?</strong>","If you’re going to purchase a vehicle service contract, you need to become familiar with your vehicle’s owner&#39;s manual. Since every extended car warranty service can deny repairs if you fail to prove you’ve followed the vehicle’s specific maintenance requirements, found in the owner’s manual, it’s critical to know what is expected for your vehicle. Every car is different, so you can’t rely on following common maintenance recommendations and expect your vehicle service contract administrators to approve your repairs.   ","Now, if you’re wondering where your owner’s manual is, you’re not alone. Most used cars aren’t going to have the manual in the glovebox. And even many new cars don’t include owner’s manuals. As such, you need to find the manual online, download the file and become intimately familiar with the maintenance schedule.","Fortunately, automobile manufacturers provide owner’s manuals on their websites. You simply have to enter the car’s year, make and model. In a few cases you may have to create a log-in to download the manual and you may have to provide the VIN of your vehicle, the vehicle identification number typically found on the dash near the windshield on the driver’s side.","However, most auto manufacturers don’t include a full library of owner’s manuals, choosing only to list the most recent vehicles. For example, Infiniti only provides access to manuals for vehicles made after 2009. If you can’t find your vehicle’s manual, there are some archive websites worth checking out to see if it’s available:"]},"id":"7c353d4e-3fd4-468f-92c0-353b3f77e40f","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://justgivemethedamnmanual.com/\">Just Give Me the Damn Manual</a>","<a href=\"https://diyrepairmanuals.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiujZtcv13gIVT1mGCh3GwwhREAAYASAAEgJ6EfD_BwE\">DIY Repair Manuals</a>","<a href=\"https://repairpal.com/automobile-owners-manuals-online\">Repair Pal</a>","<a href=\"http://auto.manualsonline.com/\">Automotive Manuals</a>","<a href=\"https://www.freeautomechanic.com/free-car-owners-manual.html\">Free Auto Mechanic</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"6111c7e8-1f4c-455d-8fd0-e7d2f3ce009c","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Am I Using the Right Gasoline?</strong>","All gasoline comes from the same refined crude oil, but each oil company fine-tunes its recipes with various additives, though each has to meet the EPA minimum for detergent requirements to maintain a cleaner burning engine. This is because gasoline leaves behind deposits that can cause engine problems to develop over time, increase pollution, and lead to a less efficient, rougher-driving vehicle. Most oil companies have three tiers of gasoline, with the higher tiers having more additives and detergents.","According to <a href=\"https://www.carfax.com/blog/top-tier-gas-medicine-engine\">Carfax</a>, many view these premium gasoline options as marketing fodder with no real benefit. But this isn’t true. Many manufacturers design engines engineered specifically to use premium gasolines with a higher mixture of detergents. In other words, these engines aren’t designed to handle the deposits left behind by standard gasoline. In addition, multiple studies have suggested the premium gasolines make a difference, regardless of what vehicle uses them. Premium-tier gasolines result in 19 times fewer intake-valve deposits than non-premium gas and a 2- to 4-percent boost in fuel efficiency.","With concern to vehicle service contracts, using the wrong kind of gasoline could result in a rejected repair. Since every contract specifies you must follow your owner’s manual maintenance and usage guidelines, if your car&#39;s manual recommends premium gas, you need to be pay extra each time you fill up or risk having an expensive repair rejected. In case you can’t find the owner’s manual, the gasoline recommendation is often printed on or near the gas cap.","<strong>Reasons Your Claim Is Denied</strong>","One of the biggest complaints people have about their vehicle service contracts is how easily repair claims can be denied by the administrator. Just imagine how deflating it feels to learn your transmission is blown and the extended warranty you purchased for $2,500 won’t pay for it. This is why it’s imperative to read the contract carefully before committing to the service.","So, here are some tips to ensure your repair claim isn&#39;t denied, according to <a href=\"https://www.endurancewarranty.com/learning-center/extended-warranty/extended-auto-warranty-claim-denied/\">Endurance</a>:","<u>Keep Track of Your Records:</u> You have to keep a detailed record of everything related to your car – the repairs, maintenance, oil changes, filter changes, etc. Keep the receipts. These are proof that you adhered to the car’s required maintenance.","<u>Don’t Skip Required Maintenance:</u> Every car has a maintenance schedule defined in the owner&#39;s manual by the manufacturer. And every vehicle service contract has clauses requiring you to follow that maintenance schedule. If you file a claim and the service asks to see the records and you missed one of the recommended maintenance points, your repair will be denied. The administrators of these vehicle service contracts view missed maintenance as neglect and a possible reason for a breakdown.","<u>Don’t Modify Your Car:</u> Every vehicle service contract prohibits vehicle modifications. Endurance suggests that some small interior and exterior modifications can be approved by the administrator if they’re cosmetic, but you should make sure you get them approved first. However, any modifications meant to help your car run faster, better or more efficiently, even if required by law, are not permitted.   ","<strong>How Do I Know If My Mechanic is Ripping Me Off?</strong>","Most mechanics aren’t out to fleece you. Their goal is to gain your trust so you’ll return to their shop for your car needs. However, this doesn’t mean that there aren’t some dishonest mechanics out there. It also doesn’t make it less stressful when your mechanic approaches you with the need to replace the wheel bearings to the tune of $1,200 per wheel.   ","The easiest way to avoid being scammed is to ask the mechanic to explain why you need the repair and to show you the issue. This often exposes their intent, especially if they refuse to take you into the shop to show you why your car needs the repair.","According to Aaron Miller from the <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/cars/8-ways-your-mechanic-is-ripping-you-off-how-to-avoid-car-repair-scams-and-schemes\">Thrillist</a>, you should also be suspicious if the mechanic:"]},"id":"5185cb75-06c6-4709-b7ca-1b080d4e349b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<u>Urges you to replace the the brake rotors</u>: If the rotors have never been serviced, ask them to “turn the rotors” on a lathe instead.

And unfortunately, the auto warranty robocalling scam is one of the most common.","The call starts with a warning about how your car’s warranty has expired or is about to expire. The scam is effective because the scripts are worded subtly to make it seem like the call is coming from a car dealership or manufacturer. If it catches your attention, you’re forwarded to an aggressive telemarketer from an extended car warranty service that has no relationship with your dealership or car manufacturer.","The vehicle service contracts the telemarketers sell are real. The scam isn’t typically about getting financial or personal information – it is more about the deceptive tactics used to get you to talk to an extended car warranty salesperson.

The best way to avoid one of these scams is to never purchase an extended car warranty over the phone. Submitting a quote gives these services permission to use automated dialing systems to contact you, and many include clauses allowing them to share your information. If you receive a call, simply request the quote be sent to you in an email and make sure you can purchase the contract through a secure online connection. An email allows you to carefully review your purchase, who is selling it, who is administering it, and exactly what the contract does and does not cover.","<strong><strong>Tips for Spring Car Maintenance: De-Winterizing</strong></strong>","Routine seasonal maintenance is necessary if you want the best performance from your car.

A broker doesn’t have any role in approving, denying, paying or processing repairs.","<u>Bumper-to-Bumper Coverage:</u> Also referred to as exclusionary coverage, a bumper-to-bumper contract covers most parts of your car. In most cases, manufacturers only provide powertrain warranties to new vehicles, so this is ideal for new vehicles.","<u>Deductible:</u> This is the amount you are required to pay before the administrator pays the rest of the bill. Almost every vehicle service contract requires a $100 deductible or a percentage deductible where you pay a percentage of the repair bill.","<u>Exclusionary Coverage:</u> Also referred to as bumper-to-bumper coverage, an exclusionary contract is so comprehensive it’s easier to list what is excluded from coverage than what is covered. These contracts are made specifically for new vehicles with low mileage. In most cases, manufacturer warranties only provide powertrain warranties, covering the most expensive and critical parts of the vehicle. An exclusionary coverage contract is designed to expand the coverage for newer vehicles, which is why these contracts are not typically eligible for used cars or high-mileage cars.","<u>Extended Warranty:</u> We’ve referenced this several times throughout this article, but an extended warranty is another term for vehicle service contract. In fact, it’s a misnomer often used in marketing for vehicle service contracts. A warranty can only be offered by the manufacturer, by definition. And manufacturers don’t extend warranties past the original date. Rather, a vehicle service contract is meant to serve a similar purpose by providing protection against breakdowns.","<u>Gray Market Vehicle:</u> This is a vehicle not manufactured for sale in the U.S. It often means they don’t meet U.S. regulations.

The coverage can vary a bit, but it typically covers the most expensive parts to repair – engine, transmission, drive shafts, differentials.","<u>Trip Interruption Benefits:</u> This is part of a vehicle service contract defining the reimbursements for breakdowns when you are more than 100 miles from your destination. Typically, it covers one to three nights in a hotel at a specific rate per day. Some contracts also cover meals.","<u>Vehicle Identification Number:</u> This is a number specific to your vehicle. Many vehicle service contract providers require the VIN to provide an accurate quote because this tells them the history of the vehicle. You can typically find your vehicle’s VIN on the dashboard near the windshield on the driver’s side.","<u>Vehicle Service Contract:</u> This is correct term for an extended car warranty. It’s a contract between you and an administrator to pay or help pay for repairs to your vehicle. The manufacturer of your vehicle has no part in this contract.","<u>Warranty:</u> This is a promise of performance provided by the manufacturer of a vehicle. While the vehicle is under the warranty, specifics parts covered in the warranty are repaired by the manufacturer at no cost.","<u>Wear and Tear:</u> This one of the most common phrases in a vehicle service contract, particularly when describing repairs not covered under the contract. It refers to issues resulting from everyday use of the car.

However, in most cases, banks and financial institutions don’t require this. It’s certainly not required by law.","The deception usually works by adding the sale of the contract into the purchase contract, often as a box you check, agreeing to the contract. For example, let’s say you want to buy a car for $10,000, but you need financing. As you fill out the paperwork in the salesman’s office, he’ll casually mention how you’ll need to add a vehicle service contract for the bank to approve the loan. He usually doesn’t disclose how much the vehicle service contract costs and only vaguely describes what it is.","Once the salesman returns with the good news of the approved loan, he tells you the monthly payment and the interest rate, but not that the vehicle service contract added several thousand dollars to the overall loan amount.  So, rather than applying for a $10,000 loan, he got you approved for a $14,000 loan. And as long as you don’t shudder at the monthly payment, he won’t disclose the loan amount until the very end when you’re ready to sign the contract, take the keys and go for a ride in your new car. He knows you’re eager to leave in your new car, which is why he waits until the very end to breakdown the overall contract - $10,000 for the car, $1,000 for taxes and $3,000 for the vehicle service contract.","If an auto dealer tries to slip a vehicle service contract past you, make sure you contact the bank issuing the loan to confirm whether it’s required. In most cases, only full-coverage insurance is required. Many auto dealerships have partnerships with vehicle service contract administrators, and the salesperson gets a commission from each contract sold, so it’s not in their interest to be transparent, but they can remove it from the contract.
