You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The GE Perfect Image does not have high definition video, so it really cannot compete with other <a href=\"/best-webcams\">webcams</a> we looked at, but there are some nice features here. This unit might be the right fit for someone who is looking for something basic, including people who do not use their webcams every day.","This webcam stands out in a couple of ways. First, it offers a unique compact design that makes it easy to take it with you if you travel often. The base unfolds to clip onto your computer monitor and provides a decent fit. You won&#39;t want to fit it onto any Mac machine, though. It is only compatible with PCs.","Secondly, it is lacking resolution, and not just in the video category we mentioned earlier. The highest resolution for still pictures is 1.3 megapixels. You will still get a perfectly adequate picture for some things at that resolution, but we saw numbers that are more impressive for other webcams in a similar price range.","The GE Perfect Image webcam comes with a built-in microphone that doesn’t echo or add static while you talk. We like that.","The GE Perfect Image is very easy to install and use. You simply load the CD to install the software, plug in the webcam and the most difficult part is complete. Although it has auto-focus, there is an adjustable focus ring if you would like to focus it manually.","The web camera will connect to any USB 2.0 port through a cable that comes with it. The USB connectivity makes the camera easy to use on multiple computers and in multiple places.","Help and support for General Electric webcams is provided through the Jasco Products website. They offer a two-year manufacturer&#39;s warranty. We sent an email and got a response from Jasco within 48 hours. We also received fast and friendly responses from Jasco over the phone."]},"id":"a636a5bd-4b28-4226-831c-b9c09babf7a3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3bc194bc-d5c5-4f32-960c-f09719432f01","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the GE Perfect Image Webcam is a decent product.
