Granted, they don&#39;t often have the greatest range of functionality, but if you&#39;re looking for a cheap and straightforward copter, Syma is a great go-to. The company&#39;s X3 quadcopter is on the higher end of their lineup, offering nice benefits like 2.4GHz transmission and integrated rotor guards. Unfortunately, the drone&#39;s learning curve is slightly steeper than Syma&#39;s classic RC helicopters, so expect to spend two or three flights getting used to its movement.","Much of that learning curve is endemic to quadcopters: It can often be difficult to tell which direction a smaller drone is facing. Where it might be easy to recognize the front of the best RC helicopters, you often have to go by color alone on a drone â€“ different hull colors or propeller colors on the front and back of the flier. Neither is an option on the X3, since there&#39;s no color differentiation or colored LEDs to show you which direction is forward.","Granted, you can always tell which way the X3&#39;s facing by actively moving it forward. As is the case with many of our RC helicopter reviews, Syma&#39;s quadcopter is wonderfully nimble. Its ability to sideslip left and right is a welcome change from 3.5-channel, budget helicopters, letting it slip in any of the six primary directions with equal ease. However, it&#39;s very slow to turn on its central axis. This actually makes it easier to fly without turning, since you can fundamentally go anywhere without using the rudder.","Should you lose track of the drone to the point that you crash, Syma&#39;s got your back. Along with plastic rotor guards that do a decent job of keeping the rotor blades from directly hitting walls, the X3 also offers a technology unique to Syma helicopters: double circuit protection. This is, essentially, a special circuit in the helicopter that automatically cuts power to its motors if they can&#39;t spin freely, preventing burnout."]},"id":"3e10d2f1-752d-4c9d-8451-72779a80baa4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"54d3c7d0-0b33-4e5e-a258-42230c4b2781","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite the Syma X3&#39;s steep learning curve, its affordable price and ability to easily perform flips make it one of the best remote control helicopters you can buy.
