The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-garage-door-openers\">Garage Door Openers here</a>.</em>","As we work our way down the garage door opener lineup the systems lose more and more features – subtract 1/4 horsepower here, a second remote there – but the Chamberlain Power Drive PD212D with 1/2 horsepower still maintains a pretty good feature mix.","We like these good old-fashioned chain drives, especially this one because it has been taught some of the new tricks. For example, right out of the box it will integrate with your HomeLink equipment so you can control this garage door opener, along with lights inside your home, from a HomeLink button in your vehicle. This garage door opener can also boast a Good Housekeeping Seal of approval, which means they have thoroughly tested this garage door opener and can comfortably guarantee its soundness.","This opener can handle most double-wide doors typical in a residential setting – any door with an assisted weight of 500-600 pounds. Most folks do not know the weight of their door but the typical 1/2-horsepower garage door opener, including the Chamberlain Power Drive PD212D, can handle any door that you can open and close by hand with relative ease.","The Chamberlain garage door openers were all excellent in terms of safety and security, and this one was no exception. This garage door opener is poised to protect you and your family from intruders by offering a rolling code system so you never send the same code twice from your remote to the garage door opener. Criminals sometimes try to pry your garage door open in order to gain access to your home. This garage door opener is designed to keep the door closed when it is closed. You can also place this garage door opener in lock mode if you need to. That prevents access with any of your remote controls. That feature is very handy if you lose one of the remotes, even temporarily. You can still control the door from the main console if you need to.","This garage door opener comes with automatic reversal and beam systems. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission requires that modern garage door opener systems include a beam feature – a way to project a beam of light across the doorway – and this one complies. If the beam is interrupted by any object it will send that message to the garage door opener controls and the door will stop mid-close. The lights also automatically come on when the beam is broken. If the door touches any person or thing at any point during the closing process the door will stop and reverse.","This garage door opener does not include a keyless entry pad, which is a shame. We like that it comes with two remotes though. That at least limits the likelihood that you will need a keyless entry option because it is more difficult to lose two remotes than one. The lighted console is a nice feature too. If you install the console correctly, far out of the reach of children, it is easier than you might think to lose track of that big button in a dark garage. A lighted console makes sense.","Chamberlain support is solid and includes an organized website and good response times over the phone. Manuals and other product information are a cinch to find online."]},"id":"1538bbe2-4e7d-48b7-946b-d75d14016254","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b68fe1fe-b519-4031-89b7-1eadc0694374","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We’d prefer a little brighter light and a keyless entry option, but overall this is a solid unit among garage door openers.
