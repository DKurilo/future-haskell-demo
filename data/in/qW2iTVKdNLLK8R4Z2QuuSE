Silverlit&#39;s Enzo Ferrari has now taken the steps to change dependency on batteries and instead focuses on Bluetooth capabilities. It&#39;s a natural progression for electric RC cars. This Enzo Ferrari is packaged by itself and includes batteries for the car. The controls come as a free app for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. This vehicle is a scaled-down model of the limited-edition 12-cylinder Enzo Ferrari and is our TopTenREVIEWS Bronze Award winner for remote control cars.","The recommended ages for this remote controlled car are 8 years old and up. We found that both kids and adults could enjoy this car and find it easy to pick up and play with. You don&#39;t have to find the controller and extra batteries every time you want to take it for a 5-minute ride. That brings us to the battery life. Sadly, it isn&#39;t very impressive for a light sports car. You&#39;ll get an average of 10 minutes if you drive it non-stop. The car requires four AA batteries, and they are not rechargeable. The Ferrari allows for custom power and speed settings and can easily brake, reverse and turn on a dime. It&#39;s very fast, at just under 8mph.","Because of its licensed design, the Enzo Ferrari looks just like its large-scale counterpart. Everything from the tires to the visible engine is perfectly replicated. We are disappointed in the Enzo&#39;s durability. The body is plastic rather than metal, which would be helpful in crashes. Because it&#39;s an indoor car, crashing will happen a great deal. This vehicle gives you the extra features for design that many others try to simulate with stickers. The headlights, hazards and indicators can be turned on at any point and are very high quality.","The remote features are obviously the strength of this RC car. The app requires a quick download and an easy connection for the Bluetooth in your device&#39;s general settings. There are two settings for driving approaches. You have the option to use gesture control, where turning the device left or right controls steering, while tilting it forward revs the engine, and backwards will put on the brakes or reverse. The other steering option is more traditional as it displays two joysticks, one vertical, the other horizontal. Everything from the lights to the sound is controlled from your mobile device. In fact, the sound comes from the device rather than the car.","Silverlit offers a 60-day warranty. You can reach the company by phone and email for any technical questions or issues that arise with the Enzo Ferrari. An instruction manual comes with the car, and you can find a FAQs section on the Silverlit website it you have questions about connecting the device through Bluetooth."]},"id":"e929beb8-a678-4fa3-9b5d-ec0e8c1182a6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9a59ef3d-af22-4b95-a50b-fdf68b2f4411","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Enzo Ferrari by Silverlit stands out because of the pioneering replacement of battery-operated controls with an app for the iPod Touch, iPhone or iPad.
