The original review is below, but check out our current</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/mobile/accessories/best-bluetooth-car-kits/\">Bluetooth Car Kit Reviews</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Jabra DRIVE has one of the simplest and most intuitive designs for a Bluetooth car kit. It features a single speaker, a single omnidirectional microphone and only three buttons – two for volume control and one to activate voice commands. The simplicity of the design means that you&#39;ll spend more time with your eyes on the road, driving safely instead of searching for the right buttons. However, the simplicity also means that it lacks many features you&#39;d find in the best Bluetooth car kits.","The biggest flaw with the Jabra DRIVE is the call quality. It uses the narrowband frequency range of 150Hz to 3.4kHz, which is the standard for telephone calls. Since you only hear a fraction of the frequencies produced by the caller, the call quality sounds tinny and hollow, which leads to miscommunications. The best Bluetooth hands-free car kits utilize a wideband frequency response that expands the frequency range to encompass 50Hz to over 7kHz, which results in better communication because you hear a more realistic voice.","Another flaw with the Jabra DRIVE is the lack of an effective echo cancellation system. Without it, the microphone picks up the caller&#39;s voice, causing an echo to occur in the audio. The echoing becomes more prominent the louder the volume. Since the DRIVE only features one microphone, the noise cancellation system isn&#39;t great. While it&#39;s effective at reducing a small amount of background noise, it doesn&#39;t compare to Bluetooth car speakerphones with multiple microphones.","One of the best features of this affordable Bluetooth car kit is the advanced multipoint pairing capability. This feature allows you to pair two phones. For example, you can pair your work phone and your personal phone. If you&#39;re talking to a friend and you receive a call from a client, your friend will be put on hold while you take the second call on the other phone.","Another good feature is the voice commands, which include a text-to-speech and speech-to-text capability with the Jabra app. You can dictate texts and have it read incoming texts to you so that your attention never leaves the road."]},"id":"f7c48319-e95f-4a95-99e0-285e8bfe4539","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4d027de4-dd67-4dc4-b39a-3cfb3ed0d537","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Jabra DRIVE has a simple but intuitive design that features one microphone and one speaker.
