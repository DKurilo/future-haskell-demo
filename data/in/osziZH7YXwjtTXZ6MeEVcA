Whether your home suffered damage from internal flooding from a damaged pipe or external sources like a storm or a fire, water damage restoration and fire damage restoration may be necessary and are typically covered by your homeowner&#39;s insurance. You may be required to assess multiple quotes from a more than one restoration service. There are many nationally based services that are on call seven days a week, including holidays, to help stem the damage in your home before it spreads and makes matters even worse.","Many services minimize secondary damage from flooding and fire by performing tasks like document restoration, mold remediation and mold removal, and more. All service providers give you a quote only after a team inspect the premises. Some services, like <a href=\"/money/small-business\">SERVPRO</a> and <a href=\"/money/small-business\">Stanley Steemer</a>, only provide water damage restoration while others, such as <a href=\"/money/small-business\">Restoration Management Company</a>, offer a full suite of damage repair services.","<strong>Restoration Damage and Cleanup Services: What to Look For</strong>","Recovering from a catastrophic event in your home requires immediate action and intervention. Most insurance providers ask for multiple quotes from different service providers. Hiring a service during a trying time can be stressful, so here are some guidelines to help you make your decision.","<strong>Service Area</strong><br/>While most restoration services are national, ensure that there is a service provider in your immediate vicinity to give you optimal service. A zip code locator or a service locator is typically found on the company&#39;s homepage or on a Contact Us page. The company may also have information regarding individual franchisee holders or service providers to help you make your decision.","<strong>Mold</strong><br/>Mold is an almost inevitable side effect of flood damage. Note that mold remediation and mold removal are quite different. If you home has suffered flooding, you may want to ensure that the team offers thorough mold remediation services. Mold removal typically refers to removing objects affected by mold, while remediation also address the repairing and removing the source of the mold itself. Ensure that not only your home is inspected but also your furniture, clothing, closets and any non-ventilated area where mold can flourish.","<strong>Damage to Household Goods</strong><br/>Many companies that offer fire damage recovery also can help revitalize documents and personal belongings. If a fire affected an office area, ensure that you also get a quote for document restoration. Make sure your provider includes drying out sofa cushions, mattresses and other high-end pieces of furniture in addition to drying walls, floors and crawl spaces.","<strong>Biohazard Cleanup</strong><br/>Flooding and fires can wreak havoc on areas surrounding your home. If you have a septic tank that was impacted by a flood, you may need to investigate a biohazard removal team. This could also be necessary for any workshops that had toxic solvents or paints, as well as businesses that could be leaking toxic materials into local water supplies. If you are remotely concerned that you may need this specialty, look for a service that can advise you on hazardous materials and can dispose of them safely and legally.","Unfortunately, accidents and emergencies are sometimes unavoidable. At those times, you need the security and reassurance of a reliable service. Fortunately, there are several national emergency restoration services that are equipped to help you and your home recover."]},"id":"76c3a4d2-a421-4cb2-8e35-77aacb8a3cfe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"69dc611b-feb5-4309-b048-50aa66b02552","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.belfor.com/en/us\">BELFOR</a>","<a href=\"http://www.coit.com/coupons\">COIT</a>","<a href=\"http://pauldavis.com/\">Paul Davis</a>","<a href=\"http://www.polygongroup.com/us/property-damage/\">Polygon</a>","<a href=\"http://www.puroclean.com/\">PuroClean</a>","<a href=\"http://rainbowintl.com/services\">Rainbow International</a>","<a href=\"http://rmc.com/contact/make-an-appointment-get-estimate/\">RMC</a>","<a href=\"http://www.servicemasterrestore.com/\">ServiceMaster Restore</a>","<a href=\"http://www.servpro.com/\">SERVPRO</a>","<a href=\"https://www.stanleysteemer.com/residential/water-damage-restoration\">Stanley Steemer</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"b3743758-7792-42fe-b925-a144dcd3c366","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1730","url":"/best-restoration-damage-and-cleanup-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-24T18:55:05Z","datePublished":"2015-09-23T20:47:10Z","name":"Restoration Damage and Cleanup Services Review","synopsis":"Restoration damage and cleanup services are a necessity when your property is damaged.
