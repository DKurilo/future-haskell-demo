Even though the company markets most of its gas trimmers to that audience, the Shindaiwa T235 works nicely for residential users as well. The T235 has a sound design and excellent technical support. This grass trimmer also supports a limited number of accessories.","This trimmer comes with a convenient pull-cord starter and lightweight structure that makes the machine easy to handle. At the core of the Shindaiwa T235 lies a 21.2 cc, two-cycle engine that is both powerful and lightweight, which enhances its handling. Its anti-vibration feature reduces shock to your muscles and stabilizes the trimmer during operation.","The fuel tank can hold 14.9 ounces of a gasoline and oil mixture, which is enough fuel to work for over an hour in most conditions. The two-cycle engine on this weed trimmer is a bit more difficult to use than a four-cycle engine, but it runs well. The only drawback to the engine design is that you need a mixed fuel for it to work properly.","One of the most impressive traits of the Shindaiwa T235 is its trimmer head. The trimmer head on this weed eater has a 20-inch cutting width, which is almost as large as that of lawn mowers. With such an enormous cutting path, the T235 can cover ground more quickly and efficiently. The trimmer head also comes with a debris shield and a bump line feeder. A bump feed allows you to tap the trimmer head on the ground to replace line that has worn away.","Shindaiwa made the T235 to work with several attachments, most of which are used for power sweeping, such as wire or nylon brushes. You can also convert this unit to a brush cutter, a hedge trimmer or a pole pruner if you need to clean up an overgrown property. If you want a greater selection of accessories, you will need to buy the Shindaiwa Multi-Tool or invest in a yard trimmer from a different brand.","Shindaiwa provides many technical support services to its customers, such as service centers, an online manual and direct telephone or email support. The best support feature Shindaiwa offers is its five-year warranty. The warranty is one of the best in our lineup. It even comes with a lifetime guarantee on the trimmer&#39;s driveshaft."]},"id":"a82a73b2-5909-4e65-adc0-d0db47173ecc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7c2466fb-1c73-4177-ad7d-559718abdc3a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Shindaiwa T235 weed whacker can handle even the most overgrown yards with its 20-inch cutting swath.
