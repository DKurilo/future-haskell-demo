In that time, we’ve considered dozens of applications, engaged in hands-on testing and ranked them accordingly. We tested each Blu-ray player program to determine the extent of its features, settings, functionality and ease of use. We evaluated the types of media discs and digital files they could process and the quality they produced. We looked for quality software that came with multiple types of customer support and was compatible with as many operating systems as possible.    ","<strong>How We Tested</strong><br/><br/>Performance Tests<br/>This grade is based on whether the software accommodates a variety of disc and digital file types without excessive drain on the central processing unit. We judged programs on their capacity to play the video without lag, buffering or any other distortions or delays. We also judged them on the amount and efficacy of audio and picture optimization settings.","Usability<br/>This grade reflects how easy the software was to use, its important features and settings, and how well it performs each task. Good player software should have an interface that is immediately easy to understand and navigate, causing no doubt or frustration in accessing features. We also judged customization options and other features, such as the modifiable video effects.","CPU Usage<br/>We played a test DVD and monitored our computer&#39;s CPU strain while running the software without any extra features or programs activated. The percentage shows the amount of processing power used while playing a movie in full screen. Higher percentages will mean that your computer may run slower if you are running multiple programs, or you may hear the computer fan running to keep the processor from overheating.  ","<strong>Further Information</strong>","It’s tempting to think that with the rise of streaming media and cloud storage for purchased movies and TV shows that things like DVDs and Blu-rays would soon be obsolete. However, in an <a href=\"https://www.twice.com/product/physical-media-isnt-going-anywhere-blu-ray-disc-association-dan-schinasi-victor-matsuda\">interview with <em>Twice</em></a>, <a href=\"https://us.blu-raydisc.com/\">Blu-ray Disc Association</a> representatives Dan Schinasi and Victor Matsuda paints a different picture. They noted that physical Ultra HD Blu-ray players sales were up 133%. And the association is going to be broadening its efforts to spread public understanding of Ultra HD Blu-ray technology.","With Blu-ray here for the long haul it’s important to understand a few things about what makes the best Blu-ray player software for your computer.","Video &amp; Audio: Quality Matters<br/>The best Blu-ray player software can read a variety of discs, not just Blu-ray. Look for one that can also play DVDs, CDs and rewritable discs. It should also be able to handle digital video and audio files such as AVI, MKV, MP4 and MP3.","This kind of software has convenient uses beyond playing Blu-ray movies. Some programs have the capacity to upscale standard-definition movies to high definition, or 2D movies up to 3D. However, if you choose to create a 3D movie, you&#39;ll still need compatible equipment to properly view it, including 3D glasses and a 3D-capable TV.","Blu-ray movies are meant to sound as good as they look. Good Blu-ray player software provides Dolby and Digital Theater System support and lossless audio playback, even when you use headphones or connect your computer to another device via HDMI cable. Additionally, the software should be able to fully handle all intended DVD capacities, including multi-language output for any DVD that offers it.","Controls &amp; Conveniences: Connect, Customize and Control<br/>Tweaking various settings in a video player system can pay off when you finally get to enjoy a perfect-looking video. Most software offers modifiable video effects, letting you adjust picture hue, saturation and brightness. It should also look good when you are navigating the player; a few software options let you customize the player skin, layout and background.","Movie player software is a must-have for Windows 8 and 10 users, since neither of them come with a free native media player. Some of the software applications we reviewed have Windows 8 touchscreen compatibility for the interface, blending seamlessly with your computer system and letting you watch all your favorite movies.","Some of the Blu-ray player software in our lineup has social media connectivity, so you can post status updates and comments via Facebook or Twitter about any video you&#39;re watching. Some programs work with the BD-Live network to access special features via the internet.","Because we all have so many different and constant uses for our computers, it&#39;s important that your media player doesn&#39;t drain your battery or dominate your CPU capacity while you use it. The best Blu-ray player software offers a power manager to help preserve your laptop battery life and reduce CPU consumption if you need to run other programs simultaneously.","Help &amp; Support: Don&#39;t Get Stuck, Get Help<br/>Software should not only perform its assigned functions well, but also provide you with optimal customer service should there be an issue. A good software manufacturer offers several means of technical support, whether it&#39;s direct contact with the support representatives via telephone or email, or self-help resources. The latter option encompasses, typically on the manufacturer&#39;s website, simple tutorials, a frequently-asked-questions section, and a knowledge base or a user forum where users of the software can communicate and help each other.","<strong>How Much Does Blu-ray Player Software Cost?</strong>","You can expect to pay anywhere between $30 and $80 for Blu-ray player software. This might seem very steep just to play discs on your computer, but considering all the additional features you get, it’s worth the price.","<strong>Best Free Blu-ray Player Software</strong>","<a href=\"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html\">VLC Media Player</a> is a free, open-source program that’s been around since 2001. It has adapted quite well to new audio and video formats as they’ve been developed and released. If you want a free Blu-ray player application, this is probably your best bet.","Figuring out how to use VLC to play Blu-rays takes a bit of research and involves manually inserting DLL files deep in your computer’s directory. You also have to create special folders, download obscure files from third-party websites and more.","This kind of virtual surgery on your computer has the potential to cause major problems if you don’t do it properly, and you run the risk of getting malware if you download the needed files from an untrustworthy source. And you never know if the instructions you’re getting from the internet are correct until you spend a good deal of time trying to get the software to work.","If you don’t know what you’re doing in this regard, it’s best to stick with paid programs."]},"id":"8db7817a-8503-4d9c-ae3a-95b151c9fafd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"a7109b21-fe76-4728-b05a-857dc4aee48e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/powerdvd-review\">Cyberlink PowerDVD 18</a>","<a href=\"/macgo-blu-ray-player-review\">Macgo Blu-ray Player 2.11</a>","<a href=\"/windvd-review\">WinDVD Pro 12</a>","<a href=\"/aurora-review\">Aurora Blu-ray Media Player</a>","<a href=\"/leawo-blu-ray-player-review\">Leawo Blu-ray Player 1.9.5</a>","<a href=\"/anymp4-review\">AnyMP4 Blu-ray Player 6.3.16</a>","<a href=\"/aiseesoft-blu-ray-player-review\">Aiseesoft Blu-ray Player</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"96f79b90-f925-4b79-95ab-c53ae9b6b40b","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_222","url":"/best-blu-ray-player-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
