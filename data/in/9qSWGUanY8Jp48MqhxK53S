After coming out of bankruptcy, you will face hurdles to obtaining an account that you would not have faced without a history of bankruptcy or bad credit. The good news is that in many cases, you can receive a merchant account with certain stipulations and conditions.","The first point to note about bankruptcy&#39;s effects on merchant-account applications is the timeline of your personal bankruptcy compared to your application. For example, if you&#39;re currently involved in bankruptcy proceedings or just coming out on the other side, don&#39;t bother to apply. You will most likely be rejected and should hold off for a while before applying. Check with companies that extend accounts to people with bad credit for an idea of how much time you should allow to pass before applying.","If you&#39;re far enough from your personal bankruptcy filing and have reestablished a credit history   and it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect credit   you may still need a business partner or relative with good credit to step in as a co-signer on your merchant-account application. For some processing companies, the guarantee of someone with good credit may be all that&#39;s needed to help your approval process. However, you cannot rely on a co-signer if you intend to open a business on our own in what&#39;s known as a sole proprietorship.","In addition to a co-signer, you may have to agree to a variety of stipulations on your account. For example, you may be required to accept what&#39;s called an automated clearing house or ACH delay. The ACH is the electronic network that connects financial institutions, and it&#39;s used to process all transfers of funds involved in credit, debit and other card transactions.<br/>When you have an ACH delay or hold put on your account, it means that the money from a card transaction goes into your account a little slower than it would if there were no ACH delay. This is a way for the account provider to control its risk in taking on an account from a person with a poor credit history. If you&#39;re required to agree to an ACH delay, ask if this condition can be lifted after a period of time.","Another effect of bankruptcy may be the stipulation that you accept a rolling reserve on your account. With a rolling reserve, your account provider sets aside a certain percentage of your total credit card processing transactions and holds this money for a specified period of time. With these funds held in reserve, the account provider has some protection if fraud is committed using your account.","Personal bankruptcy has become a more common problem in recent years, and as a result, there are more companies willing to extend merchant accounts to people with poor credit histories. Agreeing to fully disclose your financial history and accept ACH delays, rolling reserves and other conditions may be the best road to obtaining a merchant account for credit card processing for your new business."]},"id":"d0458dda-158e-4c64-a95c-91815ae193d8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7054","url":"/credit-card-processing-bankruptcy-effects-on-merchant-accounts","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-hicks","url":"/author/jennifer-hicks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Hicks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"m6DJLsYwJmcJdjxe4yY9kY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-03-13T18:41:05Z","datePublished":"2012-03-13T18:41:05Z","name":"Credit Card Processing: Bankruptcy Effects on Merchant Accounts","synopsis":"The effects of personal bankruptcy on merchant-account applications cannot be overstated.","review":{},"strapline":"The effects of personal bankruptcy on merchant-account applications cannot be overstated.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-09-15T16:34:45Z","id":"9qSWGUanY8Jp48MqhxK53S","meta":{"title":"Credit Card Processing: Bankruptcy Effects on Merchant Accounts","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
