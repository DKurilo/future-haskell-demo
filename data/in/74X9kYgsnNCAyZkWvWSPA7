The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/electronics/family/best-baby-sound-machines/\">Baby Sound Machines</a> here.</em>","The echo SOOTHE is an easy-to-use baby sound machine with a user-friendly interface and limited features. It has been classified as a “baby sound machine” as opposed to simply a “sound machine” because it includes child-specific sounds like heartbeat and lullaby. A one-year warranty is also included to guard against manufacturer defects.","With a market littered with baby sound machines that all provide similar sleep therapy options, features are what separate the great from the so-so products. Unfortunately, the Echo baby white noise machine is limited in the features department, thus classifying it as only so-so in our book. It doesn’t have an MP3 adapter for customizable music, a resume function or a night light.  We really like it when a baby sound machine includes an MP3 adapter because then as the child grows, the sound therapy music can be adjusted according to their needs. The biggest let down is the absence of a timer feature. We think that a timer is one of the most important features a baby noise machine should have. Without a timer the machine runs constantly, only shutting off when you remove the batteries or unplug the machine. With a timer, you could set the machine to run for 15, 30 or 45 minutes during naptime or to calm a fussy child during the day.","Shaped like a ski jump, the echo SOOTHE has all of the controls and the speaker directly on the front of the machine for easy access. Each sound has a correlating button, and when selected, the sound’s button will be slightly illuminated and the sound’s names will appear on the screen. The ideal travelling baby sound machine would be compact and flat and this sound machine has an awkward shape. However it&#39;s weight and portability may convince you otherwise. It only weighs approximately two pounds and can be powered via an AC adapter or by three AA batteries (which are included). In fact, we think its user-friendly interface and one-touch access is perfect for on-the-go moms.","As mentioned previously, the echo SOOTHE has sounds specific for soothing babies and toddlers. You can play recordings of a heartbeat inside of the womb to comfort your fussy newborn baby, serenade your toddler with familiar lullabies or soothe your older children with crashing ocean waves or a babbling brook. Some users express how much they enjoy listening to the sounds through the baby monitor, most of which put the parents to sleep as well!"]},"id":"618bec99-9ffe-4585-ad3c-3bb23cf5dfb0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1997b4ec-8590-4ea9-888f-16daee6b14dd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While we conclude that the <strong>echo SOOTHE</strong> isn’t the best baby sound machine on the market, it still does the job it was designed to do.

However, if you are looking for features that let the machine grow and develop with your child, like a night light and MP3 adapter, another sound machine may be a better fit."]},"id":"9355e1c0-9ebf-4ea8-bc29-41d001fa14f2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52313","url":"/echo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-03-07T18:51:14Z","datePublished":"2011-03-07T18:51:14Z","name":"echo SOOTHE ESX","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":61,"verdict":"This baby sound machine offers nothing more than sound therapy.","pros":["This machine is small and compact, making it a convenient travel companion."],"cons":["There is no timer option, causing the machine to run continuously."]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-03-07T18:51:14Z","id":"74X9kYgsnNCAyZkWvWSPA7","meta":{"title":"echo SOOTHE ESX Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The echo SOOTHE is an easy-to-use baby sound machine with a user-friendly interface and limited features.
