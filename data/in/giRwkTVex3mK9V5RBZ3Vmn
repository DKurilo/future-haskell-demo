The water heater has a thermal efficiency of 90 percent, which can mean more money in your pocket at the end of the year, and can generate a constant flow of water at 3 gallons per minute. With its 76,000-Btu gas burner, it delivers a continuous and constant hot water flow to your home, rather than the sporadic flow of some gas water heaters.","The 50-gallon gas water heater is designed to take up minimal floor space, so it&#39;s taller than a lot of competitors, standing about 68 inches below the draft hood. However, it&#39;s only 27 inches in diameter, so you can put it in a corner and still have more storage space than you might with many other water heater tanks.","Like other gas water heaters, the AO Smith gets water hot when the pilot light is on for the gas-fueled burner at the bottom of the tank. It uses a spiral heat exchanger to retain heated combustion gases within the tank for longer periods. This exchanger is strategically placed in the middle of your tank to better distribute heat and operate at 96 percent thermal efficiency, which is significantly higher than the standard models that operate at 80 percent. The Intelli-Vent Gas Control option makes it easy for you to manage your water temperature and adjust the system diagnostics.","The water heater includes a Green Choice gas burner and a brass drain valve. The Green Choice burner is patented and environmentally friendly, reducing the heater&#39;s nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions by up to 33 percent. The brass drain valve is designed to be more resilient and tamper-resistant than competing plastic models.","Standard features on this water heater include a T&amp;P relief valve, which releases water or steam from the tank if pressure or temperatures get to unsafe levels or if something else goes wrong inside the tank. You can use the reset button to restart the pilot light if it goes out. The water line connection measures 0.75 inches.","This 50-gallon gas water heater has a six-year limited tank and parts warranty. It is designed to leave a minimal impact on the environment and produces fewer emissions than most gas water heaters.","The Vertex Gas Water Heater is pricier than some models, like those from <a href=\"/kenmore-review\">Kenmore</a>, but AO Smith builds a reliable product, and the high efficiency means its output is actually closer to that of a 75-gallon tank. Depending on your needs, it might be worth the extra money up front, particularly because you should save on energy costs by using this gas water heater."]},"id":"0f8cba52-0983-429b-8cff-d438f3d0819a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62023","url":"/ao-smith-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-30T21:15:23Z","datePublished":"2014-12-30T21:15:23Z","name":"AO Smith Vertex GPHE-50","synopsis":"The AO Smith Vertex GPHE-50 is an Energy Star-certified gas water heater designed for a household of about four people and average hot water use.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The AO Smith Vertex GPHE-50 is an Energy Star-certified gas water heater designed for a household of about four people and average hot water use.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-12-30T21:15:23Z","id":"giRwkTVex3mK9V5RBZ3Vmn","meta":{"title":"AO Smith Vertex GPHE-50 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The AO Smith Vertex GPHE-50 is a natural gas water heater.
