It&#39;s a great way to reconnect with old friends and people you haven&#39;t spoken to anywhere but online.","<strong>Is This Service Free?</strong><br/>Spokeo people search shows you the names of potential search matches and what information is available about them, such as their profile, address, phone number and marital status. To view this information, you have to pay a small subscription fee ($4.95 per month for a six-month membership). This subscription gives you up to 20 reports per month. There may also be additional fees required to get access to more private information.","Spokeo issues refunds when there is no information available for a search, and you can cancel your subscription at any time without paying for the months remaining on your subscription.","<strong>Is My Payment Information Secure?</strong><br/>Payments on Spokeo are protected by Norton Security. Your payment information is not saved or added to Spokeo&#39;s database.","<strong>Is My Personal Information Secure?</strong><br/>The information Spokeo gathers is already publicly accessible. Your private information, such as social security number, credit card numbers and other information that can be used for fraud and identity theft, will never appear as the result of a Spokeo search. If you still want your information to be removed from Spokeo, you can use their opt-out page.","<strong>Can My Searches Be Traced Back to Me?</strong><br/>There is no record of the searches you&#39;ve performed on Spokeo. Your search history is completely private, visible only to you.","<strong>Can I Really Find Whom I&#39;m Looking For?</strong><br/>Spokeo people search helps people reconnect with long-lost friends and find out if new friends are not who they seem.

You can also do reverse searches using just a phone number or address. It&#39;s a convenient way to find out who keeps calling you at all hours or partying in the house across the street. In other words, yes, you should be able to find the people you search for.","Spokeo provides about 80% accurate information in an easy-to-read report for a lower price compared to other people search engines.","All it takes is entering someone&#39;s name in a search bar to start finding out more about them.
