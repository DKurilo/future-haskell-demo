Even most POS software requires an internet connection to fully function. At least intermittent internet access is required for software updates, remote assistance and payment processing. However, software solutions are still available and do offer some distinct advantages in certain situations.","POS software is particularly helpful in locations without good access to the internet. If your business is located in a rural area, you can use the software to track your sales, inventory and customer information but then use a standard phone line or mobile connection to process credit cards. Another advantage is that, while the software is expensive, you can purchase it for one upfront price rather than paying for a required monthly subscription to a <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/business/payment-processing/best-pos-systems/\">cloud-based service</a>. A third advantage is that you can be responsible for securing your data. These days, most small-business owners do not want to have to manage their own security or <a href=\"/software/articles/data-backup-solutions-for-small-businesses/\">data backup</a>, but some do, and software installed on a closed network provides that opportunity."]},"id":"c3f2f63a-1839-4e63-8b5e-ec3198969eb8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"POS Software Pros:"},"id":"8ea54a1b-a401-4564-a717-2f455365a349","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["One-time purchase price","Does not require a high-speed internet connection","In-house managed security","Onsite data backup"],"type":"ul"},"id":"f757d4b7-159c-4a55-b83a-8f3f0c8a5aff","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"POS Software Cons:"},"id":"a38742a4-b4f6-4557-bd95-01b0a6a1b23c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["May have to pay for software updates","Requires IT resources for managing backup","Full-Version upgrades are often full-priced","May require you to set up your own back-office"],"type":"ul"},"id":"01236269-668b-4bcd-82c4-fefbc04cf1c2","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Many POS services are migrating to web-based solutions for many reasons.
