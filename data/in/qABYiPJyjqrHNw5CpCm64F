Opting into its subscription service gets you access to organization and scheduling options, extensive guides, filters and mobile viewing options. However, it lacks internal storage and can’t access streaming or cable content. Without a subscription, though, keep in mind its functionality is greatly limited, which is why it sits at the bottom of our lineup.","Unlike some of the other <a href=\"/best-dvrs\">DVR</a> units in our comparison, the Tablo 4-Tuner doesn’t have an internal hard drive to which you can store anything you record. Instead, you have to provide your own external storage. You can skip commercials in any recording and view the TV guide to look for programs to watch or to set a recording schedule.","As its name implies, the 4-Tuner OTA can only access free over-the-air TV content. While you don’t need the DVR recorder at all to watch any of this – only a simple antenna – it can record your favorite basic cable shows so you can rewatch them anytime. However, the unit cannot access or record any content sourced from cable, satellite or streaming services. If you do want access to those sources, consider a different DVR, like the <a href=\"/dish-hopper-review\">Dish Hopper 3</a>.","Purchase of the DVR includes a free 30-day subscription to its service. Once your trial period ends, you can choose to continue with a monthly, yearly or lifetime subscription. The company doesn’t require you to have a subscription to keep using the DVR beyond the free trial, but if you opt out, you’ll miss out on lots of functionality, including a 14-day channel guide, filters, cover art, and extensive search and organization capacity. Additionally, you won’t be able to access the out-of-home streaming feature that lets you view your recorded content on the companion mobile app from anywhere in the world.","The digital video recorder only has two ports: one for Ethernet and a USB 2.0 for your external hard drive storage. Though its lack of input and output options may be a turn-off for advanced users or those wanting to get more out of their DVR, the uncomplicated design is ideal for those less familiar with the technology, wanting to eliminate cords from their lives or who desire a streamlined design for their home’s entertainment center.","Because it doesn’t bother with internal storage or extra ports, the device is small and easy to store. It measures 6.8 inches wide, 4.5 inches deep and 1.6 inches tall, and it weighs under 1 pound. You can contact technical support via email or telephone. Otherwise, you’re free to check out the company’s blog, knowledgebase, user forums, FAQs and general support section on its website.","It is difficult to understand how Nuvyyo justifies the cost of its Tablo 4-Tuner DVR, given its lack of an internal hard drive and accessible content options, as well as its semi-requisite subscription service. Though it’s a decent option for cord cutters or those who only want the basics, it isn’t ideal for avid TV and movie watchers. If you want to record a wider variety of content beyond basic cable, this may not be the right option for you."]},"id":"e9a31c18-f6a0-45bd-bd89-f4f0818b2f87","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70112","url":"/tablo-4-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-07-11T21:24:54Z","datePublished":"2018-07-11T21:24:54Z","name":"Tablo 4-Tuner OTA","synopsis":"With the Nuvyyo Tablo 4-Tuner OTA, you can record four programs simultaneously.
