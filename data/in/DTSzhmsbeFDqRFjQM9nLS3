Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The HP Color LaserJet CP2025dn <a href=\"/money/small-business\">laser printer</a> is your basic color printer with duplexing capabilities. This printing device offers automatic duplex printing features and networking capabilities, and it is ENERGY STAR qualified. Several of the features offered on this device aren’t powerful enough for this laser printer to reach its full potential in a busy office atmosphere, but it is ideal for home use. When looking for a laser printer, you must decide what features are most important to you and if the HP Color LaserJet CP2025dn meets those expectations.","This laser printer offers maximum printing resolution at 600 x 600 dpi (dots per inch). This is the resolution you will find on most basic printers so the low resolution did not surprise us too much. The CP2025dn provides a monthly duty cycle of 40,000 pages. This means you can print up to 40,000 pages a month without causing any damage to your printer or causing it to overheat. The printer doesn’t provide exceptionally fast printing speeds. Both color and black and white prints are printed at 21 pages per minute.","One of the standout features available on the CP2025dn is the automatic duplexing capabilities. This allows you to print on both sides of a single sheet of paper. By using the automatic setting, you do not have to manually turn any pages over to receive prints on both sides. The printer does the task for you.","This laser printer has Ethernet capabilities for networking. This makes it possible for you to share the same printer with multiple computing devices. A USB 2.0 port is also located on the CP2025dn, which offers an additional way to connect your computer to the device. There are 128MB of installed memory available, along with a one-year warranty. The paper tray located on this laser printer has a capacity of 150 sheets. This isn’t very large for a laser printer, especially one used for multiple print jobs on a daily basis. This laser printer is energy-efficient, consuming only 445 watts of energy during use. For a printer this large, we were pleased to see such a low power consumption. In addition, the CP2025dn is ENERGY STAR qualified. This means the device has met the required specifications proving it has energy-saving features and it is an environmentally friendly device.","A basic control pad is located on the top left-hand side of the device. This allows you to control the printer’s functions. It only has a few buttons and controls, which makes it easy to use the printer. The HP CP2025dn is a little on the larger side for a basic printer. It weighs 52.7 pounds, making it difficult to move. It is 15.9 inches wide, 12.7 inches tall and 19.1 inches deep, and these large dimensions will take up a fair amount of space on a desk."]},"id":"a86f2763-14a0-4934-89f2-7c7863ea4db0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"82c8bd91-cd9c-4239-8d64-e6190c8744ca","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Color LaserJet CP2025dn is a basic laser printer.
