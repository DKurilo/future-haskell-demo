The JVC JLE55SP4000 Black Sapphire is the first in a new line of HDTVs with a satisfyingly large screen and a set of features that is quite impressive overall.","We loved this JVC TV model for its surprising sound quality, which is one of the TV&#39;s best features. On the downside, the refresh rate could use an update. While conventional media, such as cable TV programs and DVDs, only support a refresh rate of 120Hz, the 240Hz upscaling that some models offer provides a noticeable improvement in movement smoothness over the JVC&#39;s 120Hz refresh rate. However, the 20,000,000: 1 dynamic contrast ratio and the edge-lit LED technology add greatly to the picture quality, while reducing the power consumption. It consumes only 150 watts of power when in operation, which is well below average, and the 55-inch Black Sapphire competes well with other sets on our list in that area.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"93193553-3251-41ab-874e-666514111152","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Fortunately, JVC&#39;s line of LED TVs comes with a full one-year warranty.
