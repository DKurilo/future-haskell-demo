You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The U-Phono UFO202 from Behringer is a <a href=\"/best-cassette-to-mp3-converters\">cassette to MP3 converter</a> that gives you a lot of options. This converter lets you choose which tape deck to use, but it is an extra purchase, and has a wide array of applications for improving the quality of the final MP3. Though it isn&#39;t nearly as easy to use as other available converters, this product might be one to look into, especially if you are interested in the available software applications that come with it.","When using any cassette to MP3 converter, quality is a top priority. The software application that comes with this product is definitely high quality. It isn&#39;t just one application but a whole suite geared to the different parts of sound quality including noise-reduction, editing, recording and various others. While all of these options are useful, some of them are extraneous to actually improving the cassette to MP3 quality. We were always impressed with the outcome of the MP3.","While this converter works well, and there are lot of options for improving the quality using the software application, it isn&#39;t very easy to use. There are so many ins and outs to the software that it took some time before we felt comfortable using the application. If the software is too difficult to use, or takes too much time, there is a good chance that it won&#39;t be used. The converter itself does nothing to improve the quality but if you are willing to put in the time and the software can be very beneficial.","Getting everything set up is a little bit of a hassle. This device doesn&#39;t come with all of the cables needed to get started. You will have to provide the cables to hook up the converter to the tape deck. While it does offer you the option of choosing which tape deck you want to convert from, you have to provide everything but the USB connector. We prefer solutions that are complete in the box so you don&#39;t have to worry about finding hardware that works properly.","Once everything is hooked up it is simple enough to convert a cassette to MP3. This style of converter also has the advantage that so long as the tape deck comes with an audio out, you can use it. If you have a device that plays mini cassettes, you can convert the mini cassettes to MP3 files.","Having a combination of hardware and software means the help and support offered by the manufacturer had better be comprehensive. While Behringer does provide a little information in the way of FAQs and an email address, it isn&#39;t nearly as wide-ranging as we would like to see, especially since the software is complex. If they could at least have a phone number for direct support or even the manual for the converter online we would be a little happier. As it is, we don&#39;t feel that you could receive timely, comprehensive help if you were to have an issue with this product."]},"id":"6dd66d7f-a47c-44d3-9668-4cff4d4ba384","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"09342319-9fd6-4e82-b46b-a1002b5a2b69","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Be prepared to spend some time learning your way around the U-Phono UFO202 cassette to MP3 converter.
