This laser printer isn&#39;t the fastest in our lineup, but it does boast the sharpest resolution.","This Samsung color laser printer is one of the slowest laser printers that we evaluated. It takes upward of 16 seconds to print the first page. This is the slowest first-page print speed of any printer within our review. After the first page prints, you can print roughly 19 pages per minute. This holds true for both monochrome and color prints. Other printers we reviewed achieve prints speeds upward of 30 pages per minute.","Though this printer lacks in speed, it flourishes in print detail. This color laser printer boasts an ultra-sharp resolution of 9600 x 600 dots per inch (dpi), the highest resolution of any printer that we reviewed. Within the printer&#39;s settings, you can adjust the ink density of each cartridge to get even more sharp and prominent images.","The Samsung C1810W comes with a toner cartridge with a 2,500-page yield and a standard paper tray that holds 250 sheets of paper. You can purchase additional toner cartridges with toner yields of up to 6,000 pages to further reduce printing costs. This printer also makes it easy to perform toner replacements with its top-loading drawer.","This laser printer can also save on energy costs. It is ENERGY STAR certified, uses only 50 watts of power on standby and prints using 380 watts, which is quite energy efficient.","It includes many printing options, including mobile and wireless printing. You can use Google Cloud Print or the Samsung Wireless app to connect to your printer through your mobile phone. You can also password-protect sensitive materials to keep your documents safe.","This printer is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems and is covered by a one-year warranty. If you have any problems with your printer, you can reach Samsung via email, phone or live chat."]},"id":"8f604644-6bb1-4ecb-bd31-be244b694a67","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2a555c50-1acc-4b78-a598-79f37afe027e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung Xpress is a relatively slow printer, but it prints sharp and clean images at a high resolution.
