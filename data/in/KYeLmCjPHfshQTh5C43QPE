Because it mounts on a wall, it takes up no space and can provide needed lighting for dark areas around a home, garage or barn.","This outdoor solar light keeps an area well lit, can recharge up to 1,000 times and has a replaceable battery pack. It will function for a long time before needing a replacement battery. In addition, this light can save you money in the long run, as opposed to many solar lights with disposable batteries that must eventually be replaced.","The 9.5-inch (w) x 12-inch (l) x 12-inch (d) x 10-inch (h) solar light weighs 4.5 pounds and has a matte finish and tempered glass dome that accents its gooseneck design. The dome has an antique, bubbled appearance that suits the lamp&#39;s overall design. The battery pack is lithium-ion, and an 8-foot cord allows for placement of the solar panel wherever it will receive the most direct sunlight. Each hour of direct sunlight will provide roughly 1.5 hours of light at night.","This wall-mounted solar lighting fixture comes equipped with six LEDs in bright white. It produces 120 lumens, which is on the dim side when compared with other outdoor solar lights such as the <a href=\"/sunforce-review\">Sunforce 81256</a>. It tends to work better for dark rural areas, as it might be overpowered by secondary light from street lamps. A half-inch tempered-glass covering tops the solar panel and measures a large 7 inches (w) x 0.50 inches (d) x 7 inches (h). When fully charged, the light will stay on for a full eight hours beginning at sundown. You can pay extra for motion detection, but multiple customers complained that the motion sensor didn’t work consistently."]},"id":"b31d8e76-7e7e-40e3-9008-7bd18deb1c79","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3aba2b83-630a-477b-b286-b3ea531aff8f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Gama Sonic Barn Outdoor Wall Sconce is a gooseneck solar lighting fixture designed to enhance the look of a barn or shed.
