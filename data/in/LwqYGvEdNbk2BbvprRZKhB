You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Landfall Solar Lamp has a contemporary design that lets you decorate your outdoor seating area with style. This <a href=\"/best-solar-lights\">solar LED light</a> is designed just like an indoor lamp and helps your outdoor patio take on the appearance of a living room space. In addition, the weather-resistant construction makes it ideal for outdoor conditions.","The neutral-colored outdoor solar light goes with many decors, and you can also use it as a light source indoors where lighting is necessary but electricity is not available or in times of emergency when the power is out. While this item comes as a set of two lamps, you can also buy the lamps separately.","The spool-shaped solar light displays a bronze finish over steel with a natural rope overlay and a cream drum-shaped lampshade. The body of each lamp measures 16 inches in diameter by 29 inches high. The lampshade is 12 inches in diameter at the top and 16 inches in diameter at the bottom. Felt on the bottom of the lamp guards against damage to table tops. In addition, it uses an on/off switch to control the lighting.","Each lamp weighs 9.7 pounds and operates using three LED bulbs on a solar disc. A 10-foot power cord attached to the base of the lamp lets you use it indoors with electricity, or you can remove the solar disc and take it outdoors to charge.","The LED bulbs power each lamp for solar lighting and shine light as far as 65.62 feet with a beam angle of 120 degrees. The LED lights come with the lamps along with built-in batteries. Replacement parts are also available for this solar outdoor lighting if you need to replace the batteries, the solar disc, the transformer or the lampshade. The lamp carries a one-year warranty, and the company offers a 90-day return policy.","The Landfall Solar Lamp is a contemporary-styled lamp that gives you two ways to charge its solar disc, and you can use it to provide outdoor solar lighting for your outdoor living area or patio. Weather resistance and a sturdy design combine to provide convenient lighting outdoors and emergency lighting indoors in the event of a power outage."]},"id":"450aabd5-99a9-4b1f-9dd6-8f25086a8b2a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67020","url":"/kenroy-home-landfall-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-18T18:49:35Z","datePublished":"2015-09-18T18:49:35Z","name":"Kenroy Home Landfall","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-09-18T18:49:35Z","id":"LwqYGvEdNbk2BbvprRZKhB","meta":{"title":"Kenroy Home Landfall Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Kenroy Home Landfall Solar Lamp lets you light up your outdoor patio or living room without the need for electricity.
