Most POS software can export data to QuickBooks; however, most do not directly exchange data with QuickBooks. Instead, POS software requires you to export data as a CSV file and load that into QuickBooks.

That product is AccuPOS proprietary software, which also syncs with Sage accounting software.","QuickBooks POS is compatible with these QuickBooks accounting products:"]},"id":"37a14155-9f30-426b-bb37-c5a4d50f0ec0","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["QuickBooks Pro or Premier Edition 2008-2012","QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions 8.0-12.0"],"type":"ul"},"id":"6e808337-ade4-483e-9a9c-0f13ddbedb8b","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["QuickBooks offers three POS software versions: Basic, Pro and Multi-Store. The Basic version can manage inventory, manage vendors and process sales. The Pro version can also track employees, process layaways, and manage gift cards and loyalty programs. Multi-Store can track inventory between stores, generate advanced reports and ship/track packages.","You can install QuickBooks POS software on any basic PC running Windows 7 or 8 with 2GB of RAM. The Multi-Store version requires 4GB of RAM. The software works with standard monitors and touchscreen monitors. Your computer has to be connected to the internet for payment processing, product updates and in-product help. You will also need to add the peripherals you need, such as barcode readers, card readers, cash drawers and receipt printers.","<strong>What are the advantages to using QuickBooks POS?</strong>","It is compatible with QuickBooks accounting software and most versions of Excel. It can import customer data from QuickBooks as well.","You can use a computer you already own or a PC of your choice. QuickBooks will also connect you with vendors who can sell you compatible hardware.","It is a one-time purchase rather than a monthly subscription. Monthly subscriptions cost about $40-$80 per month for as long as you use it.","It supports the ringing-up of sales using a smartphone or tablet. It is compatible with iPad, iPhone and Android.","<strong>Are there any limitations to using QuickBooks POS?</strong>","One drawback to using this software is that it works best with a QuickBooks POS merchant account. The payment processing service requires a monthly fee, setup fee, pre-authorization fees and PCI-compliance fees. Although the rates are relatively competitive, many storeowners want the option to shop for the best rates.","QuickBooks POS does not make versions of the software specifically for managing restaurants, quick-serve counters, grocers or salons.","It is costly. The Basic version is about $1,200, Pro is nearly $1,700, and Multi-Store is almost $1,900. These prices are per license. You may want to consider whether an online version or a subscription-based solution might fit your budget better.","The Basic version does not include common features such as the ability to include inventory images with inventory files. Basic also does not manage shipping or employee sales commissions.","If you have a lot of inventory to track and use QuickBooks accounting software, QuickBooks POS may be a suitable option for you. However, if you own a simple retail store, you can obtain a POS solution, such as an iPad or Android POS app, for minimal upfront investment. Although this is powerful POS software for retailers, it is likely out of range for most small businesses, especially considering that they can obtain other payment solutions for less that also include some accounting functions."]},"id":"e6dc5126-28a7-4826-8d46-e10a32c9094b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7220","url":"/quickbooks-point-of-sale-costly-but-convenient","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"pamela-s-stevens","url":"/author/pamela-s-stevens","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Pamela S Stevens","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"e9bBMEAQ9LLhA3c2cSq39Z","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-05-01T19:38:40Z","datePublished":"2012-05-01T19:38:40Z","name":"Is QuickBooks Point of Sale Worth The Cost?","synopsis":"If you use QuickBooks for your accounting and payroll, QuickBooks POS is good addition for managing your point-of-sale needs.","review":{},"strapline":"If you use QuickBooks for your accounting and payroll, QuickBooks POS is good addition for managing your point-of-sale needs.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-02-03T20:56:35Z","id":"SZXKwAfV7Y4QdbJAnnFJ9","meta":{"title":"Is QuickBooks Point of Sale Worth The Cost?","description":"QuickBooks POS is a compatible, easy addition to QuickBooks accounting solutions.
