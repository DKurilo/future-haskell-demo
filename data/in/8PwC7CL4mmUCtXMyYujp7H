This encryption software for Mac authenticates users at boot time and runs in the background so that you don&#39;t need to interact with the application while you work. This is in stark contrast to most of the other encryption software for Mac we reviewed, which require you to pick and choose which files you want to protect and manage the encryption volumes yourself.","When you install SecureDoc on your Mac, the only difference you&#39;ll notice is that there is a new sign-in screen before you even reach OSX. You are asked for login credentials in a separate process from the normal OSX login screen. WinMagic calls this pre-boot authentication. You can choose to log in with a simple password or select a more complicated method to verify your identity. The benefit to pre-boot authentication is that if a computer is ever stolen or accessed by unauthorized personal, the operating system won&#39;t even load until the user is identified.","Another great feature in SecureDoc <a href=\"http://www.tomsitpro.com/tags/mobile-device-management/\">is its mobile device management</a>. We live in an age where almost everyone accesses their data from multiple devices. This can cause major headaches for users and administrators alike because mobile devices can cause a major security breach. However, if they&#39;re locked out of secured areas, users cannot access their data in a timely fashion. The inclusion of mobile device management solves this problem. Once your mobile devices are secured, you can access secure data anywhere without worrying about security breaches.","SecureDoc uses 256-bit AES encryption. This is the strongest cipher protocol, and at the time of this writing remains unbroken. This powerful security system is not only used by almost all the file encryption for Mac software on our side-by-side comparison, but also by high-level U.S. government agencies such as the National Security Administration to protect top secret documents."]},"id":"1a7389f7-5547-40a7-961a-dfeb03fad15b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a9e63477-6593-4247-9002-e226ab7665b2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Possibly the most attractive selling point of SecureDoc for Mac is the completeness of the encryption it performs.
