You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Many <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphones</a> aim for bigger designs to fit all their features. The BlackBerry Torch 9810 is different, as it continues using the same design as older Torch models, but it still packs tons of power into the device to make it a smooth and fast smartphone.","The BlackBerry Torch 9810 is an incredibly portable phone. In its small package, the phone fits a 3.2-inch touchscreen and a slide-out keyboard. Closed, the phone is less than 4.5 inches tall, but when opened, it reaches just under 6 inches. The phone is a little heavier than many other smartphones in this size, and the screen is the smallest on the market. However, for fans of the BlackBerry Torch, this version does not stray from its predecessors and stays familiar.","The smartphone has a 5MP rear-facing camera that takes good images for mobile-to-mobile use. Unfortunately, the phone lacks a front-facing camera. Also, the screen is far from HD, so don&#39;t expect the display to wow you. When next to other smartphones, the BlackBerry Torch 9810 looks old and outdated.","Another unfortunate aspect to the Torch 9810 is its poor call quality. When you&#39;re speaking, your voice gets distorted, and when you use the conference mode, you&#39;ll have issues understanding the person on the other line. The phone&#39;s call quality is an improvement from previous models, but other phones offer much better quality.","The battery can last a full day without a charge, and the phone offers 8GB of internal storage space, more with a memory card. While the phone&#39;s specs don&#39;t necessarily outshine other smartphones, compared to previous models, the Torch 9810 will handle years of use without flinching or faltering.","This BlackBerry smartphone packs the new BlackBerry 7 operating system. Fans of BlackBerry will love the improvements and will quickly understand the changes. This operating system is vastly different from the iOS and the Android, so if you&#39;re coming from one of those models, you&#39;ll want to give yourself some time to learn how to use this phone. The phone&#39;s processor handles apps and software well, but it cannot compare to other phones. The BlackBerry app market does not offer nearly as many apps as iOS, Android or Windows, but you&#39;ll still find plenty of apps to keep you busy or entertained."]},"id":"b532838b-0286-483a-abf1-9520edc840f6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"91700718-be95-42dd-bc1c-1bd5cb15a921","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Everything about the BlackBerry Torch 9810 is an improvement on previous models, and BlackBerry fans will love the new features and processing power.
