You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","Despite the compact designs, <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">high-definition camcorders</a> are not small enough to fit in a pocket. However there is one exception: the Toshiba Camileo X416. At just under five inches long, it is the most compact HD camcorder in our lineup, able to film in full 1080p HD resolution and boasting a three-inch LCD touchscreen viewfinder.","Unfortunately, the Camileo X416 has trouble staying in focus and only films at 30 fps. Also, when filming in full HD, the battery does not last a full two hours, and the camera can only record for 15 minutes. The compact size is great, but you&#39;ll have to buy a second battery and have a few extra memory cards on hand.","One of the best aspects of the Toshiba Camileo X416 is its small size. At about two inches wide, 2.5 inches high and 4.5 inches long, this compact HD camcorder fits in your pocket and is ready to go when you want to record. It weighs under a pound, but so do HD video cameras twice its size, so it feels heavy for its size. You might think that its tiny size would force it to have a smaller viewfinder, but it sports a three-inch LCD viewfinder, similar to many other high-definition camcorders.","The trade-off for this small size is its unimpressive battery. With a full charge, the standard battery does not last a full two hours. Also, at full HD resolution, the 16GB integrated storage only records 15 to 20 minutes of footage. When you&#39;re trying to record your vacation, there&#39;s nothing more frustrating than changing batteries or searching for memory cards.","The Toshiba Camileo X416 is capable of full 1080p resolution at a recording speed of 30 fps. The frame rate might be good for the human eye, but with digital displays that refresh at a much faster rate, your videos will look somewhat choppy.","Also, the Camileo X416 lacks many manual settings, and its automatic focus is extremely frustrating. Despite having face detection, the camera never seems to know what to focus on. The slightest movement of the camcorder causes the lens to refocus. On the viewfinder, you might not notice the adjusting focus, but on a large screen, the picture gets fuzzy for no apparent reason."]},"id":"62feac2d-37bc-49f5-a3b6-105e34b43544","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"95163d70-158e-4ab6-9d08-320dd6edbac1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Toshiba Camileo X416 is a compact HD camcorder that fits in most pockets.
