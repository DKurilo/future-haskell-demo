The Johnson 40-0912 <a href=\"/best-laser-line-levels\">laser line level</a> is designed to do just that. It is easy to use and has functional features to quickly set up and project accurate beams at a variety of heights. This cross-line level gives you pinpoint accuracy when you&#39;re trying to decide where exactly to put that nail without requiring you to mark on or mount a level to the wall.","Because the level is self-leveling, meaning there is a swinging pendulum that sets the lasers straight, you will have a more accurate projection than you’d get with a bubble-style level without having to adjust the level itself too much. An additional feature is that the pendulum locks when the level is not in use, which protects the self-leveling pendulum if you were to drop the device or knock it off the tripod. When the pendulum is locked, it won&#39;t swing and your beams won&#39;t flash to indicate they are not level, which allows you to project angled beams. This laser line level has full 360-degree maneuverability; that does not mean the beams project 360-degrees around the room; rather it means the level has a convenient rotating base that spins completely around.","This crossbeam level has a projection range up to 100 feet away. However, it is accurate up to 35 feet away at 1/4 of an inch, so the closer you are the more accurate your line will be. If you project farther away than 35 feet, your line will be off by 1/4 inch every 35 feet. The accuracy rating is important to ensure you have the best-looking finished projects as possible. A projection of 100 feet is still one of the most powerful projection ranges among the laser line levels we reviewed, which makes this level great for industrial sized jobs. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"d3ab7d13-8a24-49a8-9a0c-59d90a7934c1","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Johnson 40-0912 laser line level is covered by a limited three-year warranty.
