Many spring mattresses, particularly at lower price points, contain coils that are made from one continuous wire. This can affect the mattress’s ability to minimize the transfer of motion from one side of the mattress to the other. The coils of this spring mattress are separate and operate independently, which means it can better reduce the transfer of movement. The ability to isolate motion is particularly important to consider in a spring mattress if you sleep with a partner.","In regards to firmness, this spring mattress is on the plush end of the spectrum. On top of the coils is a soft comfort layer made of high-density foam with a thickness of 1.5 inches. An additional layer of 3-inch foam provides extra comfort and softness, and the top cover of this Night Therapy spring mattress is made from silky bamboo rayon fibers. Given the plushness of the mattress, most customers agree that it is best suited for stomach and side sleepers. Those who sleep on their back may need a firmer spring mattress to prevent back pain."]},"id":"cdb117ab-09c8-477f-aa6c-d52b60fd1104","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Mu9ZtRHSgd5NoScsaEEYyc.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58401-night-therapy-deluxe-euro-box-top1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mu9ZtRHSgd5NoScsaEEYyc.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Mu9ZtRHSgd5NoScsaEEYyc","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mu9ZtRHSgd5NoScsaEEYyc.jpg","alt":""},"id":"fe604d3a-cbab-47cb-9aae-b207a8e18a35","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When you compare mattresses, it is also important to consider the warranty. Manufacturers typically limit mattress warranties to manufacturing defects, so the longer the warranty on your mattress, the better. This spring mattress only comes with a 10-year warranty, which pales in comparison to the 25-year warranties that accompany some of the best mattresses.","If you read mattress reviews, it’s clear the Night Therapy Deluxe Euro Box Top mattress ranks among the best in its class. Its independent coils in conjunction with the soft comfort layers make for a very cushioned mattress. If you prefer plush over firm in a spring mattress, this one can provide you with relaxing and rejuvenating sleep from the very first night."]},"id":"9dd26d9d-f1bb-4e6a-ae74-d1d3351c98c2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58429","url":"/night-therapy-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-12T19:36:05Z","datePublished":"2013-12-12T19:36:05Z","name":"Night Therapy Deluxe Euro","synopsis":"The Night Therapy Deluxe Euro Box Top may not be as well known as its brand name counterparts, but this spring mattress has glowing online reviews.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Night Therapy Deluxe Euro Box Top may not be as well known as its brand name counterparts, but this spring mattress has glowing online reviews.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-12-12T19:36:05Z","id":"QKuSrYXrC3iZhGJTVMPu7R","meta":{"title":"Night Therapy Deluxe Euro Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Prefer plush over firm in a spring mattress?
