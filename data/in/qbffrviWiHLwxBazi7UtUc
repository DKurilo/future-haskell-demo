This  <a href=\"/best-cookbook-and-recipe-software\">Mac recipe software</a> has the most advanced step-by-step cooking tools of all the Mac recipe software we reviewed, making it a good resource for beginner cooks. The program reads each step in the recipe to you out loud, and you can even configure it to recognize voice commands such as &#34;next,&#34; &#34;go back&#34; or &#34;repeat.&#34;","This recipe software for Mac has impressive shopping list features. You can create multiple lists to suit your needs, such as a list of next week&#39;s meals in addition to another created specifically for that special dinner tomorrow night. You can add an entire recipe or a single ingredient to any shopping list, which is a nice feature. You also have the ability to prevent certain ingredients in a recipe from going into a shopping list when the recipe is added to a list, which is great if you have any food allergies. If you decide you want the ingredient at a later time, you can manually add it to your shopping list.","However, these impressive features cannot make up for the things that this recipe manager for Mac lacks. Its biggest downfall is its lack of advanced search options. Search options are important, especially when you build a large collection of recipes. So, if you have a massive collection, you will find it a hassle to wade through a long list, even after entering very specific search terms.","Furthermore, SousChef offers no menu planning support whatsoever. If you are looking for software to help you make daily, weekly or monthly menus, SousChef is not what you are looking for.","This recipe program for Mac does offer excellent technical support, which you can receive via email. This Mac recipe software also has some convenient options that let you share recipes on your own personal blog, MarsEdit or HTML-based blog."]},"id":"e223b9ed-6e9d-48cc-aae1-dd25bddba98d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dfd1c839-d0c8-4d75-b1fe-7560c97d1da2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["SousChef has an aesthetically pleasing user interface, excellent step-by-step instructions and an impressive shopping list function.
