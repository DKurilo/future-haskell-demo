The PSB Alpha series B1 <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1274-best-bookshelf-speakers.html\">bookshelf speaker</a> is an installment of the audio prowess that PSB can display.","When you remove the grille, you find a 5.25-inch polypropylene cone combined with a .75-inch aluminum dome tweeter within the bass reflex enclosure. The speaker enclosure has a rear-facing port and two-way binding posts. These bookcase speakers are average in size, measuring 11.9 x 7.2 x 9.75 inches and weighing a little over 10 pounds.","With any small bookshelf speaker, the low-end frequency response isn&#39;t as prominent as that of a full-range tower speaker. The 60Hz low frequency response the Alpha B1 produces is ample, but it doesn&#39;t satisfy your needs for prominent deep bass. The bass tones it does produce, though, are punchy and clean. The lack of bass doesn&#39;t muddy up the overall sound, a good characteristic for a bookshelf speaker that boasts only a 5.25-inch woofer.","One shortcoming of the Alpha B1 is its narrow sound directionality. As you move around the room, the sound from the B1s can lose punctuality. The directional nature of these speakers is why they are used prominently as surround sound speakers, as opposed to the main speakers in home entertainment centers.","The high frequency tonality the .75-inch tweeter produces is soft and nonabrasive. The sweet-sounding high frequency tones will never leave you cringing or reaching to turn down the volume. However, if you turn the volume up too high, the tonal quality falters.","The mid tones are the pride of the B1. The mid-frequency range is right in the 5.25-inch speakers&#39; wheelhouse. Tones produced within the midrange sound natural and accurate, the exact properties you want from your surround sound speakers.","The B1 bookshelf speakers run off a minimum of 10 watts of power and handle a maximum of 90 watts. These speakers have clean tones, but not the overall volume or power handling to stand alone like some of our best bookshelf speakers."]},"id":"73fcd5ba-bea5-4021-9a15-39d7aec45e44","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"29b1e0f5-c146-4e18-9c5e-7cb473c696b5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The PSB bookshelf speakers have clean and natural tonality, exactly what you&#39;d want from your surround sound speakers.
