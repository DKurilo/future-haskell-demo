Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When does a phone redesign trigger the craving for an upgrade? Even though advances in <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> design have raised the bar in favor of slimmer devices, the Motorola Droid X2 is a solid product with an excellent reputation for packing a lot of value into a handset. Yet there&#39;s no compelling case for a Droid X2 upgrade for existing Droid X users, since the changes – with a few exceptions – represent a mostly modest refresh.","That&#39;s not to say that the Droid X2 isn&#39;t an excellent phone in its class in terms of its performance, however. The Droid X2 continues to offer excellent readability in natural sunlight. The screen display has increased in size (480 x 854 pixel resolution to 540 x 960), but with a bigger screen that has only two sub-pixels per pixel, some users have complained of a less smooth appearance. Even so, the bigger screen outweighs that minor drawback, and there are no significant issues regarding readability.","Most of the drawbacks to this popular device&#39;s upgrade are missed opportunities to make some needed improvements, but one drawback is a dropped feature – say goodbye to a physical camera button. This has been replaced with a touchscreen button.","On the other hand, four physical buttons at the bottom of the phone screen generate some performance complaints. These buttons are Menu, Home, Back and Search. Reports from users include complaints of a lack of responsiveness when users give them a glancing tap. The biggest beef is that this phone is beefy, long after other comparable devices have slimmed down. Another issue is the lack of 4G compatibility. This is why some pundits suggested there&#39;s just not enough meat on the plate to justify a second serving. Some will choose to wait until a new dish is served. Knowing Motorola&#39;s reputation, users will be expecting one tasty refresh.","The Droid X2 has a strikingly similar appearance to the Droid X. As for making the argument for an upgrade, this phone adds a dual-core CPU with support for an HDMI output port, and the mirroring output works beautifully at a full 1080p resolution. Another incentive is a very high-performance battery. Travelers who are frugal with energy usage can easily stretch this phone&#39;s charge out to a week on standby, and one reviewer said a day&#39;s usage still left juice in the battery.","Although this phone probably does not justify an upgrade for an existing Droid X user (unless the HDMI-out port is a must-have feature), it&#39;s a high-quality device at a competitive price for new users. Let&#39;s not forget that for all the bells and whistles that have been added to smartphones, they are, ultimately, phones first and foremost. In that capacity, the Droid X offers the same high-quality voice communications for which it is already well known.","For those who do not mind the lack of a slimmer profile, this device still retains the 8MP camera – one that deserves credit for its powerful performance. You can also expect to have all the widgets smartphone users have come to love and appreciate on your Droid X2."]},"id":"05d78a17-c016-4f4a-a63e-9863f2bd2cd3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7e08d97c-8199-4774-9a24-ffcc6f7c476e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Droid X2 is a fantastic starter phone for a new smartphone user, and the HDMI-out port may be enough to justify an upgrade.
