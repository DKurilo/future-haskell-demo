You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Pyro Audio Creator, the latest <a href=\"/best-cd-burning-software\">CD burning software</a> from Cakewalk, is a self-explanatory product that is simple to install and set up. The application is divided into four parts: Encoder, Ripper, Tagger and Burner. These features do exactly what you expect them too. While we usually enjoy a stripped-down, keep-it-simple approach to software user interfaces, Pyro seems to have taken this to a self-harming extreme. The application looks like a computer-programming student designed it. While this isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, we have a hard time getting behind the integrity of the code. If developers don&#39;t care about what an application looks like, we can&#39;t assume that they care about the fundamentals of the tasks the software is designed to perform.","Looks notwithstanding, Pyro offers all of the features needed to burn CDs. However, it lacks many of the convenient features we found in competing products. Pyro is limited to burning CDs; it does not offer any options to burn DVDs or images. It should be pointed out that both Windows and Mac operating systems perform these functions natively, though.","Also, you cannot erase a CD-RW with this software, and it also lacks the ability to copy a disc in RAW mode. Pyro is a straightforward product; five simple tabs represent its basic CD burning options. Once you select an option, you only need to drag and drop the individual audio tracks to your copy destination. Once you&#39;ve done that, you simply press the Burn button to begin the process. Installing Pyro is uncomplicated. The application is straightforward and easily set up. The help documentation is both useful and easy to understand. The included help guides you through the burn process step by step."]},"id":"4cd1df25-7416-42d1-a495-17c2e5903c12","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"537746a9-ba0e-4747-bba8-7f39258198ec","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At the end of the day, we don&#39;t know why anyone would pay for this program when there are features in every OS that perform the same function without requiring additional software at an additional cost. Not only are these features free, but the native OS versions of these CD-burning features generally do the job than Pyro Audio Creator does. Furthermore, free applications such as iTunes and Windows Media Player also have every single feature in Pyro Audio Creator, and sometimes more."]},"id":"5458a3c3-35c3-4a3d-8eea-0fcc4cdb474d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_199","url":"/pyro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
