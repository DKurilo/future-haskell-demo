It comes with just enough features for you to develop basic espresso-making skills while saving you lots of money each month. The Bella is a steam espresso maker that makes hot coffee drinks including latte and cappuccino.","Like the best espresso machine we reviewed, the Bella Espresso comes with a combined measuring and tamping tool. The measuring scoop is a little bigger than the portafilter so it&#39;s difficult to pour coffee grounds into the filter without spilling. The tamper fits nicely and gives you the flexibility to tamp loosely or firmly for a taste that matches your preference.","The steam wand is stationary, so it will take some practice to figure out the best technique for frothing and heating milk. You can use the wand to dispense water for making other hot drinks like tea and hot cocoa.","The water tank is not removable. However, since the Bella Espresso maker comes with a carafe, you can easily use it to fill the machine with the right amount of water. The tray is permanently attached to the machine, but since the grate is removable, you can still easily clean up any water or espresso spills.","The Bella Espresso needs to be manually washed and primed before using it for the first time. The first couple of times the machine is used, there may be a strong, hot plastic smell. If you use the machine with just water a few of times, the smell should go away and not taint your espresso.","This machine becomes very hot, even on the bottom, and can cause plasticizing. This is when a hot appliance causes discoloring of the counter. It is important to place a non-plastic coaster or placemat under this cappuccino maker when using to reduce the possibility of damaging your counter top.","The Bella Espresso machine comes with a polarized plug. This means it can only be plugged into an outlet one way. This safety feature helps reduce the possibility of electric shock. Make sure your espresso maker is the only thing plugged into the outlet when in use. Overloaded electrical outlets could reduce the power fed to your machine and reduce its performance.","The instructions included with the Bella Espressa are not easy to follow. The pictures help with the initial setup and priming directions, but there are no instructions for brewing cappuccino, cleaning or descaling and other simple maintenance tasks. You can get help via telephone or by filling out the email form on the Bella website."]},"id":"fddaac9f-9de7-41fa-880e-86ea36186c2a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a390022a-c01a-4f39-89eb-442740269918","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bella Espresso is a good cappuccino maker for learning the art of Italian coffee brewing.
