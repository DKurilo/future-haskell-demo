This <a href=\"/best-webcams\">web camera</a> is small, making it perfect to fit on top of your laptop. This excellently designed camera also has decent quality video making this a steal for the price.","The video on the LifeCam HD-6000 had a little trouble totally syncing up to the audio, but the picture and sound by themselves were quite impressive. The resolution can be set to a maximum of 1280 x 720, but if you feel your laptop is not running the video as smoothly as you would like, you can always lower the resolution to get a smoother video signal.","A set of features that are really fun to play with are the video effects that come with the Microsoft LifeCam HD series. The face tracking is what makes the fun effects possible. Many other webcams will paste an effect to the screen and you need to position yourself in the correct place for it to work. With the facial tracking, you can add funny effects like question marks that float above your head or a crown that sits on your head and it will follow you around the room. Some effects work better than others but we were impressed by the video effects and face tracking.","Another feature that we found to be decent was the light correction on this webcam. We tested it by dimming the lights and using the computer monitor as the only lighting for the webcam, and though it took a moment to adjust to the light, the LifeCam made the picture look good and not too dim.","The LifeCam HD-6000 has a smart design that&#39;s simple to use. It is one of the few webcams that rotates a full 360 degrees and has a clamp that allows you to easily clip the HD webcam to the screen. The LifeCam HD-6000 is the only model in the series that you can’t set down on a desk next to a computer because it doesn’t have a flat base.","Like most Microsoft products, this series of HD webcams is compatible with Microsoft operating systems such as Windows 8, 7 and Vista. None of the software or drivers are currently compatible with Mac products.","Microsoft LifeCam products are backed by a three-year warranty. This and Microsoft’s excellent telephone and email support should give you confidence when you are deciding to make a purchase on a product from the LifeCam HD series."]},"id":"f6eee6d7-fa21-42d8-be0a-ae7658bf170f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1a8b0c4b-26a2-4b5c-8db2-072457dd0d22","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LifeCam HD-6000 is a decent buy from the LifeCam series.
