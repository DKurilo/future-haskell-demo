The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-dvd-ripper-software\">DVD Ripper Software</a> here.</em>","Corel’s DVD Copy 6 Plus includes software that makes ripping DVD video, AVI files or other video to your iPhone, PSP, Zune, computer hard drive, or another DVD disc a simple matter of point and click. We were impressed first and foremost by the simplicity of the program. That’s not to say that Corel DVD Copy 6 Plus’ feature set is underwhelming. On the contrary, it is a versatile and competent DVD ripper software, DVD burner and resource for preserving your multimedia library.","Corel DVD Copy 6 Plus stands out among other DVD rippers because it is also a highly competent video converter. If you regularly transfer media from your computer to your DVR to your iPhone to your laptop, Corel DVD Copy 6 Plus offers comprehensive file support. In addition to creating ISO images for future use, making 1:1 DVD clones and ripping DVD to hard drives, Corel DVD Copy 6 converts between iPod, Zune, PSP, MPEG, Quicktime, TiVO, DivX, AVI and WMV file formats.","We really love the ability to transfer TiVO programs to DVD disc—that way you don’t have to use up your DVR’s hard drive to keep your favorite TV shows handy.","Users interested in ripping copyrighted DVDs or transferring copyrighted materials to different devices should bear in mind that Corel DVD Copy 6 Plus respects copyright law. Burning, ripping, and backing up home movies or public domain materials, however, is remarkably easy on Corel DVD Copy 6.","No product we tested features such a simple, visually oriented interface. To rip a DVD onto your hard drive, you simply select a DVD icon and choose a save location. To rip DVD to iPod, you simply select the DVD icon and select the iPod icon. Corel clearly put some thought into streamlining the potentially confusing process of navigating ISO, AVI, DivX and MOV files. Corel DVD Copy is one of the few DVD ripping programs that a complete novice should feel comfortable with after five minutes of use.","We were impressed with the playback quality of our DVD rips using Corel DVD Copy 6 Plus. MPEGs and H.264 video files looked as good as the originals. We would say however, that while of acceptable quality, DivX HD video files looked slightly washed out in color and resolution.","Ripping DVD and video to mobile devices was effective in all of our test runs. Corel DVD Copy 6 Plus is a very useful “one stop” utility for iPhone, Zune and PSP. One complaint that is sure to arise however, is the fact that Corel DVD Copy 6 Plus doesn’t allow for custom resolutions—this might be problematic for users with nonstandard mobile devices.","The dedicated and thorough support of the Corel team is a clear advantage to Corel DVD Copy 6 Plus. They have a massive knowledge base with FAQs, tutorials and articles. Corel also offers email customer support."]},"id":"bb827400-a45d-4501-8bfc-201506e714ab","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ba417d3c-23df-4bfa-880a-591969c78677","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Corel DVD Copy 6 Plus is an ideal DVD ripper, DVD copier and video converter for basic users.
