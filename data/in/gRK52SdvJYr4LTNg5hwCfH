You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Alienware 17 R4 is one of the most interesting <a href=\"/best-home-computers\">computers</a> we reviewed. Its core components make it a strong performer for both work and play, and you have several options for connecting peripherals. The base model comes with a solid-state drive (SSD), an impressive 16GB of RAM and Windows 10 Home 64-bit. The powerful processor and ample storage and memory make it the best laptop for gaming on the go, and it’s perfect for streaming video at home.","The base model of the R4 has some impressive components. It uses a seventh-generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor – a unit surpassing most of the other computers in our lineup. This CPU received a PassMark score of 8,968 from CPUBenchmark.net. For context, a score over 5,000 means a computer can handle most tasks without slowdown.","Having such a powerful processor is great if you have a family, as it can handle the wide variety of programs, including data-intensive programs, and it can load content-heavy webpages and frequently switch between multiple programs. Additionally, Alienware designed this to be a gaming laptop, so with its powerful components, you can game anywhere. If you simply want a powerful gaming computer for your home, check out the <a href=\"/alienware-aurora-review\">Alienware Aurora</a>.","With 16GB of DDR4 memory, you won’t have to worry about slow performance. While you can perform basic tasks with just 4GB of memory, and 8GB lets you enjoy multitasking, 16GB is exactly what serious gamers need. This amount will also allow you to stream high-definition video.","Most people want a PC computer the family can use for doing homework, paying bills, looking up information, watching videos or storing important documents and family photos. While the R4 certainly can do that, its ability to double as a gaming computer is handy if you have a gamer in the family. Nonetheless, the R4’s built-in 128 solid-state drive (SSD) AND 1TB hard drive let you store plenty of stuff, and even keep your games and other intensive files or programs on the SSD for quicker access. Also, as with many desktop PCs, you can upgrade and expand the storage to your specifications if you purchase the machine directly from Alienware.","This computer comes with plenty of connectivity options for all of your peripherals. With three USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3 port, you can charge your phone and connect external hard drives, displays, jump drives and many other devices. It has both HDMI and DisplayPort connections, for further connectivity, which is handy for watching videos from your computer on a larger screen.","Built-in Wi-Fi means you aren’t tethered to an Ethernet cord. Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity lets you easily pair the computer with Bluetooth-capable devices like a headset or your smartphone.","Customer support for the 17 R4 is available directly through phone, email and live chat. Phone and chat are your quickest bets, though chat and email allow you to keep transcripts of your conversation. If you would rather not talk to anyone, you can check out the multitude of informational resources on the manufacturer’s website.","The Alienware 17 R4 is a solid gaming laptop that could easily double as your family’s dedicated home computer. With some excellent components, such as its powerful processor, extensive storage and plenty of memory, and a variety of ports, its features and functionality make it a great option."]},"id":"cf9480ec-e67e-4e49-bc45-4c8e6a128bb1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69667","url":"/alienware-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-10-24T16:11:41Z","datePublished":"2017-10-24T16:11:41Z","name":"Alienware 17 R4","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":30,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-10-24T16:11:41Z","id":"gRK52SdvJYr4LTNg5hwCfH","meta":{"title":"Alienware 17 R4 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Alienware 17 R4 is a powerful gaming laptop that can handle even the most intensive tasks.
