This ready-to-fly UAV has an altitude sensor and GPS receiver onboard, which both keep your drone stabilized, helping you get cleaner footage and pictures. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no camera included with this drone.","This RC drone is quite small and only measures 11.38 x 11.38 x 8.07 inches. It comes with a two-axis gimbal that keeps the camera oriented and tilted in the same direction as the drone, resulting with smoother video for you. Walkera offers a One Key to Home feature that uses the drone&#39;s GPS to automatically land the drone. This feature will definitely come in handy if you are just starting out flying. As for intermediate users or hobbyists, you can flip on manual mode and be entirely in control.","Since this personal drone doesn&#39;t have a built-in camera, you will have to purchase a camera separately to mount onto the drone, and this is its major downfall. However, you can order a compatible camera from Walkera when you purchase your drone.","You get 25 minutes of battery life with this drone and impressive speeds of up to 45 miles per hour. It only takes an hour to recharge the battery, so you can spend less time waiting around and more time flying. If you plan on using the drone to carry cargo, the QR X350 Pro can carry an additional seven ounces.","A transmitter and transmitter battery are included. You&#39;ll also get extra propellers, which you&#39;ll more than likely need. Since the drone is so fast, it&#39;s easy to lose control. If things do go wrong or you need replacement parts, the drone does have a warranty. However, it is only for seven days. Walkera has telephone and email support. You can download the instruction manual for this drone on its website."]},"id":"72882d12-e04f-4cdd-aa15-802570cfe024","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2e7159bc-baf0-4b0a-b466-66e3318ea464","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["What is good about the Walkera QR X350 Pro GPS drone is how flexible it is.
