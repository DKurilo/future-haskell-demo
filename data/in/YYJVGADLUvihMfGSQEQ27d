Pioneer D-series of <a href=\"/best-car-speakers\">car speakers</a> was designed to produce the widest range of frequencies. Indeed, it has the widest frequency response range of any speaker I&#39;ve reviewed, reaching a low of 33Hz and a high of 42kHz, which is far beyond the scope of human hearing. However, while the TS-D69F model from the series performed well enough to be a good improvement over most factory-installed speakers, it didn&#39;t impress us enough to rank as one of the top 10 coaxial car speakers.","To test audio performance, I recorded the TS-D69F repeatedly playing a sine tone that transitioned from 20Hz to 20kHz. Then I used frequency response software to create the average frequency signature produced by the speaker and compared it to the 20Hz to 20kHz frequency signature. The TS-D69F received a C grade for overall audio performance.","It performed best in the highs, receiving an A- grade for accuracy. This is to be expected with a frequency response that reaches 42kHz. However, it received a C for accuracy in the midrange frequencies and a C- for the low frequencies. This makes for unbalanced audio performance where the highs tend to slice through the mix, though this could be preferable for some.","The TS-D69F was the least efficient speaker I tested, earning a C- in the comparative loudness test. During this test, I measured the volume the speaker produced at various stereo settings and compared it to other speakers’ output on the same settings.","However, its below-average performance wasn&#39;t surprising – the TS-D69F’s sensitivity rating is 87 dB, which is the lowest of the speakers we reviewed. It&#39;s not a highly efficient speaker at converting power to volume. That said, it&#39;s capable of getting very loud. Despite being comparatively quiet, it still broke the 100-dB barrier when connected to a standard 200-watt car stereo. That&#39;s plenty loud enough to cause permanent hearing damage.","The other two Pioneer speakers I tested performed better in both audio quality and comparative loudness. The <a href=\"/pioneer-pro-review\">Pioneer TS-6900PRO</a> speaker received an A grade for overall audio quality and an A+ for comparative loudness, while the Pioneer TS-A6996R received a B for overall audio quality and a B for comparative loudness. If you&#39;re a fan of Pioneer, the PRO speaker is one of the best I&#39;ve tested, and the TS-A6996R is an affordable option.","The TS-D69F’s power handling specifications are mostly average, as it’s designed for most car stereo installations. The continuous power handling is rated for 110 RMS watts, which is about 2 watts above average. Its peak power handling is 330 watts, which is about 66 watts below average. While these aren&#39;t the most impressive power handling specifications, you don&#39;t really need higher ones unless you have an external amplifier.","The D-series isn&#39;t as comprehensive as it has been in the past. Currently, the series has several 6 x 9-inch speakers, a 6 x 8-inch speaker and several 6.5-inch speakers, but it&#39;s lacking a 5.25-inch speaker, which is a common size. However, it&#39;s one of the few speaker series that also has subwoofers."]},"id":"cd0ab0b8-d0a4-441e-8dbe-8aa57a828764","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c284db99-55fe-41e6-a591-093143a8953f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pioneer TS-D69F has excellent highs, but its midrange and lows are subpar. This leads to an unbalanced mix where the highs dominate.
