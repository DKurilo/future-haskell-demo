The BreatheSmart has an optional ionizer, which charges oxygen atoms with a positive or negative charge as they pass through the ionizer. These charged atoms attract particles in the air, allowing the filter to easily capture these larger particles. It is important to note that charged particles produced from ionizers can harm sensitive lungs, and they may exacerbate breathing-related issues. Fortunately, the ionizer can be turned off and the California Air Resource Board (CARB) certifies the BreatheSmart as a product that is safe to use in your home. To be certified by CARB, air purifiers must meet an emission limit of 0.050 parts per million. The BreatheSmart is also Energy Star verified and has an Underwriters Laboratories Inc.

If the air is clean, the fan runs at a lower speed, and if the sensor picks up more particles, the fan speeds up to capture the pollutants.
