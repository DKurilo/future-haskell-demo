This experience has helped inform many of our conclusions relating to other heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment. We apply exacting standards to each product we test, primarily focusing on performance and user-friendliness. We design our tests to simulate typical consumer experiences.","When, as in the case of in-wall air conditioners, we cannot test the physical product ourselves, we apply the same due diligence to make sure our information and conclusions reflect the mission of Top Ten Reviews.","<strong>How we evaluated</strong>","As we evaluated wall-mounted air conditioning units, we weighed cooling ability and energy efficiency more heavily than other features. Since air conditioners are used first and foremost to regulate the temperature and keep you comfortable, we considered how well each unit circulates air, what modes it has and if it works effectively.","We looked at each unit&#39;s energy efficiency and estimated how much it costs to operate per year based on a three-month period of use with it running eight hours per day. High energy efficiency is vital to lowering your electric bills each month and reducing energy use.","We also considered ease of use, noting each unit&#39;s modes of operation. Every in-wall AC we reviewed includes a remote control and a programmable timer, convenient features that allow you to control the air conditioner from across the room and set it to turn on and off at specific times.","Even though in-wall air conditioners are permanent fixtures and not meant to be moved around, it&#39;s a good idea to look at how heavy a unit is before installing it. The average weight of the wall air conditioners we reviewed is about 80 pounds, which makes them difficult to install by yourself.","<strong>In-wall air conditioner installation</strong>","If you don’t already have a sleeve in your wall for an in-wall air conditioner, you will probably want to have your new AC professionally installed. Unless you have previous installation experience or are confident you can install an AC unit yourself, professional installation is recommended. ","On the other hand, if you have an existing wall sleeve, you can install your new air conditioner on your own. You first need to prepare it by thoroughly cleaning it out and making sure it is in secure working order. If you can see through the sleeve to the outside of your home, the AC will probably have the ventilation it needs to breathe and function properly.","You need to precisely measure the sleeve before you purchase a new air conditioner. Be sure your new AC fits snugly into the existing sleeve. Look for a universal-fit, rear-breathing air conditioner, since they are designed to fit the vast majority of sleeves.","There is a chance you won’t be able to find an AC that fits perfectly into the sleeve, but that isn’t necessarily a problem. As long as the AC isn’t too big for the sleeve and there isn’t too much excess space around the air conditioner, you can make it fit with a few adjustments. Simply place foam padding inside the sleeve to fill all of the gaps between it and the AC. Once all the empty space is filled, you can buy a frame that fits snugly around the outside of the air conditioner to give it a finished look.  ","<strong>Things to consider when choosing an in-wall air conditioner</strong>","<strong>1. Room size &amp; cooling performance</strong>","Air conditioners use British thermal units (BTU) to indicate the size of the room they can cool. Using a calculation from the Energy Star organization, an air conditioner rated at 5,000 BTU can cool rooms up to 150 square feet, whereas a unit with 7,000 Btu can cool rooms up to 300 square feet. An easy way to check BTU is through a <a href=\"https://www.miniwebtool.com/air-conditioner-btu-calculator/\">BTU calculato</a>r. Just bare in mind there are a range of factors that could affect your <a href=\"https://www.hometips.com/buying-guides/air-conditioners-room.html\">through-the-wall air conditioner’s cooling capacity</a>. ","The next thing to consider is the model&#39;s maximum airflow, measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). A higher CFM means better airflow in a room, which helps improve cooling performance.","<strong>2. Efficiency ratings &amp; certification</strong>","Every air conditioner has an energy efficiency ratio (EER), and the higher the EER, the more efficient the air conditioner is. The average EER of the window air conditioners we compared is 10.3, with the most efficient unit having an EER rating over 10.7. Typically, appliances that are Energy Star certified are 20 to 30 percent more efficient than the minimum requirements.","UL Listed products have been tested by Underwriters Laboratories, which is a safety consulting company. AHAM-certified units have passed performance evaluations by Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers.","<strong>3. How much does a through-the-wall air conditioner cost? </strong>","Cost is another important consideration. The wall ACs in our comparison range between about $400 and $800. Our best overall, the Frigidaire FFTA1233Q1, has a great feature package and is economically priced in the midrange at $600. The most affordable unit, the Koldfront WTC8001W, has some nice convenience features like sleep and auto mode and is priced at about $400. The most expensive unit is the GE AJCQ12DCG at about $800, which is an efficient, well-made unit, but its features don’t necessarily stand out enough to justify the extra expense. Our side-by-side comparison will help you find the unit with the features you need at the most reasonable price. ","<strong>4. Wall-mounted AC units operation modes</strong>","Regardless of which air conditioner you purchase, you want one with customizable modes you can match to your preferences. Choose a unit with cooling modes, fan-only modes and adjustable fan speeds. If you live in a humid environment, look for one with a dehumidifying mode that pulls excess moisture out of the air.
