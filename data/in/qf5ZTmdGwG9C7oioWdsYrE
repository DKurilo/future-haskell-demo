Your bandwidth determines how quickly signals transfer from your computer to the VPN server to the website you are accessing. With unlimited bandwidth, pages load quickly and attachments, even large documents, send without lag time. Bandwidth also allows you to download content quickly, so your day-to-day business activities don’t slow down. Many services advertise that they have unlimited bandwidth. In fact, you will find that companies across the board offer it, so don’t choose one based on bandwidth alone – just expect it to be there.","Web proxies keep you anonymous by cycling through IP addresses – that way, your search history and data cannot be connected to you through your registered IP. The more servers, locations and IP addresses a proxy service has, the more difficult it is to trace your online activity back to you or to be blocked by an online service, since the IP changes each time you log in.","<strong>Web Proxy Security</strong>","<strong>Tunneling</strong><br/>VPNs use something called tunneling to package and transfer information. Tunneling is when a secure internet connection is established between a server and a device like a computer, smartphone or tablet. The information sent through the tunnel is first encrypted, then sent via the secure connection across the internet and unpacked on the other side. While this whole process occurs in the blink of an eye, it is a multi-step procedure designed to protect your security.","The different methods proxy sites use to tunnel and transfer your data are call protocols. A few of the most popular are PPTP, site-to-site VPN, L2TP VPN, IPsec and SSL.","<strong>PPTP</strong><br/>Point-to-point tunneling protocol, or PPTP, is the most popular and widely used. One of the advantages of PPTP is that it’s cost effective. However, its connections are not as stable as other tunnel protocols, so there is a slight chance your connection could be dropped or penetrated, making you less secure. <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn\">OverPlay VPN</a> is one proxy service that uses PPTP as one of its protocol methods.","<strong>OpenVPN</strong><br/>Another frequently used tunneling protocol is OpenVPN, which is an open-source software used by companies like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn\">IPVanish VPN</a>. It mixes Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) keys that connect you directly to the website you want to access and keep your data encrypted so hackers can’t swipe it. OpenVPN also relies on advanced security features, such as user authentication via usernames, passwords, key codes and certificates. It is one of the most secure virtual private networks on the market; however, it is more expensive to run.","<strong>Support</strong><br/>Access to help and support is important for any service, but it is especially so when you rely on that service to protect your data from prying eyes. Support should be available through email and over the phone. Live chat support is also helpful, since it quickly connects you to customer representatives.","Choosing the right VPN provider is important for protecting your information online and ensuring that you transfer information across your network securely. While all services offer basic protection, there are a few features that make certain providers stand out such as the number of IP addresses they use and kill switches. It’s also important to consider whether the service itself keeps a log of you online activity while you’re connected through its VPN."]},"id":"7b152cb3-2ef7-49c8-b458-b3ad9ff0ccbf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"9e7a2dc1-5e60-4de2-81bc-0bef67f9b6a6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.goldenfrog.com/vyprvpn/special/referral?offer_id=129&aff_id=2091&TDMBG\">VyprVPN</a>","<a href=\"https://checkout.hidemyass.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=PRIVAXLT&AFFILIATE=1896&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hidemyass.com%2Faffiliate%2Favangate&AFFSRC=ProxyServices\">HMA VPN</a>","<a href=\"https://billing.purevpn.com/aff.php?aff=2327\">PureVPN</a>","<a href=\"http://torguard.net/aff.php?aff=279\">TorGuard</a>","<a href=\"https://www.ipvanish.com/ttr_vpn/?a_aid=toptenreviews&chan=tt25\">IPVanish</a>","<a href=\"https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/MIKETOPTEN001\">Private Internet Access</a>","<a href=\"http://www.ibvpn.com/billing/aff.php?aff=1319\">ibVPN</a>","<a href=\"http://cyberghost.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=10&aff_id=1420&source=ProxyServices\">CyberGhost</a>","<a href=\"https://secure.switchkonnect.com/pass.php#a_aid=9d1e79c9 \">SwitchVPN</a>","<a href=\"https://www.overplay.net?a_aid=toptenreviews&a_bid=3ea62643\">OverPlay</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3aae70ca-f28b-4868-9d20-06058d5c21ec","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_983","url":"/best-proxy-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"renee-shipley","url":"/author/renee-shipley","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Renee Shipley","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"cpCqrZTJSs2JQonabWSzN7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-08-28T15:32:31Z","datePublished":"2016-05-07T22:28:33Z","name":"Best Proxy Services","synopsis":"A proxy service can help you protect your data and privacy while browsing the web and transferring information.","review":{},"strapline":"A proxy service can help you protect your data and privacy while browsing the web and transferring information.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-10-13T00:00:00Z","id":"qf5ZTmdGwG9C7oioWdsYrE","meta":{"title":"Best Proxy Services 2018 -
