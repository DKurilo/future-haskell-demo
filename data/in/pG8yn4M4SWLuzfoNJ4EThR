Much of this decision hinges upon the rates and fees that credit card companies charge merchants. What percentage do credit card companies charge the merchant is a question that anyone interested in expanding his or her small business should ask. The merchant must pay  other fees, but the percentage paid to the credit card company per transaction is one of the most important issues for a merchant who is looking for a credit card company.","In addition to the percentage that a credit card company takes for each transaction, many charge flat fees for each processed credit card transaction. The amount varies but usually falls between 10 and 25 cents. Merchants are commonly charged monthly fees as well. All of these fees may scare a small business owner from the prospect of starting a merchant account with a credit card company, but it is possible to find the proper payment structure for almost any business.","For instance, a business that processes many small purchases throughout the day is best suited for a payment structure that includes a very low flat-rate payment per transaction. While the percentage-based fee may be higher, smaller transactions result in smaller percentage-based fees. A business that relies on occasionally processing large payments should search for a credit card company that offers low percentages for processing transactions.","Credit card companies offer merchants different rates based upon the amount of transactions they normally receive. An enormous retailer such as Target or Best Buy is likely to receive much lower percentages due to the high number of sales, while a small business will be charged a higher percentage. This is because most small businesses are deemed a high risk because of the limited amount of business transactions.","It is entirely possible to search for the best rates suitable for a specific business, but many credit card companies charge additional fees. A common example of these are batch fees, which are payments made to credit card companies when all of the completed transactions have been sent to a bank to complete the payment process. Another is a statement fee, which is a payment for the cost of overhead. Some credit card companies charge an annual fee to their merchant accounts as well, and the price of this fee ranges dramatically.","While the cost of owning a merchant account tied to a credit card company is expensive, the benefits will outweigh the costs. The average increase in sales a business receives after making credit card payments available is enormous, and can reach as high as a 400 percent. The amount credit card companies charge the merchant ranges, so it is possible to find a credit card company that offers a payment structure that is suitable for almost any small business."]},"id":"50fced6a-2119-42e4-b44a-537fe055cb61","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5693","url":"/what-do-credit-card-companies-charge-merchants","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"thomas-reynolds","url":"/author/thomas-reynolds","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Thomas Reynolds","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"AymTE9mL6hPDppuojPk3bm","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-03-31T20:11:19Z","datePublished":"2011-03-31T20:11:19Z","name":"What Do Credit Card Companies Charge Merchants?","synopsis":"Businesses without a merchant account tied to a credit card company lose many sales because some customers are unable to pay, but it can be difficult to decide which credit card processing company is","review":{},"strapline":"Businesses without a merchant account tied to a credit card company lose many sales because some customers are unable to pay, but it can be difficult to decide which credit card processing company is","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-09-15T19:31:25Z","id":"pG8yn4M4SWLuzfoNJ4EThR","meta":{"title":"What Do Credit Card Companies Charge Merchants?","description":"This article explains some of the fees and rates credit card companies charge merchants."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:56:26Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/sJWiWhVpaYBSvKHMFWBLgM.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:56:26Z","mimeType":"","name":"5693-what-do-credit-card-companies-charge-merchants-.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5693-what-do-credit-card-companies-charge-merchants-.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:56:26Z","id":"sJWiWhVpaYBSvKHMFWBLgM","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sJWiWhVpaYBSvKHMFWBLgM.jpg","alt":""},"title":"What Do Credit Card Companies Charge Merchants?","description":"This article explains some of the fees and rates credit card companies charge merchants."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/sJWiWhVpaYBSvKHMFWBLgM.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:56:26Z","mimeType":"","name":"5693-what-do-credit-card-companies-charge-merchants-.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5693-what-do-credit-card-companies-charge-merchants-.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:56:26Z","id":"sJWiWhVpaYBSvKHMFWBLgM","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sJWiWhVpaYBSvKHMFWBLgM.jpg","alt":""},"title":"What Do Credit Card Companies Charge Merchants?","description":"This article explains some of the fees and rates credit card companies charge merchants."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/business/articles/what-do-credit-card-companies-charge-merchants/","label":"","tags":[]}
