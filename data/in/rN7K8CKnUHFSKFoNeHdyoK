Amazingly, it remains priced at $299.99 which puts it in direct competition with leading devices such as the <a href=\"/apple-iphone-3g-16-gb-23036-review\">Apple iPhone 3G</a>, <a href=\"/blackberry-9000-23534-review\">BlackBerry Bold</a>, and even HTC’s own <a href=\"/htc-america-inc-touchproblkspt-24120-review\">Touch Pro</a> and <a href=\"/htc-america-inc-fuzeblkatt-25053-review\">Fuze</a>. Unfortunately, for the Wing, it is seriously outclassed by any of those devices in terms of performance and features.","<strong>Standout Features</strong>"]},"id":"9ae8c236-7de3-49bb-b9b2-c734f8ab26a6","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Touch Screen and QWERTY Keyboard","Windows Mobile 6.0 Operating System","Touch Screen, Slide-Out Keyboard"],"type":"ul"},"id":"975c70d6-ffdd-417d-920f-a73c6258b46a","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The T-Mobile Wing is dominated by its 2.8-inch diagonally measured touch screen with 240 x 320 pixel resolution. The display is attractive and easy to read but is outdated. Additionally, there is a very usable full QWERTY physical keyboard which slides open. Opening the keyboard automatically changes the display orientation from portrait to landscape, though there is generally an annoying delay in making the change. That sluggishness is actually representative of the device’s greatest shortfall…with just a 201MHz processor and 64MB of RAM, it’s simply underpowered for what it is trying to accomplish.","The lethargy continues when using the device for web surfing or transferring files. The Wing lacks 3G capability. Working on the EDGE data network you can only expect download speeds of around 90Kbps compared to 400Kbps to 700Kbps on 3G.  The phone is equipped with Wi-Fi which offers a high speed data connection option where available. Still, the phone comes equipped with Microsoft Direct Push which will provide real time corporate email using MS Exchange. It also features automatic synchronization of MS Outlook applications. Personal POP3 and IMAP email services are supported but are not delivered as true push email; rather, the device checks for mail every fifteen minutes which may produce the illusion of push service. Windows Mobile 6 supports HTML email so you have access to features like live hyperlinks and formatting options.","<strong>Multimedia Package</strong>","T-Mobile’s Wing is equipped with a 2.0-megapixel camera with 8x zoom and a video recording capability. There is no flash included. The device supports several audio and video file types. It has neither standard 3.5mm headphone jack nor support for stereo Bluetooth so you’re stuck with using the proprietary ear buds or using an adapter for headphones.","<strong>Battery</strong>","Rated talk time for the Wing is 270 minutes while standby time is an estimated 72 hours.","<strong>Design</strong>","In addition to the prominent touch screen, the Wing’s look is distinguished by its distinctive midnight blue color and rubbery finish. It’s somewhat bulky compared to other smartphones, even those with slide-out keyboards.","The T-Mobile Wing isn’t a bad device but it doesn’t compare favorably to the best devices. Inexplicably, its price places it in direct competition with the market leaders disqualifying it as a contender."]},"id":"f589c08f-387c-4749-a6b1-00fcc5462040","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_15779","url":"/t-mobile-usa-cnett-mobilewing-13212-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-02-13T07:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-02-13T07:00:00Z","name":"T-Mobile Wing CNETT-MobileWing","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":29,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-04-27T20:30:45Z","id":"rN7K8CKnUHFSKFoNeHdyoK","meta":{"title":"T-Mobile Wing Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
