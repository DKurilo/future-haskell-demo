The best units will always achieve greater performance from less fuel, for greater savings and efficiency in your home operation. The Winchester W9M is a device that sets itself apart from many other sub-par furnaces due to its dual-heat-exchange system, which is designed to extract as much heat as possible without increasing fuel consumption.","The Winchester W9M is the epitome of high-efficiency furnaces, achieving a 95.5 percent AFUE rating, only a couple percent less than the highest-rated units in the world. It achieves this through its use of a dual-heat exchanger made up of primary and secondary chambers. The primary heat exchanger is made up of high-tech, tubular, aluminized steel, whereas the secondary heat exchanger is stainless steel. The first chamber absorbs the majority of heat, with the second drawing out any remaining residual heat. The design of the heat exchanger ensures the furnace is able to get as much heat as possible at the expense of very little gas expended.","The direct drive blower on the Winchester W9M is designed with a multi-speed mechanism. This allows you to affect the rate of airflow taking place within your ventilation system if you need to more quickly heat up your home or workspace. In addition to being maintenance-free, the heating furnace’s blower is also permanently lubricated and requires no maintenance during the product’s life span.","This is one of the best furnaces in terms of technical requirements. The unit itself is quite compact, requiring just under three square feet of space for installation. It offers a multi-positional design for even greater flexibility of position. For proper installation, the furnace requires a half-inch input to gas valve, a dedicated circuit breaker and 120-volt wiring. With each of these requirements met, the device comes with a five-year parts warranty and lifetime heat-exchanger warranty for residential applications.","In addition to being among the most efficient of gas furnaces on the market, the Winchester W9M also makes a name for itself with its powerful direct drive blower. Whether your home is 1000 square feet or 4000, this unit will quickly and comfortably increase the temperature and keep you warm each day. The best part about this is that it won’t increase your utility bills as a result."]},"id":"8609f6ef-f30b-4917-8fe6-7a0b05d683e9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59565","url":"/winchester-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-20T13:40:39Z","datePublished":"2014-05-20T13:40:39Z","name":"Winchester W9M","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
