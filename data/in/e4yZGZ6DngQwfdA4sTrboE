You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD proves that <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphones </a>don&#39;t have to be weak and fragile. In addition to its sturdy and durable design, the phone makes surfing the web and downloading apps a fluid and smooth experience, comparable to a desktop computer.","The Droid Razr Maxx HD is built like a tank. Cased in DuPont Kevlar and Corning Gorilla Glass, this smartphone can take falls and scratches without any noticeable damage. It is also water-resistant, so if you&#39;re stuck in heavy rain, this phone will still be able to take and send phone calls. This tough design makes the phone heavier than most others, weighing just under 6 ounces.","When taking pictures, the 8MP rear camera on the Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD cannot deliver consistent pictures. Outdoors during the day, the pictures are clear and beautiful, but indoors or at night, the images are often grainy or pixilated. Fortunately, what the phone lacks in a camera, it makes up for with its 720p HD 4.7-inch screen. Movies and HD video are beautiful and clear. Thanks to its bright screen, you&#39;ll forget that you&#39;re watching your favorite shows on a small screen.","This phone has minimal call issues. It connects with Bluetooth devices and maintains a clear signal from several yards away. The speaker makes this phone great for conference calls, and the noise-cancelling microphone ensures that heavy winds won&#39;t interrupt your conversation. At times, the phone has issues connecting with its towers, and you may have to &#34;Lion King&#34; and search for a clear signal.","The standout feature of the Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD is its impressive battery life. When watching HD videos, the phone will support up to 13 hours of viewing. Typically, you&#39;ll be able to use this phone to stream music all day without needing to plug in to your charger. This powerful battery complements the 32GB of internal storage, 26GB of which are available for you to download and keep files. If this is too little, you can use memory cards to expand the storage.","The Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD comes equipped with Android 4.0 and several useful apps, like a new YouTube app that downloads selected videos to make buffer times a thing of the past and the new Android Beam that lets you share information between phones with a tap of the screen. You can upgrade to Android 4.1 if you&#39;d like the newest operating system. All of this is supported by a quad-core processor, working at 1.5GHz. This keeps your phone cool while working as fast as some computers."]},"id":"a6b44f21-bb4c-492f-bfed-2863ee4d2fb2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"daab1234-da95-4ffd-b09b-ece7448b0e3d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD is a workhorse in smartphone form.
