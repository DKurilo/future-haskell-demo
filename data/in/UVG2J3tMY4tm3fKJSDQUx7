If you don’t document your personal ancestry, who will? We recommend using Mixbook&#39;s “A Book of Remembrance” layout to place text and photos next to each other. For example, if your great-great uncle served in WWII and you have copies of his military documents, you could create a two page spread with an image showing him in his military uniform on one side of the page and the documents on the other. In the space between you can tell personal accounts from his life or of his honors in the military. If you are lucky to have access to a lot of history, break it up into volumes and have them printed periodically. These will make great gifts for siblings, parents, grandparents and grandchildren."]},"id":"ae22b267-6ac6-4589-b1df-407ec77c393f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Grandparent&#39;s Tales"},"id":"5d473b02-1b77-48d9-8b35-739aca7a277d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/3WL9r85oQZjNeVBWJXVN4V.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/R/N/808403/original/Grandparents-Tales-Edited.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3WL9r85oQZjNeVBWJXVN4V.jpg","credit":"Image Credit: Shutterstock","align":"","id":"3WL9r85oQZjNeVBWJXVN4V","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3WL9r85oQZjNeVBWJXVN4V.jpg","alt":""},"id":"63169165-9420-4c29-b752-e79e4f759159","type":"image"},{"data":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"bestof","data-model-name":"Mixbook"},"source":"hawk","embedtype":"unknown"},"id":"f7e3465f-aaf4-4356-9375-b74dce60c75f","type":"embed"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can help celebrate your grandparents’ lives by interviewing them and adding their stories and personal histories to a full-fledged photo book.

These kinds of books can also be a source of comfort as people talk about the experiences their loved one went through.
