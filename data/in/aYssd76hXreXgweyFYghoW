It achieves this through an energy-efficient and eco-friendly motor and lighting kit that greatly reduce wattage without reducing air circulation. With its balanced design, quiet motor and nine blades, this is a fan that ensures adequate distribution of hot and cool air alike no matter the season.","This is one of the best ceiling fans with lights because it is designed for the greatest level of eco-friendliness and energy efficiency. Energy efficiency a primary concern of many homes, and this top ceiling fan is designed to consume up to 70 percent less energy than other fans. It operates with nine individual blades that create an 84-inch blade sweep. The included LED array is designated for 14 watts, which provides significant advantages over traditional fluorescent lighting kits both in terms of lifespan and brightness. Due to its DC motor design and integrated LED lighting system, the fan consumes less electricity than other options, achieving 32 watts at the highest fan speed. Couple this consumption with its incredible airflow level of 11,190 cubic feet of air per minute, this fan achieves an airflow efficiency of 348 cubic feet per minute per watt, more than triple the industry average. This helps the fan qualify for Energy Star certification.","The provided downrod is six inches in length and one inch wide, and creates little wobble when installed tightly. The design of the quiet ceiling fanâ€™s motor and the balancing of its nine blades ensures steady operation with little audible output. With the lighting kit and downrod installed, this fan is nearly 18 inches in length, which means it should be installed on ceilings a minimum of 9 feet high. You can install the Odyn in outdoor areas as well as indoors. While high airflow is great for large spaces, it&#39;s too much for small rooms. Fanimation offers an excellent lifetime warranty on the Odyn&#39;s motor.","However, this fan is bit more expensive than most of the others we looked at, such as the <a href=\"/hunter-palermo-review\">Hunter Palermo</a>. This is disappointing considering some user reviews we found online said the build quality wasn&#39;t necessarily worth the price, particularly because the unit&#39;s blades are made of plastic."]},"id":"83e4d0e8-ae6b-49f0-a0ee-66155c098c7d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66303","url":"/fanimation-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-22T17:02:16Z","datePublished":"2015-07-22T17:02:16Z","name":"Fanimation Odyn","synopsis":"The Fanimation Odyn is a nine-bladed ceiling fan designed for high levels of airflow, all while consuming fractional levels of electricity in comparison to other models.","review":{"verdict":"The Fanimation Odyn is a unique and powerful ceiling fan that achieves incredible levels of airflow performance.","pros":["The Fanimation Odyn has the highest airflow among fans we evaluated."],"cons":["This massive fan is too big for small rooms."]},"strapline":"The Fanimation Odyn is a nine-bladed ceiling fan designed for high levels of airflow, all while consuming fractional levels of electricity in comparison to other models.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-06-05T00:00:00Z","id":"aYssd76hXreXgweyFYghoW","meta":{"title":"Fanimation Odyn Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Fanimation Odyn is a unique and powerful ceiling fan that achieves incredible levels of airflow performance."},"products":[{"slug":"fanimation-odyn","url":"/product/fanimation-odyn","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:27:00Z","name":"Fanimation Odyn","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:27:00Z","id":"WcBXk2sZMiPEtqeH4jGPuP","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:27:00Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/kKXd8UhD7GMjhGnzJwupNG.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:27:00Z","mimeType":"","name":"09a72487ff083f06854818f0ba8cde1c.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/09a72487ff083f06854818f0ba8cde1c.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:27:00Z","id":"kKXd8UhD7GMjhGnzJwupNG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKXd8UhD7GMjhGnzJwupNG.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Fanimation Odyn Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Fanimation Odyn is a unique and powerful ceiling fan that achieves incredible levels of airflow performance."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/kKXd8UhD7GMjhGnzJwupNG.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:27:00Z","mimeType":"","name":"09a72487ff083f06854818f0ba8cde1c.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/09a72487ff083f06854818f0ba8cde1c.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:27:00Z","id":"kKXd8UhD7GMjhGnzJwupNG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKXd8UhD7GMjhGnzJwupNG.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Fanimation Odyn Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Fanimation Odyn is a unique and powerful ceiling fan that achieves incredible levels of airflow performance."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/hvac/best-ceiling-fans/fanimation-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:27:00Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:27:00Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"air-conditioning","url":"/home-and-garden/air-conditioning","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:27:00Z","name":"Air Conditioning","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:27:00Z","id":"pVrs4zPdxV4QVcV5FoWtAd","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
