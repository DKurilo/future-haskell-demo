Excited, I headed out to lunch, ready to ask it all sorts of questions on the journey. I thought I’d start with something easy: “Okay Google, play my EDM playlist.”","This should have been a simple request, since I use Google Play Music every day and listen to my playlist titled “EDM” often. The app knows it and keeps it within easy reach at all times, so somewhere in the plethora of metadata Google has accumulated on me, it knows I like this playlist.","As expected, Google Assistant cheerily responded, “Okay!” It opened Play Music and started a playlist. But there was one problem: The playlist wasn’t mine. The assistant completely ignored my library of songs, instead hopping into the ether to find a random EDM playlist someone else had put together. Figuring that issues were to be expected, I tossed it another softball and asked, “Okay Google, what song is this?”","“I’m sorry, Dan, I can’t do that yet.”","Playing around with Google Assistant is a near-endless procession of experiences like this. Sometimes you get magical functionality. You feel like you could ask the phone anything and it would know the answer. Then you ask it to do something simple, something you could manage yourself with two taps of the finger, and it fails. The illusion falls apart. For an AI that supposedly has access to a staggering wealth of knowledge about its users, it’s bizarrely incapable of tapping into that knowledge to make your life a little easier.","Will Google Assistant eventually be everything we want it to be? Most assuredly. Right now, you can make reservations at a local restaurant through OpenTable; someday, you’ll be able to snap a photo and have it post to your Facebook timeline, complete with a grammatically correct comment, without ever touching the screen. But until then, it’s really not all that much better than Siri or Cortana, whatever Sundar Pichai might hope."]},"id":"73ecd9ea-cc2b-4b6c-aa59-8cc592b8ce3f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0318f312-1548-47c6-9b20-7662f3f24640","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The only real caveat that should keep you from buying a Pixel XL is the cost. Google has priced its first true flagship phone against Apple’s and Samsung’s latest and greatest devices, and for many of us, that expense can be all too difficult to swallow, even accounting for monthly payment programs.","Yet whether you’re a gadget lover, a camera aficionado or just someone who really likes Google, there’s simply too much here that’s great to not fall instantly in love. The Pixel XL takes everything that’s wonderful about smartphones in general, and Android in particular, and purifies it.","True, it’s not perfect yet. Google Assistant’s iffy responses and the lack of waterproofing are definitive knocks. But someone told Google they had to go big or go home, and Google swaggered its way up to the plate with determination in one hand and the world’s best Android smartphone in the other."]},"id":"51aca91c-1bb0-4ec3-892d-380a3f821084","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68693","url":"/google-pixel-xl-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-02T15:21:55Z","datePublished":"2016-11-02T15:21:55Z","name":"Google Pixel XL","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
