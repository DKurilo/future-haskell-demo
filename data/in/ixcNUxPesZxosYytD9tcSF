You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Staples XRX 9.5&#34; Thermal &amp; Cold <a href=\"/best-laminators\">Laminator</a> works with several document sizes and has three temperature settings that can be used for both thermal and pressure lamination. It features a release lever to remove jammed or misfed documents as well. This machine is missing a few basic features, though, like auto-shutoff and heat technology that keeps the device cool to the touch during use.","This laminating machine fits documents as wide as 6 to 10 inches, providing adequate room for several shapes and sizes to be used. It is also capable of laminating photos. Instead of film, the machine works with pouches, with a maximum thickness of 5 millimeters. This means you can use the machine to laminate temporary and foldable items, as well as more permanent ones.","There are three temperature settings on the laminator. When laminating, the device can be set to either hot or cold, depending on the type of document you are laminating. The heat setting will allow the two-roller machine to seal the edges of the pouch to laminate the document or photo using a high temperature. The second setting is for cold lamination, which uses pressure instead of heat to seal the pouches. The third setting is a cool-down setting, which lets you choose the temperature you want the machine to cool down to after the lamination process is complete.","The laminating machine can take five minutes or more to warm up before it can be used. When it has warmed up enough for use, a ready light will come on to let you know. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t have heat technology that prevents the exterior from becoming hot during use. This means the exterior may be hot to the touch until the machine is powered down or allowed to cool. This is where the cool-down setting is useful. Once set, the device will automatically cool down after you laminate each pouch.","This laminator is missing a couple of key features, including an auto-shutoff function to keep the machine from overheating and technology to prevent misfeeds from occurring. It does feature the cool-down setting, which can keep the machine at a cooler temperature until it is turned off. It also has a reverse function that can be used if you experience a jammed or misfed document.","While this home laminating machine doesn&#39;t have auto-shutoff or heat technology, it does offer a wide laminating width, a maximum pouch thickness of 5 millimeters and a reverse function. It also lets you use both hot and cold technology to laminate a variety of documents and photos."]},"id":"c2f3f899-60fc-4df7-82f1-6ee03b1770da","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63391","url":"/staples-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-10T20:59:36Z","datePublished":"2015-03-10T20:59:36Z","name":"Staples XRX 9.5\" Thermal & Cold","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-10T20:59:36Z","id":"ixcNUxPesZxosYytD9tcSF","meta":{"title":"Staples XRX 9.5\" Thermal & Cold Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Staples XRX 9.5&quot; Thermal &amp; Cold Laminator has three temperature settings and a quick laminating speed.
