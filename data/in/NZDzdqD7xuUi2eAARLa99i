Such is the case with its Mac encryption software, MEO. The software is simple, straightforward and secure. It loses some points in our review for lacking the AES encryption standard, opting instead for DES and Blowfish. That aside, it earns a place on our side-by-side comparison of the best Mac encryption products available.","MEO&#39;s main interface houses its three primary features â€“ Encrypt a Files, Encrypt and Email, and Decrypt a File. These options are self-explanatory; this simplicity is arguably MEO&#39;s most compelling asset. When you select Encrypt a File, a wizard takes over most of the work, leaving you to simply name the encryption folder, choose a password and select the encryption standard. It all takes less than a minute.","There are two ways to decrypt a file with MEO, and which one you use depends on how you encrypted the file. This Mac encryption software gives you the option to create a self-extracting file. This means that you don&#39;t need MEO to decrypt it, only a password. If you select this option, you&#39;ll be prompted to enter a password for that particular encryption volume. If you don&#39;t select this option, you need to have the software on hand. You simply select the Decrypt a File option from the main menu and follow the wizard. Again, very simple.","File encryption is only as strong as the password. One of the things we really like about MEO is the fact that it offers a password-strength detector. It doesn&#39;t offer a password generator or offer suggestions for secure passwords like some other products we reviewed. However, the simple strength analysis goes a long way toward helping users craft secure passwords.","If everyone knew how insecure sending unencrypted email is, drastically fewer emails would be sent. NCH understands this and has equipped MEO with a tool to encrypt your emails before you send them. This is a great tool because it provides a bulwark against intruders who may have phished a password to the account you&#39;re sending an email to. Additionally, sometimes emails are sent to wrong addresses by mistake. There are a million reasons to encrypt your emails. Whatever your reasons, MEO has you covered."]},"id":"0645734e-3d58-4c4d-8dd3-d1ffd31a6fb1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e100086d-6d7f-4e46-9921-34f21e89710d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At the end of the day, MEO is solid Mac encryption software.
