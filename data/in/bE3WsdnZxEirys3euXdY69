We understand the value of homemade videos and the cherished moments they contain, and we know how important it is to keep them safe. In our research, we read manufacturer websites, contacted them with questions, examined new products within the industry and, most importantly, did hands-on testing to see if the marketing claims were backed by performance by each model we selected to test.","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We invested more than 40 hours testing VHS to DVD converters, examining both the hardware and software that comprises each model we chose to test. We captured VHS content from a 40-minute VHS tape, tried the various editing tools that were included with each model and timed such things as how long it took to burn a DVD. We noted the various capabilities of each product, gave each a score and used our own methodology to calculate how we would rank each one. We also relied on our own experience with this kind of hardware and software to evaluate somewhat subjective things such as how easy each product was to use and the quality of the final DVD we made. In addition, we took into account how much customer support you can expect and how easy, or difficult, it is to get in contact with a company if you encounter a problem. From what we learned, especially from the testing, we produced a numerically ranked lineup of products that can help you choose the best VHS to DVD converter for your purposes.","<strong>How Long Do VHS Tapes Last?</strong>","If you&#39;re thinking about converting your VHS tapes to DVDs, don&#39;t delay. Over time, VHS tapes start to decay, thus lowering the video quality. In some cases, this deterioration can even prevent you from converting home videos to DVDs. According to <a href=\"https://www.scancafe.com/image-preservation/videotape-decay\">ScanCafe</a>, a company that offers photo- and video-converting services, VHS tapes begin to deteriorate after 10 to 25 years. Considering the last time a major studio released a movie on VHS was over a decade ago, in 2006, your home videos have likely already begun to deteriorate. If you don’t have the time or the equipment to digitize them yet, be careful about how you store them. Tapes kept in cool, dry locations are more likely to preserve longer, while tapes left in humid or extremely cold locations will probably deteriorate faster. The sooner you digitize your videos, the better they’ll be preserved. <br/><strong><br/>Things to Look for in a VHS to DVD Converter </strong><br/><br/>Capture &amp; Customize<br/>The best VHS to DVD converters not only let you move your video content to a DVD, but let you do it quickly and easily. We tested the hardware and software in each model we chose, and the first-rate models are intuitive and offer quite helpful editing options. These can actually enhance the quality of your original VHS material so it looks polished and professional. Some converters also can get past the copyright protections in commercially made VHS tapes so you can preserve your favorite movies, concerts, workout regimens and documentaries.","Output<br/>We tested converters by capturing the content of an old videotape and then burning it to a DVD, checking to see how long this process took. After that, we looked closely at the audio and visual quality of the resulting DVD, which helped us score and rank the products we examined. Along with the VHS to DVD transfer, we also noted whether an application lets you make stand-alone video files to use on a computer, upload to social media or enjoy on mobile devices.","How Much Do VHS to DVD Converters Cost?<br/>VHS to DVD converters can cost anywhere between $30 and $80. Our top pick was the cheapest one we reviewed, so you definitely don’t have to spring for the most expensive to get the best product.","Help &amp; Support<br/>Sometimes making these video transfers, burning DVDs or undertaking other tasks with these programs can be a bit tricky. We looked for solid customer support to help you if any difficulties arise and gave top marks to companies that provide the most comprehensive assistance via phone, email, FAQs or a knowledgebase, and live chat."]},"id":"c56752f7-a88a-422e-8bf7-863c83d8a14c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_226","url":"/best-vhs-to-dvd-converters","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-23T21:22:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-23T21:22:00Z","name":"Best VHS to DVD Converters of 2019","synopsis":"In addition to burning your tapes to DVD, Roxio Easy VHS to DVD 3 Plus also allows you to share your converted footage to YouTube directly from the program.
