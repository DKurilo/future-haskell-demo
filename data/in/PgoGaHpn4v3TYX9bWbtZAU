In addition to multiple downrods and a lighting kit, it comes with a handheld controller to manage the fan’s speed settings. The device is protected by a lifetime motor warranty.","This ceiling fan has five cherry-finished blades that span 52 inches. The fan is capable of circulating air in rooms up to 20 square feet in size, and it moves air around at a speed of 6,500 cubic feet per minute on its highest setting. This is an above-average amount of air movement for a fan this size. On its highest setting, it requires 70 watts of electricity to run, giving it an efficiency rating of 92 cubic feet per minute per watt. This fan is not Energy Star certified.","Hampton Bay’s Savona fan has a single motor that makes 175 rotations per minute. You can reverse the motor, allowing you to run the fan both during the summer and winter. You can also switch between three speed settings with the provided remote control. It&#39;s worth noting that this is one of the few ceiling fans we looked at that includes a remote, another is the <a href=\"/hunter-palermo-review\">Hunter Palermo</a>. Hampton Bay is one of Home Depot&#39;s exclusive brands, which means you need get customer support through a specialized section on Home Depot&#39;s website.","The best ceiling fans with lights have style, and this unit comes with an art deco Tiffany glass cover for its lighting kit. This is a pan-style lighting kit that can be used on low ceilings. Unlike some other fans, this one cannot be installed without the lighting kit.<br/>You can mount the fan flush to the ceiling or use either a 4- or 6-inch downrod. The fan has a compact design and is only 11 inches tall without the downrods. In addition to the standard mounting kit, it comes with angle mounting hardware for vaulted ceilings. The inclusion of multiple downrods make this fan versatile and convenient to use."]},"id":"7b9104fa-c4f4-49d8-9d5c-60fff75d270c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66304","url":"/hampton-bay-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-22T17:02:27Z","datePublished":"2015-07-22T17:02:27Z","name":"Hampton Bay Savona","synopsis":"The Hampton Bay Savona is a stylish and reliable ceiling fan that comes equipped with all the hardware you need to both install and use it regularly.
