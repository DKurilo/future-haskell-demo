Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Fujifilm is recognized as one of the leaders in the photography industry, but the Fujifilm Finepix XP170 falls short in the waterproof camera category. This <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">waterproof camera</a> has a fun and sporty design, but the image quality under some lighting conditions is not quite up to par. Additionally, the features, like Wi-Fi synching, just don&#39;t measure up.","The Fujifilm FinePix XP170 is not as durable as other waterproof cameras. In our testing of the Fujifilm FinePix, it did not survive being underwater for more than an hour. The camera is highly water resistant but not waterproof. We wouldn’t recommend taking this digital camera to the ocean, lake or pool to submerge. It might be safe in the rain or snow, but avoid getting the camera too wet, and make sure to completely dry it off after it gets wet. You may want to use an airtight camera case and float strap when using it in water.","The FinePix XP30 has 14 megapixels, a 5x wide-angle optical zoom and a quick 1/2000 second shutter speed. Like most Fujifilm cameras, it takes nice photographs. Even underwater photos are clear and have good white balance. However, the camera does not perform well in low light, and the autofocus tends to be slow in the daylight.","The Fujifilm FinePix XP170 sports a compact design. It is small enough to fit in your pocket, and it is tougher than an average point and shoot camera. It does not come with many color options though – only blue or orange.","The Fujifilm FinePix XP170 has a Wireless Image Transfer function, which allows you to sync your camera to your Apple or Android smartphone through its built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. You can download an app to sync your pictures from the FinePix XP170 to your device and share them through your phone. While the direct sharing is convenient, the feature has some bugs. The Wi-Fi can be difficult to set up, and the camera&#39;s Wi-Fi can sometimes lose its signal, requiring you to reset the connection to your smartphone.","A cool feature from this camera is the ability for it to take panoramic pictures, great for outdoorsy landscape pictures. This camera also has features like face detection and auto red-eye removal.","Fujifilm has excellent customer service. The FinePix XP170 is protected by a one-year limited warranty, so you can contact Fujifilm if your camera breaks or malfunctions. You can reach the company through email or telephone for questions about products and warranty information. Fujifilm also has FAQs and downloadable user guides for specific products online so you can view product specifications and other information."]},"id":"05e826f7-03f4-483b-87d0-f1f4cabbbb54","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"416d63ec-2887-4b7b-9e5b-a6fdbf5d2cf5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Fujifilm makes some great cameras, but the FinePix XP170 falls well short of expectations.
