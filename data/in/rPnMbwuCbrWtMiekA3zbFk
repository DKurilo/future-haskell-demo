This <a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">egg cooker</a> is dishwasher safe, so cleanup is simple. That said, we had less than stellar success making hard-cooked eggs with this kitchen appliance. After adding the water and putting four eggs into the slots, we cooked the eggs in a microwave oven and followed the instructions carefully.","The result of our cooking? Yolks with soft-cooked centers with a touch of medium-cooked yolk around the outside of the entire yolk. The whites were firm. If you like a somewhat soft and runny yolk, this isn’t a problem. We tried a second batch, again following the scant instructions in the tiny instruction booklet, and got the same thing. They tasted fine, but the eggs weren&#39;t cooked all the way through.","This is unfortunate since so many people who don&#39;t have conventional cooking facilities do have microwave ovens and would no doubt welcome eggs you can cook in a mere eight minutes. If you buy a Nordic Ware Microwave Egg Boiler, you&#39;ll need to experiment with cooking times if you like egg yolks cooked more completely. On a happier note, there&#39;s no need to experiment with water levels since the instructions tell you to put 1.5 cups of water into the bottom of his fun egg-shaped device, so there&#39;s no risk of too much water evaporating and burning the eggs.","The Nordic egg cooker is made of BPA- and melamine-free plastic, with an aluminum rack inside to hold the eggs. The cooker holds up to four eggs at a time. This cooker is produced within the USA, where Nordic closely monitors the materials and processes used. Its practices during production ensure that the cooker leaves as miniscule an eco-footprint as possible.","This device has no electronic components, since it heats while inside the microwave. Once the lid is in place, no metal is exposed during heating.","Weighing in at approximately a half-pound, this hard-boiled egg cooker measures 5.2 inches wide and 6 inches high, making it compact enough to store easily. The lightweight design also makes it easy to take along with you to work or during travel, and it would be a boon to anyone living in a dormitory. For more thoroughly cooked eggs, take a look at the electric <a href=\"/dash-go-review\">Dash Rapid Egg Cooker</a>.","There is no need to pierce the shell, thanks to the grooves of the perforated shelf in the cooker. You don&#39;t need hot water either to prepare eggs due to the layout of this simple machine&#39;s interior. When it&#39;s time to clean this gadget, you can place everything in the dishwasher. Nordic Ware also backs this egg cooker with a remarkably long five-year guarantee, which is unheard of in the egg cooker world."]},"id":"8351fbd9-e551-4679-9eac-1a71190e8cd4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63184","url":"/nordic-ware-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-03T19:10:29Z","datePublished":"2015-03-03T19:10:29Z","name":"Nordic Ware Egg Boiler","synopsis":"The Nordic Ware Egg Boiler lets you prepare soft- and hard-boiled eggs in your microwave in a compact, egg-shaped kitchen accessory.
