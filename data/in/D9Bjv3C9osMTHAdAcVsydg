However, it lacks almost all the mounting options we look for in devices in this category, which pushed it down in our rankings.","This is a self-leveling device, which makes the process much easier than using a bubble level. It produces straight lines within three seconds. You can move it around your project and preserve the straight lines. Like most self-leveling lasers, the Skil 8201-CL indicates when the line is not level; the laser beams will flash and the LED indicator light will turn red if the device is out of level.","The device has multiple settings for laser beam projection. You can set the laser to project horizontal or vertical lines one at a time or cross-line lasers that incorporate both horizontal and vertical projections. You can also set the laser to angle lines, which allows you to tilt the laser any angle you want without the indicator lights flashing. The level can project beams down both sides of a corner, on the floor and on the ceiling so that you don&#39;t have to move the laser all over the room for large-scale projects.","At 30 feet, the laser level projects clear beams with a height accuracy of a quarter inch. This is a relatively good projection distance for laser line levels. The products we reviewed ranged from 16 feet to <a href=\"/craftsman-review\">100 feet</a>, with the majority maxing out at 30 feet.","The base has a clear hole that attaches it to a tripod, and the simplified buttons make it easy to set your laser beams. While it includes a tripod, itâ€™s not of top quality. And although the level can accommodate angled lines, the tripod cannot mount the device at an angle."]},"id":"8262ccdd-444c-4dd4-87ff-3258e7dce587","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"16568c61-2cf1-4a21-a7aa-7beb3985b6a2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Skil 8201-CL is a quality laser line level that can support small and large projects.
