Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer fits into our top ten lineup. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Motorola L404 is a <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">cordless phone</a> with some basic functions, a powerfully long talk time and the excellent clarity provided by DECT 6.0 technology. However, there are a few drawbacks, including the fact that you can add only one more handset to the four that are standard with the purchase.","The handsets of the Motorola L404 offer speakerphone and caller ID capabilities, but unfortunately, you cannot do telephone conferencing with this cordless phone set. In addition, the keypads are not backlit, which could pose a problem if you need to make a call in low- or no-light conditions.","Each handset of the Motorola L404 boasts an impressive talk time of 12 hours per fully charged battery.","The only base feature the Motorola L404 retains is an integrated answering machine. This voicemail function is only accessible through the cordless phone’s handset, meaning that the answering machine capability generally found in a phone’s base is not present.","You get a skimpy battery life of 7.5 days, which is not too bad but not exceptional either. On the bright side, this phone can be charged in six to eight hours, which is quite fast in this industry. You receive 15 minutes of recorded message time.","You can adjust the ringer volume to one of six levels. The phone holds only five items in its redial memory, which is tiny compared to other phones, and you can store only 30 items in the phonebook and caller ID memory.","The one positive thing that the Motorola L404’s lack of features adds to the device is an increase in usability. With so few abilities and functions to learn, this cordless phone is one of the easiest-to-use products on our lineup. The buttons and menus are easy to navigate, and the layout is clean and simple. The only difficulty with the utilization of this device is its lack of convenient features.","If you run into difficulties with this cordless phone, you can always consult the user manual that is included with its purchase. There is also a FAQs section online. If you still cannot get the answers you need, you can make use of Motorola&#39;s email or telephone support."]},"id":"c85eaadf-2e26-4dd3-87e6-9b23bcaf964d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"53558726-7805-4f69-b74d-aca42c14f561","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We found the Motorola L404 to be lacking in a few key areas, though the cordless phone on the whole is quite functional.
