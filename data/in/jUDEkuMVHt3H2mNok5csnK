Chesney  Chet  Baker was introduced to music at an early age, but he could never concentrate on his passion fully since he was forced to work odd jobs to make ends meet during the Great Depression. Like his music during his younger years, Chet never fully concentrated on his studies either, and by age 16, he had decided that it was time to enlist in the U.S. Army. Ironically enough, this actually helped him as a musician since he joined 298th Army Band. Apparently, military life intrigued Chet, because he re-enlisted after a short stint in college, joining the Sixth Army Band in San Francisco."]},"id":"c2aaea42-1529-47a0-9fec-a30988c58c98","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/5tqhi6HpuRUw95uyW6EBWJ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"This event holds much significance because it is here that Chet really began to be introduced to the Bop scene, and jazz trumpet was all the better for it.

He moved to New York and returned to the style of straight jazz that had first made him famous. He redeveloped his embouchure, and after garnishing some success in the Big Apple, he moved to Europe where critically speaking he had the best years of his career. He recorded a number of tracks with smaller European labels that did not generally reach a mainstream audience but were nevertheless highly celebrated by the jazz faithful and critics alike.
