If we are able to in the future we will update the review. E*TRADE acquired OptionsHouse and has incorporated the OptionsHouse platform into its trading services.","A robo-advisor can be a good option if you want to invest but lack the time or desire to choose your own investments. E*TRADE’s Adaptive Portfolio offers a blend of algorithmic and human management. To sign up you’ll answer questions about your risk tolerance, investment goals and timeframe. Adaptive Portfolio requires a minimum deposit of $5,000 and has an annual advisory fee of 0.30%.","The cost to buy stocks online, as well as options and exchange-traded funds, is $6.95. If you make more than 30 trades per quarter, this prices drops to $4.95. Broker-assisted trades cost $25. To open an account, a minimum deposit of $500 is required. E*TRADE offers over 100 commission-free ETFs. These are a good option for novice investors, but remember that even though you won’t pay a commission, you’ll have to pay an annual expense fee which can range between 0.19% and 0.75%.","This online brokerage provides thorough educational resources on buying stocks online, including a retirement planning toolkit to help you plan investment strategies for your future. A key feature of the education center is the recorded webinars that cover a range of topics such as choosing the right retirement account and how diversifying your portfolio can benefit you. In addition to the webinars, the company provides investment guides, online investment courses, articles and live events at E*TRADE locations. The site also offers a simulated trading environment so you can practice on the platform and develop trading strategies.","E*TRADE combines solid pricing, excellent education offerings, a selection of commission-free ETFs and a hybrid robo-advisor.
