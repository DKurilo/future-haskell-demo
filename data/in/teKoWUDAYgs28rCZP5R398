This bike GPS also lacks the ability to provide a temperature reading and is not designed with a barometric altimeter. The features that you will find in this bicycle GPS unit include map reading abilities and display, turn-by-turn navigation, speed analysis and data for distance, time and calories burned.

With this card slot you can download and save maps to a microSD card or you can purchase a Garmin street map microSD card. For optimal results, the Garmin City Navigator microSD map card is highly encouraged. Through our research we found that other users were disappointed that they had to purchase a separate Garmin map card to download maps onto their unit. The card is somewhat costly so we recommend adding it into the cost of the Edge 605 before you decide if it is the right bike GPS for you.","Despite the additional costs required to more fully use and enjoy your Garmin Edge 605 bike GPS, it has an excellent design. It has a color display measuring 1.37 x 1.71 inches, which is  2.2 inches diagonally. It doesn’t have a touchscreen but instead is navigated by buttons on either side of the unit as well as directly beneath the display screen. It runs by the rechargeable li-polymer batteries and has an approximate battery life of 15 hours. The battery life does depend on how much you use the back light."]},"id":"fa331531-e8b2-4129-94e0-bf17828c7bdf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Interface"},"id":"74c673dd-1983-47df-9292-99c4bd67c243","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you have no prior experience using Garmin GPS products, it may take some time for you to get used to the Edge 605 bike GPS.
