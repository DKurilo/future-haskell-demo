This shift was implemented to encourage merchants to upgrade their <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a> equipment with EMV-certified card readers in order to reduce fraud occurring at the point of sale.","Even though merchants who continue to use the magnetic stripe card readers are now liable for any counterfeit fraud that occurs at their terminals, approximately 70 percent of American merchants haven&#39;t yet implemented EMV technology. This, despite that fact that over half of the credit cards in the U.S. are chip-enabled. Furthermore, that percentage is expected to rise to 97 percent by 2017.","The expense of converting to new terminals is holding some merchants back, but another issue is how long it takes the new terminals to read chip cards. It takes the terminal several seconds longer to read the chip than it takes to swipe a card, and as a result, it&#39;s introduced an awkward pause that annoys customers and clerks alike. It also slows the entire checkout process, a problem for businesses that depend on speed, such as coffee shops, or busy retailers during high-volume periods.","In April 2016, Visa and MasterCard announced new technologies to decrease EMV transaction time. Visa&#39;s Quick Chip and MasterCard&#39;s M/Chip Fast technologies cut what was sometimes as long as a 10-second wait (while the terminal warns you to not remove the card) to a two-to-four second wait more akin to the card swipe.","In essence, these innovations involve a software upgrade that prioritizes the security authentication process. One of the reasons the EMV chip is more secure than the magnetic stripe is that it sends a unique transaction code to the bank each time you insert the card. Visa and MasterCard&#39;s new software sends the code first so the customer can remove the card in about two seconds, and the terminal can handle the rest of the transaction independently.","This not only reduces the time customers spend watching the machine but makes it easier for them to remember their cards, as they can dip them in and out of the machine quickly. In time, it might mean the removal of the annoying alarm reminding customers to retrieve their cards, as customers won&#39;t have to let go of them.","While faster is usually better, MasterCard has suggested that not every business will find it worth their time to upgrade. If your customers aren&#39;t complaining about the wait, and your business doesn&#39;t hinge on moving people through the checkout line quickly, then this credit card company says don&#39;t worry about fixing something that isn&#39;t broken. Such businesses might be restaurants, where it&#39;s normal to have a delay between presenting your card and getting the receipt. Coffee shops or ticket booths, on the other hand, may find it worth the effort to upgrade.","EMV technology combats counterfeit fraud effectively and merchants who have upgraded to accept the chip have seen an overall decrease in fraud by 39 percent. However, customer dissatisfaction with EMV transaction times may cause merchants to question if upgrading is a good move for their business, despite the benefits. Quick Chip and M/Chip Fast remove this roadblock, enabling merchants to improve security while still providing their customers with a good checkout experience.","<em>Contributing writer: Karina Fabian</em>"]},"id":"c64504ba-03f6-40d2-823a-de011e28507f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10123","url":"/faster-emv-transactions","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"lori-fairbanks","url":"/author/lori-fairbanks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Lori Fairbanks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"p6N3q9MSBBLsV6BQ4Qpsyc","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-05T15:17:06Z","datePublished":"2016-10-05T15:17:06Z","name":"Visa & Mastercard - New Tech To Speed Up EMV Transaction Time?","synopsis":"October 2015 marked the transition of counterfeit fraud liability from the credit card companies to merchants.","review":{},"strapline":"October 2015 marked the transition of counterfeit fraud liability from the credit card companies to merchants.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-05T15:22:43Z","id":"H29z8MSNGZ5uvA8mY9QcsT","meta":{"title":"Visa & Mastercard - New Tech To Speed Up EMV Transaction Time?","description":"One of the drawbacks of EMV technology is how long it takes terminals to read chip cards.
