You can use them at office meetings to highlight important parts of presentations or at home as a high-tech toy for feline companions. Their powerful lights reach distant targets, pointing out objects for discussion without requiring any physical reach. A few laser pointers on the market are the <a href=\"#Quarton_INFINITER_2000_Green_Beam_Pointer\">Quarton INFINITER 2000 Green Beam Pointer</a>, the <a href=\"#Wicked_S3_Arctic_Laser\">Wicked S3 Arctic Laser</a> and the simple <a href=\"#Orion_Skyline_Deluxe\">Orion SkyLine Deluxe</a>.","These tools clarify topics in lecture halls, too. Both students and professors use laser pointers for educational purposes. They help just as much on hikes and tours; guides no longer need to use physical extensions to point out nearby plants or significant historical points. Laser pointers highlight the same information without any extra effort.","<strong>Laser Pointers: What to Look For</strong>","Depending on the situation, some laser pointers work better than others. When you need to point out constellations, a more powerful beam should be used to point toward the spot in the sky. Only a high power laser pointer creates this type of beam. When you want to distract a pet, you need far less power. Other factors, like the laser&#39;s color and the availability of accessories will also affect your decision.","<strong> Power Output</strong><br/>Laser pointers vary in many ways, but power output remains the most important to consider. High power levels, which you can measure in milliwatts (mW), create more vibrant looking beams. They reach further than their low-power counterparts and can sometimes ignite matches when pointed directly at them. These high-power laser pointers do not make safe choices for most simple tasks.","Lower power outputs still generate enough energy to shine a laser point across the room. They require less bulk to function, and they generate fewer milliwatts than more powerful laser pointers.","<strong>Laser Color</strong><br/>While red lasers remain the most common for use in homes, blue and green laser pointers are growing in popularity. These alternate laser colors come with higher power levels, and you can use them for long-range tasks. Green laser pointers work most effectively for astronomy classes, while red pointers handle many everyday tasks.","<strong>Range</strong><br/>Home laser pointers require a far shorter range than those needed for more intense activities. Long-range uses require a few additional features. For example, blue laser pointers usually collimate at a greater rate than red lasers. This ensures a focused point at further distances, which allows you to stand a greater distance from your target without losing precision.","<strong>Accessories</strong><br/>Home laser pointers sometimes come with alternate heads to alter the beam. These caps project lines, dots and simple images instead of the traditional pinpoint of a standard laser. Other laser pointer accessories include lanyards for better control and cases for protection during transport.","The right laser pointer depends on the task you are using it for. Long range jobs require lasers with higher levels of collimation. Tasks that require visible beams may require green laser pointers for night viewing, and everyday home tasks need lower power levels to ensure safety. Find out everything you need to know before choosing your next laser pointer."]},"id":"b7847072-b731-435f-ab9b-d3cae54ddada","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/n3k9DuAtyj9ueFoDnykj59.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/10250/best-laser-poin-1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n3k9DuAtyj9ueFoDnykj59.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"n3k9DuAtyj9ueFoDnykj59","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n3k9DuAtyj9ueFoDnykj59.jpg","alt":""},"id":"20c28b04-71ed-4fe1-9b2f-e337e4e02d1f","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The G301 Green Laser Pointer generates a powerful 5 milliwatt (mW) beam, and because of this power, it comes with a solid set of safety features.

You can use this laser pointer for outdoor light shows, indoor presentations and many long-distance tasks. The battery life serves as the unit&#39;s primary limitation, restricting performance to as little as a half hour in some situations.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong>Z-Bolt BTE-4S Red Laser Pointer Review</strong>"]},"id":"e273abe1-6806-4500-a442-8adcc8c96bf9","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/xieUNdBKWDaMDv6iDBBToE.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/10250/best-laser-poin-10.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xieUNdBKWDaMDv6iDBBToE.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"xieUNdBKWDaMDv6iDBBToE","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xieUNdBKWDaMDv6iDBBToE.jpg","alt":""},"id":"1c8f2d62-e69b-4245-8e23-7d9f9704b286","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Z-Bolt BTE-4S red laser pointer has moderate power output and can be seen for a long distance. It is easy to operate and comes with a small case for transport. It lacks the intensity needed for backyard astronomy but delivers enough range for many applications. The lack of safety features makes this laser a potentially hazardous tool for some homes.","This laser pointer functions as a Class IIIa device. It comes with a power level below 5 milliwatts (mW), so it aligns with standard regulations. This limits extra entertainment performance like popping balloons and lighting matches, but it does not restrict many everyday uses. You can shine this laser pointer across a brightly lit room and still see the powerful illumination point. It also easily displays on projection screens and walls.","The body of the device comes in a standard pen shape. It measures about 5.5 inches from one end to the other and uses a switch to turn on the power. This feature differentiates the Z-Bolt laser pointer from many other devices. The on-board switch allows you to turn the device on without having to hold down the button. When you run the laser pointer, the power can last up to 15 hours before shutting off by itself.","The power switch works as both a feature and as a safety limitation. This design allows you to run the laser pointer without having to hold it constantly, so you can set it down as you take notes or perform other activities nearby. This frees up your hands, but it also removes control over the device. Without constant attention, it is possible for the laser pointer to be misused and may damage the eyes.","The device comes in a carrying case for transport. This case stores both the laser pointer and the two AAA batteries that provide power to it. You can store the unit in the case to prevent damage, but the case does not come with any locking mechanism to prevent unauthorized access.","This laser pointer has a 4,500-foot range. The spot diameter measures just over 1 millimeter, and the beam does not flicker while powered on. The constant beam can help with hunting and other outdoor activities.","The Z-Bolt BTE-4S red laser pointer has constant power that can cover long distances. It works for indoor and outdoor tasks, and the case makes it easy to transport. While the beam&#39;s 5 milliwatt power fits within regulatory guidelines, the lack of safety features makes this red laser pointer a potential hazard around the house, especially with children nearby.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>"]},"id":"71871f67-7062-409c-8552-aa01515bb767","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10250","url":"/best-laser-pointers-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-18T20:59:43Z","datePublished":"2016-11-18T20:59:43Z","name":"Best Laser Pointers Review","synopsis":"Laser pointers serve several purposes.
