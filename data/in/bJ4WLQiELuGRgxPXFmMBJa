You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","HealthRider manufactures both recumbent and <a href=\"/best-exercise-bikes\">upright stationary bikes</a> that can help you improve your health and fitness. Each of these bikes has a console for viewing your workout statistics, and you use it to access preset workouts and application information. However, not all bikes offer the same features, so you want to look closely at each model to make sure it has the ones you are looking for.","The displays on most of the HealthRider stationary exercise bikes are very basic. Some products, such as the HealthRider H35Xr, have more detailed Graphixx Displays and are iFit compatible. Additionally, some of the stationary bikes come with built-in workout programs. These programs are designed by personal trainers to help you focus on specific fitness goals such as building resistance, burning fat and increasing performance. Other products made by the company only have one or two workout applications to help you keep your workouts fun and intense.","Like the other features, each of the company’s bikes come with different resistance levels. Some don’t allow you to adjust the resistance level at all, while others have up to 16 different resistance levels to choose from. The higher the resistance level, the more intense your workout is.","Several of these bikes have transportation wheels so you can move them around easily. Other products allow you to adjust the handlebars if needed. These bikes are durable and have a rider weight capacities ranging from 250 pounds to 300 pounds. The size and weight of each bike differs depending on the model you choose: recumbent or upright.","Additionally, some of HealthRider’s products include built-in sound systems and ports for your music player. You can buy machines with areas on the console where you can place a magazine or tablet to view while you work out. However, not all media fits on these book rests, and the bikes don’t have water bottle holders.","The warranty varies for each product. Some of the exercise bikes only include 90-day warranties, while others feature a five-year warranties. You should look closely at the warranty of each bike before you consider purchasing it."]},"id":"3222e3c3-f747-452d-8c57-6595e1d10f3a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57692","url":"/healthrider-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-04T11:41:18Z","datePublished":"2013-10-04T11:41:18Z","name":"HealthRider","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":75,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-10-04T11:41:18Z","id":"bJ4WLQiELuGRgxPXFmMBJa","meta":{"title":"HealthRider Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our write-up about HealthRider and see how its recumbent and upright bikes can improve your fitness."},"products":[{"slug":"healthrider","url":"/product/healthrider","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:39:04Z","name":"HealthRider","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:39:04Z","id":"ioqGLnZuUSKbVP4Z9JeFRo","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T23:39:04Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/bgAzXj2n2qjfu7Ejkvi9nc.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:39:04Z","mimeType":"","name":"1a57dee50151eafb77d4b493c4147832.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/1a57dee50151eafb77d4b493c4147832.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:39:04Z","id":"bgAzXj2n2qjfu7Ejkvi9nc","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgAzXj2n2qjfu7Ejkvi9nc.jpg","alt":""},"title":"HealthRider Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our write-up about HealthRider and see how its recumbent and upright bikes can improve your fitness."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/bgAzXj2n2qjfu7Ejkvi9nc.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:39:04Z","mimeType":"","name":"1a57dee50151eafb77d4b493c4147832.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/1a57dee50151eafb77d4b493c4147832.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:39:04Z","id":"bgAzXj2n2qjfu7Ejkvi9nc","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgAzXj2n2qjfu7Ejkvi9nc.jpg","alt":""},"title":"HealthRider Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our write-up about HealthRider and see how its recumbent and upright bikes can improve your fitness."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/health/fitness/best-exercise-bikes/healthrider-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"health-and-beauty","url":"/health-and-beauty","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:39:04Z","name":"Health & Beauty","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:39:04Z","id":"5johNE4w3ctxAug7oACGPh","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"fitness","url":"/health-and-beauty/fitness","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:39:04Z","name":"Fitness","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:39:04Z","id":"MiaGsmrkTbJRw5tXQgFZHk","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
