You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","All-in-one computers are gaining popularity due to their sleek non-cluttered design and space saving quality. The IdeaCentre Horizon Multimode fits that mold perfectly. This 27-inch widescreen all-in-one desktop has a 1920x1080 resolution, which makes it a good choice for watching movies. However, a higher resolution would have looked much better with the screen size.","One great feature about this <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-pc,review-2159.html\">home PC</a> is the 10-point touch screen functionality that allows multiple people to use it at once. Now you can play a game with your family or collaborate on a project with a coworker by simultaneously navigating around the PC.","This all-in-one desktop PC comes with an HDMI-in port, so you can watch movies and play video games by connecting the PC to a Blu-ray drive or a game console.","A big downside of this all-in-one desktop is that, although it has plenty of space, it only has two USB 3.0 ports, which makes it hard when you want to connect multiple devices to your PC. It also has an SD card reader so you can upload your photos right from your camera conveniently.","With the 720p HD webcam you can stay in touch with family in high definition and you can hold video conference calls remotely if you&#39;re on a business trip.","The hard drive can hold up to 1TB of space, so you can store work projects, movies, music and more on the PC comfortably without running out of space.","This home PC weighs in at around 18 pounds, but even though you might be able to lift it, it can be hard to move due to its large screen size.","If you run into issues with your new PC you can call or email technical support. However, if you have a pressing issue that requires immediate assistance, you can reach a sales representative through the live chat option located on the company website. There&#39;s also a one-year warranty included with this PC for added comfort."]},"id":"09815e9b-38d5-4724-a0eb-914606878d59","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"542bc1b6-5ebc-4ee2-adcf-c652c2bd4713","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The IdeaCentre Horizon Multimode is a decent all-in-one PC with a great widescreen and 10-point functionality that allows you to play games and interact with the touchscreen simultaneously with friends."]},"id":"4e2c832f-8b35-49f5-8c23-817e1e704ce3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58155","url":"/ideacentre-horizon-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"brian-westover","url":"/author/brian-westover","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Brian Westover","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"TBtnELo8v5XHxqU9uBG9c7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-14T03:04:15Z","datePublished":"2013-11-14T03:04:15Z","name":"IdeaCentre Horizon Multimode","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.
