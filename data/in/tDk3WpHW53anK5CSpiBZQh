This system connects under your sink and comes with an included faucet. The filters have a long lifespan, especially when compared to similar systems, and this water filtration system is covered under an impressive seven-year warranty. However, this water filter unit does have several areas where improvements can be made, which is why it falls short of the best water filter systems.","The AquaKinetic can reduce up to 14 contaminants from your drinking water. These contaminants include lead, chlorine, cysts and asbestos. These are important impurities to remove, but many similar water purification solutions can reduce more than 20 and even up to 80 contaminants. For instance, the <a href=\"/apec-water-roes-50-review\">Apec Water ROES-50</a> can remove up to 40 and the <a href=\"/multipure-aquaro-review\">Multipure AquaRO</a> can remove more than 80.","This system uses three separate stages to filter your water. It uses a pre-filter, reverse osmosis membrane and a carbon post filter. Each stage helps remove different contaminants from the water. One standout feature of this system is its filters will last approximately 12 months before they need to be replaced, which is twice as long as the filters last on  many similar water filters. However, the AquaKinetic doesn’t offer any type of notification system that will tell you when the filter is ready to be replaced. You must be diligent with this system’s maintenance on your own.","The filters on this unit can easily be replaced. However, the installation of the entire system requires the aid of a professional plumber, which is a drawback as it can be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, this water filtration system takes up an ample amount of space under your sink. It is 15 inches wide, 5 inches deep and 21 inches long. A standard faucet is included with this device, but there are not design options available.","The Kinetico AquaKinetic is covered under a seven-year warranty. This is an impressive warranty as many similar products are only covered under a one-year warranty. Additionally, email and telephone options are available to reach Kinetico representatives. Our interactions with representatives from this company were excellent, and they were willing to assist us and answer all of our questions quickly and in detail."]},"id":"d0bfae70-851a-464c-899a-5970a413c367","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a7123a64-d7d3-46c2-bc96-6ed1872221ab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kinetico AquaKinetic offers several standout features, including a long lifespan on filters and a seven-year warranty.
