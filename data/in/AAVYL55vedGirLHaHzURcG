You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Broil King Monarch 931264 LP is a simple machine with one purpose: to make delicious grilled food. This <a href=\"/best-gas-grills\">gas grill</a> has an aluminum frame, so it is lightweight, and it features a cast iron cooking grate, which will help it retain heat. This Broil King grill is smaller than many of the other gas grills we reviewed, and it doesn&#39;t produce as much heat, but it is still one of the top ten best gas grills we found in our research.","The primary burners on the Monarch can generate up to 35,000 BTUs, which is the lowest BTU number in our review, but that is probably appropriate since the primary cooking area is also the smallest at 350 square inches. The warming racks is also on the small side at 170 square inches. A low BTU number means that the grill won&#39;t get as hot as other similar-sized grills; but, on the other hand, it will use less gas than the other grills. In addition to the primary burners, this grill has a 10,000-BTU stainless steel side burner.","This grill won’t accommodate large guest lists like some of the larger grills will. The more guests you have the longer they may have to wait for food. However, if you primarily just cook for the family and close friends, this grill may be the perfect size for your needs. Its light weight frame also makes it very mobile, so you can position it wherever it’s most convenient your yard and stash it away in a discreet location when you’re done.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"dd25154f-ff34-4f43-a214-37c5b0ee19b7","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The lid on the Broil King Monarch is made of aluminum with a stainless steel insert. The stainless steel insert is resistant to rust, and the aluminum helps make this gas grill very light. It only weighs 95 pounds, which is the lightest product in our gas grill reviews. It&#39;s also quite small, measuring 59 inches high (with the lid open), 54 inches wide and 22 inches deep.","Even though the frame of this gas grill may be a little flimsy, the cooking grate is made of porcelain-coated cast iron. Cast iron retains heat very well, so you&#39;ll be able to get those beautiful sear marks on your steak. Plus, the porcelain coating will help prevent corrosion, and it makes the cooking grates easy to clean.","If you need help with your Broil King Monarch, you can look at the FAQs page on the Broil King website, but the information there is somewhat sparse. It should cover most of the questions you have, but if you have additional questions, you can contact customer support. We were pleased with the friendly and informative interaction we had with the customer support team of Broil King."]},"id":"60295f1e-ecbb-4c67-b6e8-ff1c64353a07","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5a2c0197-8779-452c-9139-b590de8f3de6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you don&#39;t have a lot of space, or if you expect to move your grill around a lot, then the Broil King Monarch might be your best option.
