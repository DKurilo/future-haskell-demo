The TEC G Sport is an infrared BBQ grill that transforms its shape and size to conform to how you use it. Detached from its base, the G Sport is an excellent portable infrared grill â€“ perfect for camping, trips to the beach, or any outdoor venture that could benefit from a sizzling steak or delicious burger. With the base, the G Sport is a suitable mainstay in any backyard or patio where you serve cuts of meat to friends and family.","The G Sport infrared grill achieves restaurant-style grilling results in your own backyard due to the uniform temperature distribution across the cooking surface. The G Sport accomplishes this via its ceramic infrared element. The lack of an open flame not only eliminates hot and cold spots, but also renders the infrared grill virtually flareproof.","The G Sport&#39;s infrared element draws 22,000 BTUs to power the main burners. The primary cooking area of 309 square inches falls right in between a standup and a portable grill, so it&#39;s not too big, not too small.","This middle ground is both a boon and a drawback for the G Sport. It is ideal for transporting the grill from place to place with enough grilling room and power to cook a reasonable amount of food. However, the portable nature of the grill led to the omission of almost every extra feature we rated in our infrared grill comparison chart.","Detached from its base, the G Sport is the only infrared grill we reviewed that&#39;s safe for use on combustible surfaces such as wood or plastic. This feature adds to its portability portfolio. The fact that you can barbecue on a picnic table at a campground without fear of burning the forest down is a huge plus when you want to grill the rainbow trout you caught on your fishing trip while it&#39;s still fresh.","Some grillers shy away from infrared grills, believing they only cook at very high temperatures. This isn&#39;t true. With the G Sport, the cooking intensity ranges from a slow-roasting 200 degrees to a searing 800 degrees. This versatility is not unique to the G Sport, but it is good to know that it has heat settings besides hot and searing hot."]},"id":"ed5bcb79-37d1-4e36-afe3-eadda0527208","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5cadf0ce-4e22-472d-aab9-33d03be331f8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Control, durability and portability are the main selling points of TEC&#39;s G Sport.

If it included any one of those features, the G Sport would be a force to be reckoned with.
