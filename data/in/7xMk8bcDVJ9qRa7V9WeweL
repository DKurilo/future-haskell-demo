You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","LED light bulbs are an excellent way to improve your quality of light while reducing your power bill and carbon footprint. The best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/light-bulb-guide,review-1986.html\">LED light bulbs</a> run on significantly less power than a traditional incandescent light bulb and the TCP LED 40W uses a mere 7 watts to provide light comparable to 40-watt incandescent bulbs.","By switching your incandescent and CFL bulbs out for LED lights, you can save money on your power bill. The TCP LED 40W bulb only uses 7 watts of power and costs about 84 cents a year to run, based on the manufacturer standard of three hours of use, seven days a week. This works out to be approximately 85 percent less energy than a traditional incandescent light.","The TCP LED 40W light bulb is a directional bulb, meaning that the light produced from the bulb does not shine equally from every direction. This can be a problem if you use this LED bulb in a light fixture that faces upward, such as a table lamp as it will not fill the whole room with light. The TCP LED 40W bulb is best used in downward-facing fixtures, such as ceiling lamps or fan fixtures or where you want to have accent lights, rather than fill lights. Unfortunately, the TCP LED 40W is not compatible with dimmer switches.","Fortunately, you can use this LED light outdoors as well as in your home. This makes it a good choice for downward-facing porch lights, and because it hardly uses any power, you won&#39;t be anxious if you forget to turn it off in the morning."]},"id":"6ac20964-ee88-400b-9bf4-21c0c6fe89ca","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c47139fa-07a1-46de-8eec-d4d7bcada09d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are looking for an LED bulb that provides directional soft white light and hardly consumes any energy at all, then the TCP LED 40W light bulb is an excellent choice.
