While it does keep track of where each asset is, it also optimizes design and reminds businesses when certain assets need to be maintained. Further, it provides techniques that are helpful in commissioning assets and replacing them. Many also help keep track of warranties on assets. Some popular types of this software include <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/sap/\">SAP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/ifs/\">IFS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/mintek/\">Mintek Transcendent</a>.","Aside from helping companies manage assets throughout their life cycle, another benefit to this software is its ability to track and manage all items wherever they are located, even in different facilities, departments or geographical locations. All of these benefits reduce labor, production and maintenance costs, while limiting downtime and increasing productivity.","<strong>Enterprise Asset Management: What to Look For</strong>","Choosing EAM software can help businesses in many ways. However, there are several important factors to think about before making a decision on which software is the right choice. Companies need to consider what industries and processes the software is useful for, whether any special editions are available for customized use and if the system can be used with any other technologies.","<strong>Industries &amp; Processes</strong><br/>Most asset management services support asset operations, such as tracking check-ins and checkouts of assets, scheduling maintenance and managing contracts pertaining to assets. Some systems are better geared to certain industries and processes than others. When a company is looking for this type of software, it should consider carefully what industries the software manufacturer says the solution would work best for. Some solutions might work for any asset-intensive industry, while others might only be appropriate for the food industry or oil industry. By choosing a product made specifically for the industry they are in, businesses can get more from the software. Industries can include manufacturing, health care, the public sector and hospitality.","<strong>Special Editions</strong><br/>Special editions of the asset management software let companies focus on the specific needs of their industry. Each industry is different; the management needs of the public sector may focus on preventative maintenance to equipment, while the needs of the manufacturing industry may be reducing energy waste and unplanned downtime. Special editions of this software give companies the flexibility necessary to meet industry-specific requirements and improve management of their assets.","<strong>Use With Other Technologies</strong><br/>Some systems let companies use other types of technology along with the software. Cloud computing solutions, Microsoft Dynamics and enterprise resource planning systems are just a few of the technologies that may be integrated with a facilities management system. Businesses may also be given the option of uploading documents such as warranties and contracts and attaching them to the asset.","<strong>Mobile Capability</strong><br/>Mobile capability is an important feature included with many EAM solutions. This feature lets companies add assets and asset parts to the software when a worker is away from a computer. It is also beneficial to employees and subcontractors in the field who need access to safety instructions, part numbers and work orders when conducting maintenance on an asset.","Finding the right management software for physical assets can help companies track and manage important pieces of equipment throughout their life cycle. Doing so can reduce maintenance costs, eliminate downtime and improve productivity."]},"id":"ae595363-5e36-43fb-8de8-f81da5f0b6b9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"0774cefd-5262-4524-b5a5-71e3cd05a59a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.assetpoint.com/\">AssetPoint</a>","<a href=\"http://www.assetworks.com/products/eam\">AssetWorks</a>","<a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/category/enterprise-asset-management-eam\">IBM</a>","<a href=\"http://www.ifsworld.com/en/solutions/enterprise-asset-management/\">IFS</a>","<a href=\"http://www.infor.com/solutions/eam/\">Infor</a>","<a href=\"http://www.mintek.com/eam-cmms/asset-management/\">Mintek</a>","<a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/060286.html\">Oracle</a>","<a href=\"http://go.sap.com/solution/lob/asset-management.html\">SAP</a>","<a href=\"http://software.schneider-electric.com/products/avantis/enterprise-asset-management/\">Schneider Electric</a>","<a href=\"https://www.to-increase.com/erp/construction/microsoft-dynamics-ax/enterprise-asset-management/\">To-Increase</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"779c6121-4e01-4364-a0a4-a2d87fa1cc7d","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1819","url":"/best-enterprise-asset-management-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-06-29T21:39:57Z","datePublished":"2015-10-08T13:36:18Z","name":"Enterprise Asset Management Software Review","synopsis":"Enterprise asset management can help a company by ensuring its physical assets are protected, managed and cared for throughout their life cycle.
