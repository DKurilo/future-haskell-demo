Its website has many tools and resources to help you learn what you can expect from selling your <a href=\"/best-structured-settlement-annuity-companies\">structured settlement</a>.","When you receive a structured settlement after an accident or as a result of winning a lawsuit, you may find yourself better served by receiving the settlement as a single lump sum amount rather than monthly payments. However, you should know that a discount rate will be applied, and you won&#39;t receive the entire sum of your settlement. Like <a href=\"/strategic-capital-review\">Strategic Capital</a> and <a href=\"/j.g.-wentworth-review\">J.G. Wentworth</a>, Fairfield Funding does not post rates or fees on its site.","To see what your actual payment would be, you can fill out a form on Fairfield&#39;s website with your settlement details and contact information. They&#39;ll provide you with a quote, and you can elect whether you want to sell all of your settlement, a portion of it, or if it&#39;s best to continue receiving monthly payments.","Fairfield Funding offers a customer satisfaction guarantee that promises to beat any offer. If you do receive a better offer from another structured settlement company, Fairfield promises to pay you $500. This guarantee also promises to provide interest-free cash advances and to quickly process your transaction.","Selling your structured settlement is a complicated process, and Fairfield Funding&#39;s website does a good job of providing information and tools to help you learn more about it. Most importantly, you will need a judge to sign off on the transaction. Some states require that you consult an attorney or independent financial consultant as part of the process.","Fairfield Funding claims to be transparent about its fees. According to the company, it doesn&#39;t charge additional fees, and it pays notary and court-filing fees.","The selling process can span 45 to 90 days, but Fairfield Funding does allow you to receive a cash advance. If you chose this option, you can receive some portion of your payout in as little as five days.","Selling your structured annuity is a good way to get funds to pay for a new house, pay off debt or medical expenses. Fairfield Funding has over seven years&#39; experience buying structured annuities. Its website can help you learn more about its sales process and structured annuities in general. To see how much you&#39;re eligible to receive, you&#39;ll need to contact the company for a free quote."]},"id":"96a46483-d177-41d0-8c5b-0dee1b6cf5ec","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68620","url":"/fairfield-funding-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-26T20:23:55Z","datePublished":"2016-10-26T20:23:55Z","name":"Fairfield Funding","synopsis":"Fairfield Funding focuses strictly on buying structured settlements and has been in business for seven years now.
