It performs its basic function of converting a Blu-ray disc to the more common DVD format superbly. Additionally, regardless of how tech-savvy you may or may not be, you will have no trouble navigating this application. We found the interface to be reminiscent of gaming applications, with a modern and lustrous interface and a sleek color scheme.","The software can compress a Blu-ray movie into one or more DVDs; typically one DVD-5 or DVD-9 or two DVD-5s, depending on how much compression is needed. You can adjust the video output parameters and use the splitter function to trim and merge various sections of the Blu-ray disc. In addition, the software also has a built-in burning engine that allows you to specify the number of copies you want made once conversion is complete.","Like a few others we reviewed, this Blu-ray to DVD converter software unfortunately does not have built-in Blu-ray decryption. This means you must purchase a third-party driver before you can convert Blu-ray discs with this software. This is a strange omission because the DVD copy software offered by OpenCloner has these copy protection removal features built in.","There&#39;s no question the best part of this software is its output quality. Every test run we did produced very high-quality output files comparable to those of our top three products. We were unable to detect any quality loss and the audio and video were accurately synched. However, it is important to note that the more compression there is (e.g. converting a Blu-ray to just one DVD-5), the more likely there will be a noticeable loss in quality.","Another area the software impresses is its technical support. The application offers more comprehensive support than any other software we reviewed. If you need to contact the manufacturer directly, you can do so through live chat or using one of the many email addresses listed on their website. In addition, the website has an exclusive &#34;support center&#34; where you can submit an online ticket to address specific issues regarding this application. If you happen to lose your registration code (required to download the application from the internet), you can recover it using the site&#39;s simple registration code recovery."]},"id":"b0b4d5fe-f5d9-43b7-aa06-379eb9468a46","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a7854ab8-cb25-4c4f-b3dd-a03988a2b346","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Blu-ray to DVD converter software doesn&#39;t get much more basic than this application; it lacks personalization features and does not come equipped with any decryption capabilities.
