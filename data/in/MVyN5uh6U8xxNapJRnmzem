We were impressed as we reviewed and researched the plethora of <a href=\"/electronics/family/best-battery-chargers/\">battery chargers</a> that are available on today s market. Within the top ten products alone you will find battery chargers with an LCD screen to tell you how charged each of your batteries is, battery chargers that comes in a protective case for organization and travel purposes and battery chargers that can be used across the world because of an international voltage range.","In addition to the features available in battery chargers, there are solid benefits that come from using rechargeable batteries as well.","<strong>1. Convenient</strong><br/>Rechargeable batteries can easily and conveniently be recharged with a simple battery charger. Battery chargers come in a variety of designs which  are continually evolving and becoming more convenient, reliable, easy to use and durable. Some battery chargers will charge a number of different types of batteries   a convenient feature given the many different types of batteries we all use. Also, battery chargers can now charge in a number of ways: through a wall outlet, a computer USB port and even a car port. So no matter what your resources are, you have more battery charger options than ever before to keep fully charged batteries close at hand.","<strong>2. Better Performance</strong><br/>Rechargeable batteries use 1.2 volts of energy the entire time they are in use. Disposable batteries start at 1.5 volts and progressively get lower until it they are dead. By using rechargeable batteries, you get peak performance at all times, even when the &#34;low battery&#34; signal comes on. Some battery chargers provide a  refresh  mode which will drain your rechargeable batteries before fully charging them again. This mode and function ensures that you always get the optimum performance and life from your batteries.","<strong>3- Earth Friendly</strong><br/>Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries are better for the environment than nickel cadmium (NiCd) rechargeable batteries, but both are better than disposable batteries. Rechargeable batteries produce less waste because they can be recharged with a simple battery charger and reused hundreds of times. They also use less energy because recharging batteries with a battery charger is more energy efficient than the cost and energy of making new batteries.","<strong>4- Save Time</strong><br/>Instead of running to the store or making a trip to the battery section each time you run out of batteries, think how much time you would save by having rechargeable batteries and a battery charger in your own home, ready to use at any time. Simply put the fully charged batteries in the device and stick the dead ones on the battery charger. Even if you don t have extra recharged batteries, in as little as 15 minutes you could have your batteries fully charged again, which beats the time it would take to get to the store, get the batteries, purchase them and get home to use them.","<strong>5-\tSave Money</strong><br/>Although the initial cost of a battery charger plus the rechargeable batteries may make you feel like making the transformation isn t worth it, think about it in the long term sense. Rechargeable batteries are capable of being used more than 500 times. Imagine buying one pack of batteries instead of 500. Does it seem worth it now?"," ","Although rechargeable batteries and the initial battery charger can be somewhat costly, there are some fairly inexpensive options that will work just fine. For as low as $10 you can get a battery charger with a built-in timer which protects your rechargeable batteries and extends their life. Additional things to look at when you purchase a battery charger for your rechargeable batteries are shown in our side-by-side comparison of battery chargers. No matter which batteries and battery charger you choose, you can rest assured that it is money well spent. Aside from the convenience and environmentally friendly aspects of using rechargeable batteries, over the course of their lifetime, the rechargeable batteries could potentially save you hundreds of dollars each year.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "]},"id":"9285f222-9a71-4b5f-a0ea-1786e728f2e4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5470","url":"/battery-chargers-and-the-benefits-of-rechargeable-batteries","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-jarrett","url":"/author/jennifer-jarrett","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Jarrett","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"to2nPyy7e6PruwriKDDxWG","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-02-09T21:25:33Z","datePublished":"2011-02-09T21:25:33Z","name":"Battery Chargers and the Benefits of Rechargeable Batteries","synopsis":"There are a great deal of benefits that accompany rechargeable batteries and their battery charger.","review":{},"strapline":"There are a great deal of benefits that accompany rechargeable batteries and their battery charger.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-02-22T17:13:45Z","id":"MVyN5uh6U8xxNapJRnmzem","meta":{"title":"Battery Chargers and the Benefits of Rechargeable Batteries","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
