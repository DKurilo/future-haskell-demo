QuickVu <a href=\"/best-backup-camera\">backup camera</a> is extremely easy to set up and start using. Unlike other wireless cameras that still wire into your car’s rear lights for power, QuickVu is battery-powered, making it the easiest backup camera to install. Simply attach the camera to your vehicle at the top of your license plate and plug the monitor into your cigarette lighter outlet to get going.","<strong>Performance</strong>","QuickVu’s performance during our hands-on testing of signal quality, video clarity, night vision and ease of use wasn’t the best we tested. However, it’s still an effective tool for checking your rear blind spot.  It uses a digital wireless signal resistant to interference. There is a noticeable bit of lag in the display, but not enough to be much of a hindrance unless you back up too quickly. The wireless system is easy to install, but its setup makes it a little less convenient to use long-term than other models that wire into your car for power – such as the <a href=\"/yada-digital-wireless-backup-camera-review\">Yada</a> backup camera. Because the QuickVu runs on AA batteries, you have to take the camera off your car when they need replacing. Since the camera and monitor activate whenever you turn on your car for a set time, battery duration depends on your use and settings, though they should last about a year if you use it for four 30-second increments every day. We ran into a small issue trying to replace the batteries during our tests because the screws holding the back on the device were somewhat stripped upon arrival, which we found odd but easy to fix. Each screw also has a small gasket, which we assume is to keep the camera waterproof. In the process of changing the batteries, two of these gaskets fell off their screws, so be careful not to lose them.","<strong>Camera</strong>","The QuickVu camera, wireless transmitter and battery are all housed in a bar that mounts above your license plate. It’s weatherproof and equipped with LEDs to illuminate the area behind your vehicle when it’s dark. Since the casing is all one piece, you cannot adjust the angle of the camera. The camera turns on whenever the monitor receives power, such as when you turn your ignition. It can stay on for a determined amount of time, which you can set in the monitor’s menu. You can also turn it on and off using the monitor’s power buttons.","<strong>Monitor</strong>","The QuickVu backup camera comes with a 4.3-inch LCD monitor. It plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter outlet. The included cord is wound into a springy spiral, which is nice as long as you don’t want to mount it too far away from the outlet, as the tension could pull your monitor and make it fall. Its slender pedestal mount attaches to your dashboard using adhesive. You can also purchase a suction-cup mount, which we preferred. The monitor has three buttons on the back for menu access and to turn the distance scale lines on and off.","The QuickVu is a great backup camera if you don’t want to splice into your car’s wiring system. While it isn’t the best-quality feed we tested, it is still a great DIY choice, since anyone can install it."]},"id":"e6c99cdb-eb8e-431b-9d0d-9ecdf48ebf20","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60120","url":"/quickvu-backup-camera-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-04T17:12:39Z","datePublished":"2014-08-04T17:12:39Z","name":"QuickVu Digital Wireless","synopsis":"The QuickVu backup camera is extremely easy to set up and start using.","review":{"rating":85,"verdict":"Anyone can set up the QuickVu camera, making it a great quick fix, but it requires more upkeep than others.","pros":["It&#8217;s easy to install and start using immediately."],"cons":["You have to change the camera&#8217;s batteries periodically."]},"strapline":"The QuickVu backup camera is extremely easy to set up and start using.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","id":"bhFqe3fTDpDVMmzpSxwVhC","meta":{"title":"QuickVu Backup Camera Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Anyone can set up the QuickVu camera, making it a great quick fix, but it requires more upkeep than others."},"products":[{"slug":"quickvu-digital-wireless","url":"/product/quickvu-digital-wireless","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:52:20Z","name":"QuickVu Digital Wireless","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:52:20Z","id":"ffxHwpUVYuSMrZwbzG23GA","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T18:52:20Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/nke83saVBVqDn9YTTXMgXG.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:52:20Z","mimeType":"","name":"b9d922bbc7d87d048265c3c46fa2fb4b.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/b9d922bbc7d87d048265c3c46fa2fb4b.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:52:20Z","id":"nke83saVBVqDn9YTTXMgXG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nke83saVBVqDn9YTTXMgXG.jpg","alt":""},"title":"QuickVu Backup Camera Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Anyone can set up the QuickVu camera, making it a great quick fix, but it requires more upkeep than others."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/nke83saVBVqDn9YTTXMgXG.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:52:20Z","mimeType":"","name":"b9d922bbc7d87d048265c3c46fa2fb4b.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/b9d922bbc7d87d048265c3c46fa2fb4b.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:52:20Z","id":"nke83saVBVqDn9YTTXMgXG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nke83saVBVqDn9YTTXMgXG.jpg","alt":""},"title":"QuickVu Backup Camera Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Anyone can set up the QuickVu camera, making it a great quick fix, but it requires more upkeep than others."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/auto/best-backup-camera/quickvu-backup-camera-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"travel-and-auto","url":"/travel-and-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:52:20Z","name":"Travel & Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:52:20Z","id":"HmhJjMTFinoVnKmEwqRGEm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"car-tech","url":"/travel-and-auto/car-tech","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:52:20Z","name":"Car Tech","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:52:20Z","id":"JteG32DMJqAaptK5hKu7Wk","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
