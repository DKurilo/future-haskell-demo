This time around, we spent over 35 hours performing online research – comparing features on manufacturer pages to those of other third-party retailers, scouring various online informational resources, reading customer reviews and watching informational tutorials.","We reached out to manufacturers to learn about how they approach these cleaners, from their engineering choices to how they support the product once consumers purchase it. We also contacted pool industry experts and everyday users to learn what they think of the devices, what their favorite brands are and what their experience is with pressure-side cleaners is overall. Long-time pool owner Cheri Vinson said she prefers the Kreepy Krauly Racer, which has done a thorough job cleaning her backyard pool for years.","All things said, our research and discussions have helped us gain further insight into why pressure-side pool cleaners are popular, along with which brands are the highest quality and most trustworthy. We considered what we learned from our discussions with manufacturers and users, as well as each cleaner’s features to bring you well-rounded reviews of pool cleaners that’re both high quality and an excellent value.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","We recently spent over 35 hours researching and studying 10 pressure pool cleaners – something we’ve done for other three years – to learn everything we can about them and present to you our findings. We compared features on product pages, read customer reviews, and watched informational and review videos. In addition to talking to pool cleaner manufacturers, we also contacted pool supply stores and serious pool owners to talk to them about their experience with pool cleaners over the years. We wanted to get first-hand statements about these cleaners from the people who understand them best, and we gleaned why they choose pressure-side cleaners over robotic or suction options. We even got expert opinions about which pool cleaners work best for distinct types of pools and why.","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying Pressure Pool Cleaners</strong>","Suction Power<br/>If your pool is exposed to a lot of debris, such as leaves from surrounding trees and dense landscaping, a pressure cleaner is more effective than smaller pressure side-suction cleaners, which are lighter and lack the power of a pressure cleaner. Consider the size of your pool, and what types of debris it’s prone to – whether it’s nearby trees, animals or something else – and find a pool cleaner that can handle the corresponding size and quantity of debris.","Pressure cleaners can handle larger pieces of dirt and debris that fall into the pool. However, they require more suction and must be used with a booster pump. Some have debris bags with multiple chambers, or ones specifically made for fine particles like silt, not for sticks or larger debris.","Booster Pump<br/>Each pool cleaner model specifies whether it has an internal booster pump or requires an external one. Even if the vacuum has an onboard booster, you still need to have a booster line to connect it to. If it requires an external booster, you need to contact your pool professional to have one installed to operate the machine, which adds to the overall cost of the device. However, booster pumps do make your pressure pool cleaner more effective overall. They can make for a faster cleaning session, more consistent power and can even reduce wear and tear on the cleaner.","Pool Compatibility<br/>If you have an above-ground pool, most pressure pool cleaners won’t work for you. Look for a pressure side-suction cleaner instead. Most pool vacuums are designed for 8-foot deep ends and a surface area of 10 x 10 feet. If your pool is larger than that, get a hose extension so the vacuum can reach all corners of the pool. If you have a vinyl liner, the manufacturer should specify if the vacuum is suited for that type of surface. Some rotary brushes can damage vinyl or tile.","Mobility<br/>It’s important that your pool cleaner can run autonomously so you’re not stuck monitoring it for several hours. You should ensure that the cleaner you choose has a long enough hose for your pool, or at least that it allows you to customize the length of it as needed. The best pressure pool cleaners should easily be able to handle the various terrains and locales within your pool, be it stairs, walls or any other curves or corners. A few cleaners have treaded tires and/or front-wheel drive, which in turn makes it easier for it to maneuver autonomously. Some units struggle or are completely unable to properly access and clean those areas, so be sure to choose a device that best suits your pool’s unique design. ","The quantity of jets a pressure pool cleaner has also greatly affects speed and mobility. Though thrust jets serve a dual-purpose for loosening stubborn dirt and sucking in debris, they can also affect the speed at which the cleaner moves and the direction it moves in. These jets are where water that the cleaner has already processed exits. Good pressure cleaners also have an in-line back-up valve, which can help remove it if it gets stuck.","<strong>Benefits of Using a Pressure Pool Cleaner</strong>","By investing in a pressure pool cleaner, you essentially allow yourself to spend more time playing and relaxing in your pool than manually cleaning it. Some cleaners even allow you to set up an automated cleaning schedule that can run one or more times per week, ensuring that your pool is always clean and ready for use. Additionally, out of the three types of pool cleaners – pressure, suction and robotic – it’s average for cleaning power, energy usage and most importantly, price. These cleaners can generally handle most pool and debris sizes.","In addition to cleaning your pool, pressure cleaners also help distribute filtered, clean water. Ones that come with their own debris bag collect dirt, leaves, acorns and other detritus, then carry it around while it cleans instead of leaving it for your pool’s filter to handle. This can likely save you money in the long run when it comes to pump and filter maintenance.","Pressure pool cleaners are fairly easy to repair. Many common issues can be resolved by you with minimal troubleshooting. Most manufacturers have installation manuals, user manuals, FAQs and other informational resources on their website.","<strong>Downsides of Using a Pressure Pool Cleaner</strong>","Though it isn’t the case for all pressure cleaners, most require a connection to a separate booster pump in order to run. Your pool’s booster pump is what gives some of these pool cleaners access to constant high pressure, which is what can make a real difference in removing stubborn dirt from your pool. Alternatively, you can use your pool’s existing pressure line, although that may not offer quite as much pressure.","Another downside to pressure side pool cleaners is additional costs. Though, upfront, pressure cleaners may not cost as much as their counterparts, they can incur other costs, especially if you don’t already have an existing booster pump. You may also need to pay for installation, additional hose or added pressure.","<strong>How Much Do Pool Cleaners Cost?</strong>","The pressure pool cleaners we evaluated cost an average $508. If your pool is particularly large you may need to purchase an additional hose, so the cleaner can reach every inch. Hose costs vary depending on how much hose you’re buying. Additional parts for your pool can also drive up costs, such as wall fittings which run about $10 or less and replacement bags and filters around $20.","<strong>Other Types of Pool Cleaners</strong>","Manual. If you don’t mind doing the work yourself, a manual pool cleaner is a good, budget-friendly option. Best-suited for small in-ground or above-ground pools, these cleaners are fairly small. They resemble vacuums, as they are comprised of a vacuum head, hose and telescopic pole. You can add on a scrub brush or skim vac if your pool requires it.","Manual cleaning is somewhat time-consuming, but it gives you more precise control over the cleaning process – you can get rid of every last bit of debris, without gambling on whether your automated pool cleaner will catch it. You can also use a manual cleaner between automated pool cleaning sessions, in case your pool has a couple leaves in it.","Robotic. Robotic cleaners are fully automated and self-contained. They move around your pool on their own, scrubbing the floor and walls as they go. This type of pool cleaner doesn’t need to be attached to your pool’s circulation system or any other port and uses an internal drive motor to move around. Robotic pool cleaners typically have an attached bag where they catch and store leaves, dirt and other small debris. Though they are beloved for how easy they are to setup and use – they are more or less ready to use right out of the box – they are notoriously fragile and require expensive repairs.","Suction Side Automatic. This type of pool cleaner is your best bet if your pool is susceptible to collecting small to fine particles like dirt or sand. However, it isn’t designed to handle larger sticks, leaves and other debris and clogs if it encounters them. A suction side automatic cleaner connects to a dedicated suction line within your pool rather than the main drain suction port, and it moves around slowly by way of pulsing the surrounding water.
