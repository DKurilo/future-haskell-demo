The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-providers\">Cell Phone Providers</a> here.</em>","You&#39;d be forgiven for not having heard of Consumer Cellular. An AARP partner, the company doesn&#39;t advertise itself far beyond its target demographic, which is made up of AARP members and families of older, retired individuals. Its prices are competitive, and thanks to AT&amp;T&#39;s network, its coverage and data speeds are both quite solid. Yet Consumer Cellular doesn&#39;t offer the same experience you get at the best cell phone providers, which is why – at least for most people – we recommend carriers higher on our lineup.","Next to the cheap, unlimited talk and text options offered by all the best cell phone plans across its competition, Consumer Cellular&#39;s limited-talk, limited-text options are affordable but disappointing. The company breaks those plans into two halves – voice minutes and text/data allocations – which you pay for separately. Minutes are available in six different tiers, ranging from zero minutes for just $10 a month (useful if you almost never call, with overages billed per minute) to unlimited minutes for $50.","Text and data bundles are likewise tiered but in connected allocations. Thus, you can buy 300 texts and 30MB of data per month for $2.50 or unlimited texts and 3GB of data for $30. You can&#39;t, however, buy very few text messages and a lot of data. When you compare Consumer Cellular&#39;s cell phone plans with what&#39;s on offer at other cell phone companies, it performs decently enough: You can expect 3GB of data and 750 talk minutes for about $50 or 1,500 minutes for $60 total. Heavy chatters will miss the ubiquity of cheap, unlimited talk and text plans.","Given that it operates on <a href=\"/att-wireless-review\">AT&amp;T&#39;s</a> nationwide network, Consumer Cellular sports some of the best cell phone service you can get. It&#39;s not quite as widespread as <a href=\"/verizon-review\">Verizon</a> offers, nor as fast as what <a href=\"/t-mobile-review\">T-Mobile</a> can provide, but AT&amp;T&#39;s network finds a nice balance between speed and coverage, and Consumer Cellular reaps the benefits. The downside is in data allocations: Due to the nature of its deal with AT&amp;T, its customers can’t use more than 4GB of data at high speeds, and 6GB of data total, per month. That’s not a big problem if you’re only buying service for yourself, but if you want to add lines to your plan for $10 each and share the minutes and data, you’ll have to watch your usage.","The company also falls flat in device selection. The only flagship devices available are Apple iPhones; every Android phone on offer is either dated or midtier. Given that Consumer Cellular&#39;s superb EasyPay monthly payment system makes buying expensive flagship phones easy, the lack of Android diversity is almost maddening."]},"id":"bd588742-3143-451b-a6c7-9843563243ed","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d34f3a50-a33a-448c-94e4-c2279d855250","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Consumer Cellular is a perfectly capable cell phone provider, offering great customer service and decent rates to its customers.
