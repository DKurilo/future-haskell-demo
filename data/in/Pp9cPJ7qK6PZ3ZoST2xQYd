Clicking the buy button will take you to the current version of the product for purchase. The updated model includes a new optional Nvidia graphics card and a built in Intel RealSense camera.<br/></em>","There’s nothing wrong with a PC that does what it sets out to do. Dell’s Inspiron 24 (7000 series) sets out to be a straightforward <a href=\"/electronics/computers\">all-in-one computer</a> that serves most of your family members’ needs, and it does that. But it doesn’t stand out in any way, lacking the selling points that might drive someone to pick the Inspiron over one of its competitors.","Nothing is more important to how an all-in-one feels than its monitor. The Inspiron’s 24-inch display is merely average, offering the same 1080p resolution that most of the competition puts forward. It has a generic pair of stereo speakers built in to the frame and lacks an optical drive of any sort, yet it is chunkier and heavier than any of its closest competitors, weighing in at over 20 pounds.","Inside the chassis rests an Intel i5-6300HQ processor. This chip is the Inspiron’s sole bright point, as it’s relatively fast, having earned a PassMark score of 5,757 – well above the 5,000-point baseline we expect from modern computers and higher than any of the other all-in-one desktops we reviewed in its price range.","As nice as the CPU is, Dell didn’t pair it with a discrete graphics card, relying instead on Intel’s integrated graphics capabilities to power the 1080p monitor. Integrated graphics are common in laptops and even some all-in-ones, but the best computers always install dedicated graphics cards from NVIDIA or AMD. Without one, the Inspiron 24 can’t handle even basic gaming, much less image editing or high-quality streaming. It’s not a deal breaker for many families, but it’s a disappointment.","On the connectivity front, the Inspiron holds its own. Four USB 3.0 ports let you connect any modern peripheral to the computer, and another two USB 2.0 ports are available for devices that use the older standard. Most USB 2.0 devices work in USB 3.0 ports but a handful don’t, so their inclusion can come in handy. There are also two HDMI ports on the system, one input and one output. HDMI inputs are useful if you want to plug in an external device like a PlayStation or Blu-ray player and use the Inspiron as a TV, while outputs are great for connecting an extra monitor and using multiple screens at once."]},"id":"4255e5a7-d392-46f3-9043-0bbd86e71573","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c6b2c108-5907-4b79-9012-b48932ec907a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Here at Top Ten Reviews, we’re all about comparisons, and when you compare the Dell Inspiron 24 against its competition, it’s easy to see why it lags behind.
