It has a couple of user-friendly features, including preset temperatures and roller speeds. It is a small laminating machine, however, and is only appropriate for certain uses.","This small, portable laminator was designed for a specific purpose: laminating photos and documents. While the 4.4-inch width may be large enough for other small projects, like laminating badges and IDs, it is not large enough for bigger projects, like posters and banners. If you&#39;d prefer a larger laminator, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/scotch-review\">Scotch</a>. Because the Business Source allows for lamination thicknesses between 3 and 5 millimeters, it does offer variety to the documents and photos you might want to laminate. 3-millimeter lamination films and pouches are typically less expensive to purchase, making them ideal for documents and photos that need to be used temporarily. Films and pouches 5 millimeters thick can be used on projects that require more permanent lamination.","The laminating machine uses both hot and cold technology with the help of two rollers. When using the thermal option, the rollers deliver heat and seal the document while preventing bubbles and wrinkles. When using cold technology, the rollers apply the right amount of pressure to seal the self-sealing pouches around the photo or document being laminated. With this device, heat films must be used with the thermal option, while self-sealing pouches are required for the cold pressure option.","This machine is designed in such a way that anyone can use it, even a novice, thanks to its preset settings. You don&#39;t have to worry about selecting the right temperature or roller speed when laminating because the machine does this for you. Two features this portable laminator doesn&#39;t have are easy-load technology and a reverse function. If the film, document or pouch is misfed or becomes jammed, you may have to call a technician to retrieve the document so that you can operate the machine again.","While the Business Source Document &amp; Photo Laminator may have convenient settings that keep you from having to understand and input the correct temperature for a film or roller speed, its small size prevents it from being useful for projects other than document and photo laminating. This document laminating machine does offer both hot and cold lamination, though, and can work with both hot films and cold pouches."]},"id":"cc25af6e-ac93-4570-b206-05d26ef3ebb4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63390","url":"/business-source-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-10T20:59:29Z","datePublished":"2015-03-10T20:59:29Z","name":"Business Source Document & Photo","synopsis":"The Business Source Document & Photo Laminator has a 4.4-inch entry that can be used with both hot film and cold pouches.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Business Source Document & Photo Laminator has a 4.4-inch entry that can be used with both hot film and cold pouches.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-10T20:59:29Z","id":"DZaKRhgEApPMXCCEvJHEdV","meta":{"title":"Business Source Document & Photo Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Business Source Document &amp; Photo Laminator has a two-roller system with preset temperatures.
