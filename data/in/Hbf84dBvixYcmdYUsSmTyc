Folks often ask why we do not review Windows Defender. The answer is that it is not among the best antivirus products for PC, nor has Microsoft ever claimed otherwise. Microsoft has made clear that it includes Defender in Windows 8 as baseline protection to protect those who will never quite get around to buying something better.","Defender is easy to install. It displays a green icon if all is well, yellow if you are at risk and red when it discovers malware. The antivirus protection is in real time, in the same fashion as most of its commercial counterparts, which means that Defender doesn t wait for malware to attach; it alerts you while the malware is trying to gain entrance. You can set up automatic scans that will put any problem files into Quarantine awaiting your decision about their fate. Unfortunately, there is not much more functionality to Defender than that.","In our review of <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">best antivirus software</a>, we use the test results from independent lab AV Test to largely determine our rankings. Among the virus scanner brands that dominated at AV Test during the March/April 2014 tests were Bitdefender, Kaspersky, McAfee, Norton, Trend Micro, Avira and BullGuard. Windows Defender was at the bottom of the class of 25 competitors that AV Test evaluated continuously for two months. We should clarify that Defender s weaknesses are not in the areas of performance and usability. In fact, the performance tests demonstrated that Defender has less of a negative influence on system performance than the industry average while visiting websites, downloading software, copying data and running applications. And Defender proved itself to be highly usable in the sense that it does not tend to falsely warn about files and websites that are perfectly legitimate. In fact, during a system scan of 826,400 software samples, Defender made just one false detection where it confused an example of safe software with malware. No, the area that Defender lags behind commercial antivirus software (and even free versions of such software, for that matter) is protection against malware infections such as viruses, worms and Trojan horses. It is no wonder, then, that Defender slows system performance less than third-party antivirus scanners: It isn t doing the work that they are doing. Let s consider some test data.","The AV Test protection tests have two parts. One part measures the ability to detect malware that is brand new on the day it hits: zero-day malware that exploits some hitherto-unknown vulnerability in an operating system or application. Defender successfully detected 67.5 percent of 138 samples, which doesn t seem bad until you learn that the average success rate for the competitors in the test was 94 percent. The other part of the protection test subjected each participating antivirus software product to 20,647 samples of malware discovered during just the four weeks leading up to the tests. Against an industry average success rate of 98 percent, Defender scored 80.5 percent. Meanwhile, premier brands such as Bitdefender and Kaspersky turned in perfect protection scores.","Even if Defender achieved perfect scores, it would still not be a good substitute for third-party antivirus software because it lacks quite a few features. Most of the products in our best antivirus software review, for example, provide a bootable rescue CD that will have you up and running if your PC crashes from the sheer weight of infections. They also include protection from phishing, not just antivirus protection. Furthermore, when you run third-party antivirus software, you can reach a support technician for assistance   in some cases by online chat 24 hours a day, seven days a week.","Thanks to Microsoft, hundreds of millions of Windows users receive baseline antivirus protection by turning on Defender, which keeps hackers from fleecing the unprotected. Baseline protection is a wonderful thing. However, highly intelligent criminals have your personal identity in their crosshairs. Therefore, a far better way to go is with protection that exceeds the baseline. Windows Defender is not the best antivirus software. Bitdefender, the highest-ranked antivirus software we reviewed, kills and buries Defender in test results conducted by independent software labs."]},"id":"38eb5e08-3d40-4725-b4e0-b585e515cdff","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8907","url":"/windows-defender-is-not-the-best-antivirus","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"randall-sutherland","url":"/author/randall-sutherland","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Randall Sutherland","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"9vN6VRi7r7TmwKJt8Zd5aP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-10T17:02:24Z","datePublished":"2014-11-10T17:02:24Z","name":"Windows Defender Is Not the Best Antivirus","synopsis":"Windows Defender on Windows 8 is Windows-native antivirus protection similar to the Microsoft Security Essentials included with Windows Vista and Windows 7.","review":{},"strapline":"Windows Defender on Windows 8 is Windows-native antivirus protection similar to the Microsoft Security Essentials included with Windows Vista and Windows 7.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-11-10T17:05:55Z","id":"Hbf84dBvixYcmdYUsSmTyc","meta":{"title":"Windows Defender Is Not the Best Antivirus","description":"Windows Defender is better than nothing, but it is not the very best way to protect your PC from malware attacks.
