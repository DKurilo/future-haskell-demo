In some cases, they can help individuals stay in their homes when they are threatened with foreclosure. There are several types of mortgage and refinance loans, and individuals will have to choose the route that is best for their personal situation.","<strong>Fixed Interest Rate </strong>  This kind of refinancing option allows homeowners to receive a fixed interest rate.  This means that for the term of their loan, they will pay the same amount of interest   it will not increase or decrease.  This can bring peace of mind to homeowners, because they will know that in five or ten years  time, their interest rate will still be the same and they won t have to worry about it increasing dramatically and making payments difficult to handle.","<strong>Adjustable Rate </strong>  The adjustable rate is basically the opposite of the fixed rate refinancing option.  With this option, the individual chooses to have their interest rate change with the market.  Most of the people who choose this option do so because they want to enjoy extremely low interest rates when the market turns rather than being stuck in a fixed rate that is high compared with current market trends.  However, there is always the risk that the interest rates will dramatically increase rather than decrease, and the homeowner will have to pay those higher rates.","<strong>Interest Only Loan </strong>  With this refinancing option, homeowners will pay only the interest for a period of time as determined by the lender.  This will give the homeowner a financial break, and can help in certain situations, such as an impending foreclosure.  After the period is up, the regular payments will resume.","<strong>Balloon Refinancing Loan</strong>   This option allows homeowners to pay very small fixed interest rates for a period of time (usually no longer than ten years), and then at the end of that period, the full loan balance is due.","<strong>Home Equity Refinance Loan</strong>   With this kind of refinancing, you cash out the equity you have in your home, so that you can make major purchases, pay bills, etc.  You ll still receive the option of a fixed rate or a variable rate, but the cash will be a large help in certain situations.","Knowing what type of <a href=\"/best-mortgage-and-refinance-lenders\">mortgage and refinance</a> services are available will be highly beneficial to you if you&#39;re considering taking a look at restructuring your debt."]},"id":"a1da7187-5304-4c41-bd1e-524f262b8148","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_3926","url":"/learning-center","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"kristi-carter","url":"/author/kristi-carter","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Kristi Carter","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"ocdh7EzQoWJySdmVX2bDaL","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-02-01T11:17:49Z","datePublished":"2010-02-01T11:17:49Z","name":"Types of Mortgage Refinancing Loans","synopsis":"Mortgage refinancing loans are a wonderful way to gain benefits such as lower interest rates, smaller payments and more.","review":{},"strapline":"Mortgage refinancing loans are a wonderful way to gain benefits such as lower interest rates, smaller payments and more.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-10-13T18:46:47Z","id":"pcQY5kgwGefnFh7zMjiKoU","meta":{"title":"Types of Mortgage Refinancing Loans","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
