The AT&amp;T EL52100 is a combo device that comes with a high-quality speakerphone that achieves high volume levels without sacrificing clarity.","This telephone comes with a digital <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">answering machine</a> capable of recording up to 14 minutes of messages. When a new message is received, an icon appears on the handset and the base charger has an LED light that begins blinking with the number of messages on the inbox. When messages are recorded, a time and date stamp is attached to the front. You can further track caller details through the built-in caller ID memory, which tracks the last 50 callers so that you can quickly look up the number of the person who left a message without having to risk entering the number incorrectly.","The telephone answering machine comes with an audio jack for you to attach a headset and use the phone hands-free. In addition, the device is equipped with a loudspeaker and intercom function so you can work with multiple handsets. If you&#39;re in the middle of a call, the call waiting feature will alert you of additional calls on the handset and display the new caller&#39;s information so you can take the call or send it to the answering machine.","You can set up a greeting on this cordless phone with answering machine combo. In addition to a recorded message greeting for the answering machine, the device also offers trilingual prompts in case you commonly receive calls in multiple languages. And when a call comes in, the ringer can be set to a high volume for those who often struggle to hear when a call is coming. The loudspeakers on both the base set and handset have volume settings capable of reaching 30 decibels, and without sacrificing clarity. If you need a louder option, consider the <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">Amplicom AB900</a>.","The AT&amp;T EL52100 is an exceptional phone and answering machine combo, allowing you to easily manage phone calls and messages through the handset. It offers a quality answering machine with a significant amount of recording time, and leverages the phone&#39;s built-in caller ID memory so you can more quickly return calls. Combined with high audio levels through the speakerphone capabilities, this is a phone that you won&#39;t struggle to hear when the phone rings or when you&#39;re conversing on the handset."]},"id":"292646c5-11ff-421e-bad0-64a44526c2bc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61320","url":"/at-t-el52100-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-26T20:42:16Z","datePublished":"2014-11-26T20:42:16Z","name":"AT&T EL52100","synopsis":"Considering AT&T's prowess in the mobile phone sector, it's only natural the company would offer a phone with a built-in answering machine.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Considering AT&T's prowess in the mobile phone sector, it's only natural the company would offer a phone with a built-in answering machine.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-11-26T20:42:16Z","id":"AgL8953eoiEuWzot8ngHud","meta":{"title":"AT&T EL52100 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":" Considering AT&amp;T&#039;s prowess in the mobile phone sector, it&#039;s only natural the company would offer a phone with a built-in answering machine.
