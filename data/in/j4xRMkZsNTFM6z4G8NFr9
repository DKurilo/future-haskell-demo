Both the burning and the ripping are fast and ideal for copying and backup purposes. The main functions here are fairly basic compared to some of the more advanced authoring software we’ve included here in the <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD burning software</a> reviews, but we’re discovering that if you just want to back stuff up, these simpler, pared-down programs are ideal and painless.","Main functions include perfect 1:1 DVD-to-DVD copies, high quality compression from DVD-9 to DVD-5, DVD folder/ISO source file burn to DVD disc and a “copy main movie only” choice.","ImTOO DVD Copy Express is billed as being stable and fast and we definitely found that to be true. If you just need a simple program that will copy DVD-to-DVD or hard drive, ImTOO is perfect. The program uses a high speed burning process to replicate perfect 1:1 DVD copies.","ImTOO DVD Copy Express will completely copy a DVD-9 movie to 8.5GB dual-layer recordable disc (DVD+R DL, DVD-R DL) in 1:1 ratio. We noticed it also retains great compatibility: you can copy a DVD to any disc including dual-layer DVD (DVD-9) with any DVD+RW/-RW burner to play and it will play on any and all DVD players.","Before beginning the copy you can choose to keep audios/subtitles, choose one audio/subtitle, or copy without audio/subtitles. If you don’t need or use them, then why drag down the quality of your copy with data that doesn’t apply to you? Conversely we think having the option to choose is very cool and adds versatility to this program you don’t see in all software of this type.","ImTOO also gives you the option to remove menus when copying a DVD to ensure the best possible quality. You also have the option to include and skip menu for playing your target DVD disc directly.","Here’s something else we thought was a nice touch: If the rewritable disc you inserted happens to not be blank, the program will prompt you and walk you through the erasing process – if that’s what you want to do. A lot of these programs have this option but you have to root around to find it – ImTOO simply recognizes a disc as already having information on it and notifies you accordingly.","The interface can also be installed in the language of your choice: choose from English, German, Chinese and Japanese. You can further personalize the interface using a selection of skins.","ImTOO DVD Copy Express is one of the easiest and most painless programs we tried; just load your DVD into the drive, click &#34;Start Copy.&#34; The program prompts you whenever else it needs you to make a decision.","The download for this program is 2.12 MB, takes about 10-15 minutes to install and launch, and then you’re ready to begin a project. Install prompts were clear and easy to understand."]},"id":"ed5e7033-cf81-4ad7-823b-5a901b6f328b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"277b4309-a1d1-4159-845f-3f39d5b0ab43","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ImTOO DVD Copy Express is the perfect, streamlined DVD copy and backup program – no mess, no frills – it just does what it says.
