You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The majority of the <a href=\"/best-backup-camera\">backup cameras</a> that we reviewed were wireless models that use receivers and transmitters to send video from the camera to the display. While this is convenient for installation, it dramatically increases the cost of your camera without necessarily adding functionality beyond installation. Products like the Chuanganzhuo Backup Camera and Monitor Kit opt for a wired connection to offer many of the same features of a premium backup camera at a fraction of the price. That said, the cost of installing these wired backup cameras can easily outweigh the savings.","These features include night vision, a wide field of view, water resistance and more. The &#39;camera doesn&#39;t have true night vision per se, but rather the use of infrared LEDs and a camera with an infrared sensor. Regardless of the mechanism, the result is the same. ","Field of view refers to the width of your camera&#39;s viewing angle. Cameras with a wider-angled lens can capture more of your surroundings to give you a more complete idea of what&#39;s around you. At 170 degrees, this rear-view camera kit offers the widest field of view currently available in a backup camera. Only the<a href=\"/pyle-plcm7500-review\"> Pyle PLCM7500</a> and another <a href=\"/chuanganzhuo-review\">Chuanganzhuo</a> model have the same field of view. Just keep in mind that wide angles are subject to some fish-eye distortion. If that&#39;s something you dislike, you might consider opting for a camera with a narrower field of view.","Installing this backup camera isn&#39;t too difficult, but since it&#39;s not wireless, you&#39;ll have to find a way to run cords the length of your vehicle while keeping them concealed and protected. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no standard way to do this – it&#39;s totally dependent on your vehicle.","Aside from installation, there&#39;s no significant downside to going with this camera. It&#39;s cheap and effective. It&#39;s display and picture quality aren&#39;t anything special, but they&#39;re average, and honestly, spending more doesn&#39;t necessarily equate to higher quality in that regard anyway. It&#39;s just not a focus for rear-view cameras."]},"id":"b32a0652-c36d-46cb-8ca6-ca02283a4b3b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1024d447-c37d-4294-b500-f2d9a9b2a889","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Chuanganzhuo Backup Camera and Monitor Kit is an inexpensive yet functional rear-view camera system.
