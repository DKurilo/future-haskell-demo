What most people do not realize is that WM Capture also has the right tools to record quality in-game video footage. WM Capture has most of the features that we look for in the best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-free-gameplay-recording-software,review-4657.html\">game recording software</a>; however, it doesn&#39;t allow you to record video at custom resolutions, and the lack of hotkeys is baffling.","One of the most powerful features of WM Capture is its ability to capture streaming video. Combine that with real-time audio and video recording, and this software lets you capture just about everything you can put on your monitor. Another nice aspect is that, if you just want a quick recording, the software gives you a small window with recording and playback controls, as well as allowing you to view recently recorded files.","WM Capture affects in-game performance more than most of the video game capture software we tested. While recording 1080p video, we noted a decrease of 12 percent in performance. For 720p video, the performance decrease was 11 percent. While these are not large numbers, they&#39;re considerably higher than those of the best game capture applications, which affect in-game performance by as little as 4 percent. Check out our testing methodology to learn how we got our numbers.","If you want to include audio with your video, you can add a voiceover via microphone. Unfortunately, WM Capture frequently has a hard time balancing the incoming audio from the microphone with a game&#39;s SFX, often resulting in the SFX drowning out any voice recording.","In the lower right-hand corner of the application, there is a button with a question mark on it. This button directs you to the online user guide. This guide contains detailed information about the software and is a good place to start if you run into issues with the game recording software. It&#39;s easy to find the information you need in the guide, thanks to its easy navigation.","If the user guide doesn&#39;t have the answers you need, you can look to the user forums for even more help. There is a good chance that searching the forum may show you that someone else has encountered similar problems and how they resolved them. Many video game recording software support sites don&#39;t have user forums, which is unfortunate, as they are an excellent help resource."]},"id":"1e234dc1-95d9-442f-a3a7-b9a2f9e66b79","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7ef76461-0c1d-4d5e-b74d-6e83cc741e06","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["WM Capture is good game recording software and does just about everything well.
