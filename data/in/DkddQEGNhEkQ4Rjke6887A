Active Junky tested this sleeping bag on multiple camping trips in Utah and Colorado, including one impromptu winter backpacking trip above the snow line. They found it kept them cozy even as temperatures plummeted below freezing.","This sleeping bag features a pad sleeve that not only fit several pads but also had enough room inside the bag that you can turn over in your sleep without having to readjust the pad. It has stretch fabric panels on the side to accommodate different thicknesses as well. The sleeve was among the favorite features with the Active Junky testers.","While carrying it on your back, weight is a concern, but size matters, too – especially when you are trying to squeeze a too-big body into a too-short bag. The Big Agnes Summit Park weights about 4.5 pounds, a good weight, considering ultralights are 2 pounds or less. Nonetheless, hikers as tall as 6’5” found the bag comfortable and spacious.","The truly favorite feature, however, was the DownTek loft. The Summit Park 15 is filled with 600-fill power down was extremely water resistant; testers found that condensation failed to infiltrate the loftiness of the bag, and the quilted baffles never yielded cold spots.","If you are not big or tall, you may end up drowning in this bag. However, it’s big enough for smaller campers to place a second mummy inside it, making it an ideal addition for extreme cold conditions.","Unless you don’t fit well in a standard sleeping bag, the bulk of the model makes it better suited for car camping or when extreme cold requires a heavy-duty bag.","<strong>Tester Comment:</strong> If Bigfoot had a sleeping bag – and kept getting cold – this would be the model to carry around. Luxury is the game here, with basecamp warmth ideal for climbers and skiers making day trips.<br/><strong>Key Feature: </strong>Spacious<br/><strong>Best For: </strong>Road trips, car camping, winter camping, use as an outer bag, large or tall people<br/><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>For large or tall people needing an extra roomy sleeping bag or for those needing a warm outer bag for extreme cold conditions, the Big Agnes Summit Park 15 does an excellent job of providing comfort and warmth."]},"id":"636786c2-f5aa-4605-a5f4-6f6e0f5179ab","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68164","url":"/big-agnes-summit-park-15-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-02T18:58:02Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T18:58:02Z","name":"Big Agnes Summit Park 15","synopsis":"If you are you a big person who needs a big sleeping bag, the Big Agnes Summit Park 15 can give you a comfortable sleep even in the coldest temperatures.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"If you are you a big person who needs a big sleeping bag, the Big Agnes Summit Park 15 can give you a comfortable sleep even in the coldest temperatures.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-08-02T19:46:55Z","id":"DkddQEGNhEkQ4Rjke6887A","meta":{"title":"Big Agnes Summit Park 15 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Big Agnes Summit Park 15 is a great sleeping bag for cold camping, especially for large hikers or as a second sleeping bag for extra warmth.
