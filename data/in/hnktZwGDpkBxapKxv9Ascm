It gives you control over multiple audio and video settings and even lets you customize the player skin and share comments on videos directly to your social media pages. It’s also one of the least expensive Blu-ray player options available, so while it’s missing some features, it’s a great value if you want basic software.","This movie player software is available for Windows and Mac operating systems, but not for Linux. For just a bit more than the individual software cost, you can buy a license for both Windows and Mac OS X if you have multiple computers you&#39;ll want to watch videos on. Macgo makes watching your entire movie collection easy, as it can play a variety of physical and digital video formats, including AVI, MP4, MOV, MKV and WMV. During our testing, we liked how seamless the player was at switching between video types, never once lagging or buffering.","Just because you&#39;re using your computer as a video player rather than a physical player doesn&#39;t mean its performance or usability should suffer. As we tested the Macgo player, we found the software to be easy and enjoyable to use. Menus and icons are easy to find and understand, and any adjustments you could think of making are easy to do within a few clicks, so you don&#39;t have to waste time. Digital video started playing fairly quickly, and discs took barely ten seconds to load and start playing (the fastest time we recorded was <a href=\"/aiseesoft-blu-ray-player-review\">Aiseesoft Blu-ray Player</a> at five seconds). We also liked that the player has a minimalistic and intuitive interface.","Whether you&#39;re watching a treasured DVD or a new digital movie file, the player lets you stretch the time of your video or adjust the hue, saturation and brightness of the picture. However, we were disappointed to see that Macgo&#39;s player software does not offer BD-Live support or a touchscreen interface capacity for Windows users. The fact that it doesn&#39;t seem to have any power manager options to save your battery life is also a drawback, especially considering its uses 45 percent of your CPU.","Probably the most compelling aspect of this software is the price. At the time of this writing, you can purchase Macgo Blu-ray Player for less than $30. Compare that to our top pick, PowerDVD Ultra, which costs almost $80. If you don’t need all the extras that come with that, Macgo is your best bet, and it saves you 50 bucks.","Macgo is excellent Blu-ray player software that allows you to optimize the picture and audio quality, connect with social media, and even change regions as needed. It also has helpful customer service that lets you get back to watching your favorite flicks quickly."]},"id":"88190fcc-9b31-4fb8-97ac-16b696999956","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57704","url":"/macgo-blu-ray-player-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
