They are made from steel wire and provide even support for your entire body. The construction of the springs is designed to promote airflow so the mattress stays fresh and clean.","The upholstered top layer of this pocket-sprung mattress is made from a blend of polyurethane foam, polyester and fiber wadding. It is a tight top mattress, meaning it does not have an extra layer of cushioning on top like pillow top mattresses. Thus, the mattress is only available in firm, so it is best suited for individuals who prefer a stiffer mattress top. The firmness of the mattress can also provide pressure-point relief if you suffer from aches and pains due to your current mattress’s lack of support.","The Ikea Sultan Havberg spring mattress is remarkably lightweight and thin, particularly compared to many brand-name spring mattresses. The mattress is roll packed and weighs only 44 pounds, making it easy to transport.","Given the simplicity and price point of this spring mattress, it’s hardly surprising that it’s only available in three sizes: twin, full and queen. While the lack of a king size alternative is slightly disappointing, the size options suffice for most single sleepers."]},"id":"4a813b0e-4a75-405c-87fc-78ece607f4b5","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/4S2X7YSXqdPR9RaJPsjSFL.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58399-ikea-sultan-havberg1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4S2X7YSXqdPR9RaJPsjSFL.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"4S2X7YSXqdPR9RaJPsjSFL","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4S2X7YSXqdPR9RaJPsjSFL.jpg","alt":""},"id":"3a3058e1-cfc3-494e-b413-01483f8c64e3","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For most people, a mattress constitutes a long-term investment so it’s important to look for one that comes with a lengthy warranty.

The Ikea Sultan Havberg lacks a plush pillow top so it’s a good alternative only if you like your mattress to be extra firm.
