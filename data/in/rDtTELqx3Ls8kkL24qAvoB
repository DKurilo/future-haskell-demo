This allows you to charge your devices on the go without being tethered to an outlet. The charger supports both wireless and wired charging.","The charging pad has a power output of 5 volts, and with a 4,800 mAh rechargeable battery onboard, you can still juice up while you are on the move.","The charger is white and made entirely of plastic. It is surprisingly thin for having a built-in battery. It has rounded edges and its dimensions are 2.95 x 0.55 x 5.39 inches. This wireless phone charger is portable â€“ it is even small enough to fit in a pocket. It isn&#39;t too heavy either and weighs in at only 80 grams.","Included in the box you get both a microUSB cable and an AC adapter. The cord will charge the built-in battery, or you can keep it plugged in indefinitely if you wish. The cable is a little more than 3 feet long. You cannot charge the built-in battery wirelessly.","The wireless charger works with Qi-enabled smartphones. It can be tricky at times to get your device to begin the charging process. It has to be lined up in the right spot to start wirelessly charging. There&#39;s also a USB port on the side of the charger, so you can charge anything that you can connect with the USB cable. However, you aren&#39;t able to concurrently charge a smartphone wirelessly and another device with the USB port.","To let you know how full of a charge the built-in battery has, there is a row of six indicator lights which will illuminate as your charge progresses. However, they are so bright that they bleed into one another, and it ends up being confusing and hard to tell how charged the bank is. Other indicator lights give you more information about the device. Red indicates that the unit is on, four blues lights show the charge level and a green one blinks when the device is charging. You also will get an audible high-pitched beep when your phone makes contact and starts to charge.","The charger has a one-year warranty in case anything goes wrong. The company also offers a FAQs page and has telephone and email support if you need it."]},"id":"dc863e01-086a-4f58-802f-514feebf98dd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fbe13312-db66-4a7b-9e41-4deb26e0dbbc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Mugenizer N11 is a nifty charger.
