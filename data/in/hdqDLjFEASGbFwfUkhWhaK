Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Two years ago, HTC legitimized its position in the flagship phone market with the release of the HTC One. Better known today as the One M7, the smartphone stormed onto the scene with a gorgeous screen, solid internal specs and the best craftsmanship ever seen in an Android device. The lone complaint you could levy against the M7 was that its camera was subpar. Last year&#39;s One M8 boasted improved internal components, an even better screen, a perfected design and the same disappointing camera.","This year’s new HTC One M9 is a gorgeous phone, featuring a near-identical design to last year&#39;s M8 and equally superb build quality. Its internal components received a big boost, and right now it&#39;s arguably the best-specced phone you can buy. Its screen remains beautiful, its operating system is streamlined and the camera has finally been upgraded. Still, there&#39;s nothing revolutionary or terribly exciting here, and even with its improvements, the camera still falls flat. The HTC One M9 is a great phone. It&#39;s almost superb, but it&#39;s not quite there."]},"id":"0a9fa040-90f2-47fb-bfcc-2faf8262f2ed","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"96264b1a-810f-4456-9bad-13aac0d5b318","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/GbDc2hZzfptGsjZKBdWkV6.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/55416-htc-one6.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GbDc2hZzfptGsjZKBdWkV6.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"GbDc2hZzfptGsjZKBdWkV6","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GbDc2hZzfptGsjZKBdWkV6.jpg","alt":""},"id":"2c08ff67-8857-4098-9e2c-66207e65fd82","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We could gripe about the HTC One M9&#39;s similarity to last year&#39;s M8, but it&#39;s still one of the nicest Android phones we&#39;ve ever held.
