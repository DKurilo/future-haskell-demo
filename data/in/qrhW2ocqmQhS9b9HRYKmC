You can make a reasonably large batch of <a href=\"https://www.courtneyssweets.com/air-fryer-baked-garlic-parsley-potatoes/\">baked potatoes</a>, for instance. We like the idea of doing a batch of <a href=\"https://airfryer.cooking/hard-boiled-eggs/\">eggs</a> in the air fryer too. You don&#39;t even have to bother with water. You can also do your <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/thanksgiving/a22716913/air-fryer-thanksgiving-turkey-recipe/\">Thanksgiving turkey</a> in an air fryer as long as you are not expecting a big crowd.","As long as you keep small quantities in mind, you can have a lot of fun making a few <a href=\"https://www.meredithlaurence.com/recipes/cinnamon-rolls/\">different baked goods</a> in your air fryer as well. Some models come with baking cups and other accessories to facilitate lots of variety in your projects."]},"id":"b21e11f7-ede3-4329-b4c6-ade4e3cb944d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_268","url":"/best-air-fryers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angela-parkinson","url":"/author/angela-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Angela Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4mNVTVXMirWtTXf6QMhCjd","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-04T16:19:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-04T16:19:00Z","name":"Best Air Fryers of 2019","synopsis":"We made multiple batches of chicken wings and fries with 10 different air fryers for a week.
