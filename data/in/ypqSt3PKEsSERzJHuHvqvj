Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/software/privacy/best-personal-firewall-software/\">Personal Firewall Software</a> here.</em>","Comodo Internet Security is a free firewall program that is very easy to setup and includes an impressive tool set, and while many big-name internet security companies are located outside of the U.S., Comodo is based in New Jersey. Comodo is a Windows firewall and is compatible with Android smartphones and tablets. There is a paid version, but the only real difference is access to 24/7 live support.","The Comodo firewall is automatically enabled when you install the program, but you can adjust the settings so you have more than basic protection. Some of the options include blocking popup alerts and running in safe mode. Its virus protection is very good; it earned a perfect score from AV-Tests for being able to quickly identify and block malware threats, including unknown viruses and ransomware. It had a little trouble noticing legitimate programs and tagged several as potential threats.","During our own testing we noticed that Comodo Internet Security uses a lot of your computer’s resources, slowing your system down a lot during important functions, such as virus and vulnerability scans. We especially noticed that our computer lagged a lot when trying to load popular websites such as Facebook and online news outlets. We also noticed a delay while playing several online games. However, Comodo does have a silent mode that suspends a lot of its activities so you’re not interrupted with so much lag when you work online. You do have to enable this mode yourself since this firewall software can’t automatically sense when it needs to turn this on. If you feel that you need a program that doesn&#39;t cause so much lag, consider <a href=\"/avira-review\">Avira</a>, which also is a free personal firewall program.","Comodo Internet Security includes a virtual keyboard that masks your user name, passwords, account numbers and credit card information while you are working, shopping and banking online. This makes it more difficult for hackers to use cookies, keyloggers, spyware and bots to swipe personal information, access financial records or track your online habits. There’s also a specific Safe Shopping tool so you can log in to online stores, including eBay and Amazon, and be further protected from online snoops.","This firewall software scans your computer network and lets you know if it finds any weak points, which are typically found in outdated software programs. These are the most common areas where hackers and bots push through into your computer and infect it with ransomware, spyware, keyloggers, Trojans, rootkits and other harmful malware. Knowing where your weak points are lets you update applications and seal off those vulnerable spots.","One service Comodo offers is its File Rating. If someone sends you an attachment, or if you find a downloadable file online or discover an unknown file on your computer, you can send a link or upload the file to Comodo and it will compare it to its extensive database of internet threats and let you know if it is safe to open.","Comodo Internet Security is a good choice for free firewall protection. It is compatible with Windows and includes additional security features such as virus protection and safe shopping tools. It does slow down your system quite a bit while running, though you can enable the silent mode during some tasks if you choose, such as downloading programs or playing online games."]},"id":"cb358ab7-4890-4f8c-bc9d-acf6d9eefcc5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49821","url":"/comodo-internet-security-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-06-16T21:01:11Z","datePublished":"2010-06-16T21:01:11Z","name":"Comodo Internet Security Premium 10","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":58,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-10-04T00:00:00Z","id":"ypqSt3PKEsSERzJHuHvqvj","meta":{"title":"Comodo Internet Security Pro 7 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our review to see how Comodo Internet Security&#8217;s free firewall protection compares to other firewall software."},"products":[{"slug":"comodo-internet-security-premium-10","url":"/product/comodo-internet-security-premium-10","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:28:45Z","name":"Comodo Internet Security Premium 10","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:28:45Z","id":"ZqwWSbyhaAKoSjm93cuDBM","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:28:45Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/bCWK9XEfHDqAFVviMZbqr9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:28:45Z","mimeType":"","name":"74ab5cfa5a8d8aec85bd7dbd30f2d4da.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/74ab5cfa5a8d8aec85bd7dbd30f2d4da.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:28:45Z","id":"bCWK9XEfHDqAFVviMZbqr9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bCWK9XEfHDqAFVviMZbqr9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Comodo Internet Security Pro 7 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our review to see how Comodo Internet Security&#8217;s free firewall protection compares to other firewall software."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/bCWK9XEfHDqAFVviMZbqr9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:28:45Z","mimeType":"","name":"74ab5cfa5a8d8aec85bd7dbd30f2d4da.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/74ab5cfa5a8d8aec85bd7dbd30f2d4da.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:28:45Z","id":"bCWK9XEfHDqAFVviMZbqr9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bCWK9XEfHDqAFVviMZbqr9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Comodo Internet Security Pro 7 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our review to see how Comodo Internet Security&#8217;s free firewall protection compares to other firewall software."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/software/privacy/best-personal-firewall-software/comodo-internet-security-pro-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:28:45Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:28:45Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"web-security","url":"/electronics/web-security","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:28:45Z","name":"Web Security","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:28:45Z","id":"okw7vafYKJTqevVdgGseBe","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
