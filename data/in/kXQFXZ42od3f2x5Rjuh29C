You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Brookstone Mighty Max is a well-designed, oscillating <a href=\"/best-tower-fans\">tower fan</a> with a modern look. It stands on a wide base, ensuring it won&#39;t tip over easily. The bulk of the tower is constructed of a soft, steeled-gray plastic, while the top houses an easy-to-read LCD display covered by a deeper gray. This LCD display is bright in dark rooms and does not feature a dimming option, which can be a problem if you are bothered by bright lights when you try to sleep.","This affordable tower fan oscillates 90 degrees, so if you place it in a corner to function as a floor fan, it can cover the whole room. It also works well as a standing fan on top of an above-floor surface. The Brookstone Mighty Max has three different speeds to choose from and runs quietly on the lower speeds, but it blows louder on the maximum speed. One nice feature of this tower fan is the three program modes: Breeze, Sleep and Normal. These preprogrammed settings automatically adjust the airspeed for you and are a nice convenience.","With an energy-saving timer, you can set the fan to run for one, two, four or eight hours. The included remote is sleek and fits snuggly into a slot on the top of the fan, although it does not come with batteries. The Mighty Max has as a decibel level of 68, which is about average for tower fans this size. It blows up to 1100 CFM (cubic feet per minute) of air, enough to cool a medium or unobstructed large room effectively.","The design of this fan is sturdy, standing 34 inches tall while it is 11 inches both wide and long. It is relatively easy to move, weighing just over 14 pounds, and the built-in handle makes it easier to position and move the fan. Brookstone’s email response time is swift, and representatives give helpful, courteous answers. They also provide great phone customer support. Unlike the <a href=\"/vornado-tower-circulator-review\">Vornado Tower 184</a>&#39;s five-year warranty, the fan only comes with an industry-standard one-year warranty. As for support materials, there is a downloadable owner’s manual and a FAQs page to help answer questions on the product page."]},"id":"0b25a075-c2ca-41ee-8bad-a19274eea6e0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7c2d1595-c38b-4299-ba18-501a020ba2eb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Brookstone Mighty Max is a good-looking, reliable, oscillating tower fan.
