As a parent, you&#39;re going to want to make sure they&#39;re getting not only fun gifts, but educational ones, as well. The nabi Jr. tablet is geared towards education and grows with your child. There are hundreds of different things for a kid to do on the nabi Jr. that are not only fun, but educational, so you won&#39;t feel guilty when you let them play with it for hours.","This tablet features not only Wi-Fi, but also Bluetooth connectivity, which is rare in kids tablets. This tablet runs on the Android 4.0 operating system and features a Nvidia Tegra dual-core processor. Android creates user-friendly – and in this case kid-friendly – operating systems, so there won&#39;t be a steep learning curve when your child first starts using the nabi Jr.","The 4GB of included storage is a drawback because you won&#39;t be able to store much media. If you have a child who takes photos, draws pictures or downloads videos and apps, you&#39;ll find that 4GB fills up quickly. On the plus side, there is an expandable microSD port where you can add up to 32GB of storage. The 5-inch display has an 800 x 480 resolution. This isn&#39;t anything amazing, but it&#39;s fine for a first-time tablet.","The nabi Jr. features an educational game called Wings. This interactive game includes stories and more that you can personalize for your young one. In this game children can work on their math, reading and writing skills in a fun way. Wings covers these skills from pre-K through 6th grade with over 3,000 different lessons, and the N-Site parental dashboard will allow you to see the progress your child is making. This device also comes with over 30 preloaded games and apps designed just for kids. The parental controls allow you to filter web content and monitor your child by setting time restraints.","A fun feature of this children&#39;s tablet is the flip camera. It can only take 2MP photos and 720p video, but it flips 180-degrees. So, you don&#39;t get two cameras, but you get one that will swivel between front and back. The nabi Jr. tablet includes a protective feature called the Drop-Safe bumper which protects the device from bumps, drops and even sticky fingers.","Some of the disadvantages to this tablet are the customer service and battery. The customer service seems to always direct people toward Facebook, which can be off-putting to some. The battery life is only around five hours, and it takes about that long to charge it.","If you&#39;re buying a gift for a tech-loving child, or are just looking for an entertaining tool to supplement your child&#39;s education, you&#39;ll love this kids tablet. What it&#39;s lacking in storage and battery life, it makes up for in apps and the camera. Overall, this would make a great holiday gift for that little someone in your life."]},"id":"a35a4f8f-c57b-40b3-a4af-a7b24201c098","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58101","url":"/nabi-jr-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-11T17:26:54Z","datePublished":"2013-11-11T17:26:54Z","name":"Fuhu nabi, Jr.","synopsis":"As the holiday season approaches, your kids are going to ask for the best holiday gifts and the newest gadgets on the market.
