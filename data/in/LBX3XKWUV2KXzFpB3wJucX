Unlike the centrifugal juicers we tested in the same price range, this unit uses an auger to grind fruits and vegetables into juice. The centrifugal units have a central spinning blade that shreds produce. Some think that the heat generated with spinning is detrimental to the nutritional value of the final juice. That’s one very good reason to take a good long look at the Aicook Slow Masticating Juicer. It wasn’t quite as good as the other masticating juicers we tested, but we weren’t overly impressed with either of them. ","There were only two juicers that achieved less froth-free juice than the Aicook and those are the kind that just shred whole vegetables and fruits into more of a smoothie, not juice. One of the advertised benefits of masticating juicers is that they go slow to get a high quantity of best-quality juice. That’s not what we found with the Aicook, at least in terms of quantity. It produced comparatively little juice and left a moist pulp, which indicates lots of juice was left unused in the pulp. ","One definite plus is that this juicer has a very low price so it’s a budget-friendly way to get into this style of juicing. We’ve tried more expensive versions of masticating juicers over the years and they did seem much more sturdy. This one shakes and has spikes in sound every time you put in a piece of beet. ","Since this juicer is smaller than other budget-level slow juicers you can conserve more counter space. This style of juicer comes with more parts to clean and assemble, though, so that adds to the time needed for juicing. This machine comes with a three-year warranty, which is rather impressive, especially for its low price. ","The Aicook Slow Masticating Juicer is not the best juicer we tried. But it does offer a budget-friendly way to get into slow juicing."]},"id":"77ff7269-ff70-48ec-b229-a532867525ac","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70390","url":"/aicook-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-21T22:26:46Z","datePublished":"2019-03-21T22:26:46Z","name":"Aicook","synopsis":"The Aicook Slow Masticating Juicer is a decent entry-level slow juicer that offered mixed results.
