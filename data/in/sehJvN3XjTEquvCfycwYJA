It holds the charging port and the only button, which you use to pair the headset. The device has to be in the pod to charge or pair, which can be annoying. Besides acting as a home base for the earpiece, the pod can also hold up to three charges for the earpiece, which is great for charging on the go. The charging aspect of the pod is pretty necessary, considering that you can only expect three to four hours of talk time or three days of standby from each charge. This is the shortest battery life of any headset we tested, so the Eclipse is best suited to more periodic use than other headsets – like the <a href=\"/mobile/accessories/best-bluetooth-headsets/motorola-review/\">Motorola Boom 2+</a> – that have more talk time.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/69100-jabra-eclipse7.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sGf3nDYqqzdW6ezumSy79o.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"sGf3nDYqqzdW6ezumSy79o","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sGf3nDYqqzdW6ezumSy79o.jpg","alt":""},"id":"53cd2b17-1d2c-4828-948d-37e4a2bcad13","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At just six grams, the Jabra Eclipse is the lightest of the products we tested, but it doesn’t feel light in a cheap way.
