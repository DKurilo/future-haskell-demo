The binoculars have 9x magnification and a wide field of view at 117 meters, meaning you can track fast-paced action at a sporting event or nimble birds as they zip through the air. The objective lenses, the large lenses furthest away from your eyes, are 32 millimeters in diameter, which means you experience the brightest images in well-lit areas. Viewing objects in low-light settings is more difficult.","During our testing process, we conducted a survey in which participants were asked to rate the optical qualities of each pair of binoculars. In general with the Pentax AD, our participants found that close objects were easier to focus on, while objects farther away were more difficult to see clearly. According to the participants, the farther away the object they were trying to view, the shakier the image became, especially compared to our top-rated binoculars. It&#39;s important to note that your experience may differ.","This pair of binoculars uses high-quality BAK-4 prisms that produce sharp, edge-to-edge images. Because the Pentax AD has the roof prism design, it has phase correction coatings to diminish blurry images. The lenses are multicoated so less light reflects off the glass and away from your eyes. This feature helps produce bright, sharp images.","While our survey participants examined the optical quality of these binoculars, they found they were comfortable to use and easy to adjust. This is largely due to the lightweight design of only 17.6 ounces, making them easy to hold for a good length of time before your arms start to tire. Unfortunately, this set of binoculars is not tripod adaptable, so you have to keep a steady hand while you look through them to get the most stable images. However, the binoculars are both waterproof and fogproof, so you don&#39;t have to worry about using them out in the elements. These features and their lightweight design make them excellent for use on the trail.","Pentax offers a lifetime guarantee that protects you from manufacturer defects in material or workmanship. If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact the company through email or over the phone. You can also check out the company&#39;s FAQs page to see if there are answers to your questions."]},"id":"eba641d2-a2b6-40e3-b2a8-d2ad527c8ccc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2084478b-3d00-4291-b507-b4be9e45e28f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pentax AD 9x32 is a small set of binoculars that&#39;s good for use while you travel or hike the trail.
