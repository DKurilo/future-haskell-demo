We take the time and resources to dig beyond surface-level marketing materials to find the features and flaws of each product. As reviewers, we are insulated from sales and marketing to make sure our impressions are impartial. Our recommendations are based on our impression of the services while researching them as overly-thorough consumers.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>  ","For small business phone services, we spent hours compiling a list of common and unique features for each product. We then contacted customer service teams to test that each service provides the necessary support to troubleshoot and solve problems for managers of a business that may not have dedicated IT support. The last step in our evaluation process was to analyze the features and support data alongside a list of concerns commonly raised by small business managers. This process helped us recommend a product that suits the needs of the wide-ranging customer base of small businesses.","<strong>Important Features for Small Business Phone Systems  </strong>","Stable Mobile Application<br/>All the services we evaluated have companion apps that allow you to initiate and receive calls and messages on your mobile devices. We recommend trialing the accompanying apps before making a final decision about which phone service you choose. Verified customer reviews are a good resource to find out how reliable apps are and if the manufacturer is willing to fix frequently reported issues.","Virtual vs Hardware Infrastructure<br/>If you have a workforce that needs the flexibility of an office phone but also works remotely on mobile devices, avoid a virtual platform like Grasshopper. Virtual systems work well for remote employees and businesses with less than five employees but don’t offer the stability and features of traditional VoIP services like Vonage. Virtual platforms are heavily reliant on stable Wi-Fi and cellular networks because most of the interactions are on smartphones, where VoIP services utilize secure high-speed networks as the transmission medium.","Help and Support<br/>Small businesses that rely heavily on phone systems need a knowledgeable customer service rep available to quickly fix everyday issues. Most services we reviewed offer 24/7 customer support, but some have limited office hours that may not align with your availability.   ","<br/>"]},"id":"f4be7517-994a-4cc0-a2a8-6a5fc50ce24a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_379","url":"/best-small-business-phone-systems","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-07T18:58:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-07T18:58:00Z","name":"Best Small Business Phone Systems of 2019","synopsis":"Starting a small business can be difficult, but managing your phone system shouldn't be.
