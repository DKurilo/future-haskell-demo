You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This low-profile <a href=\"/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse\">wireless keyboard and mouse</a> combo instantly became one of the favorites among our reviewer group. The low-profile, concaved keys provide the platform for speedy yet accurate typing, and the keyboard contains a handful of media keys and shortcuts you&#39;d expect from on the best wireless keyboard and mouse combos.","The keyboard is one of the most portable in our comparison. It measures 17.8 x 7.0 x 0.8 inches (L x W x H) and only weighs 1.2 pounds. This is a slim and lightweight keyboard. Others in our lineup are over 10 inches wide and 3 inches tall, and they can weigh up to 4 pounds. When you are traveling with your keyboard and mouse, every inch and ounce count.","The keyboard is slim and features low-profile keys. It resembles the chiclet-style keyboard you&#39;d expect from a laptop, but the keys are slightly concaved, closer together and softer upon impact. The low-profile keys and 2.2 mm actuation point make this keyboard a great choice for speedy typists.","If there is one downfall to the keyboard it is the battery life. Anker claims that this wireless keyboard only lasts up to two months on a single AAA battery. To give some perspective, other keyboards can last up to three years on a single set of batteries.","The Anker wireless mouse is equally as impressive as the keyboard. On all surfaces, this mouse performed well in our tests. This included wood, laminate, denim, carpet, marble and glass. On the glass surface is the only time we noticed any sort of lagging in the mouse&#39;s responsiveness, but not much. You can feel confident that this mouse will perform regardless of the surface.","To determine our comfort score, we had a group of reviewers use the mouse for an extended period. After we gathered all of the data, it became apparent that this is a well-designed mouse regardless of hand size. The mouse has a large arch for your palm to sit comfortably. It is also wide enough to fill up the entirety of your palm, which enhances the comfort.","Unfortunately, it isn&#39;t ideal for lefties since it isn&#39;t ambidextrous. There is a grip on one side of the mouse for your thumb along with additional buttons above the right-hand thumb area. The buttons make for an awkward grip when holding the mouse with your left hand.","Two great design attributes are the four-way scrolling and DPI button on the mouse. By pressing the spin wheel to the left or right, you can navigate content horizontally as well as vertically.","The DPI button changes the sensitivity of the mouse. In other words, it speeds up or slows down the cursor. It is convenient to have this setting right on the mouse. The button sits behind the spin wheel. When you adjust the DPI, three lights above the DPI button will flash to indicate which speed the cursor is set to – one light for the slowest setting, two for medium and three for the most sensitive DPI and fastest cursor speed","Anker covers this wireless mouse and keyboard unit with an 18-month warranty. On the company website, you&#39;ll find support options such as phone, email and FAQs should you need any assistance or help with your wireless combo. One thing to note is that this wireless mouse and keyboard combo does not come with batteries. You&#39;ll need to purchase a AA and AAA battery separately.","Anker impressed a lot of our reviewers with its low-profile yet responsive keyboard and comfortable, versatile mouse. The keyboard has the look of a laptop keyboard, but it sports concaved and comfortable keys like a mechanical keyboard. The unit is also ultra-portable with its slim and lightweight design. This is a great option for a wireless keyboard and mouse combo."]},"id":"0cd27c29-ab9f-4d86-8a58-5ab701e351c7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68139","url":"/anker-wireless-mouse-keyboard-combo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-01T17:56:03Z","datePublished":"2016-08-01T17:56:03Z","name":"Anker Wireless Mouse & Keyboard Combo","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":35,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-08-01T17:56:03Z","id":"wT2SHrYGhyQopCYkuTLFjn","meta":{"title":"Anker Wireless Mouse & Keyboard Combo Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Anker Wireless Mouse &amp; Keyboard Combo is a great choice for speedy users who appreciate portability.
