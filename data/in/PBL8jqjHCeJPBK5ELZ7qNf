The patented SpinScrub brushes are one of the things that set this machine apart from other <a href=\"/best-carpet-cleaners\">carpet cleaners</a>. SpinScrub technology uses a set of six independent brushes instead of just one roller bar to clean your carpets.","The hand tool of this carpet shampooer is also equipped with the SpinScrub brush technology. You can easily add the SpinScrub brush to the hose so you can clean stairs and upholstery. The handle brush comes with two spinning brushes that will help you whisk away dirt from your old chair in a matter of minutes. Having this technology readily available will also decrease the amount of hard work you have to put into the job, allowing you to clean with ease.","Hoover also offers the Dual V Nozzle on this model of their carpet cleaners, which means that there is equal suction throughout the width of the nozzle. This technology ensures that you will not find damp spots in your carpet after you have cleaned them. This nozzle is also easy to remove from the machine so you can clean it.","The Hoover MaxExtract All Terrain has a weight of 30-pounds. However, this carpet shampooer is equipped with a handle so you can easily transport it from one location to another. This comes in handy for carrying it up or down the stairs.","One of the features that we like about this carpet cleaning machine is that it has a wide cleaning path of 13-inches. With such a wide cleaning path, you can get more done in a shorter amount of time.","The Hoover MaxExtract All Terrain comes with a standard one-year warranty. We were able to easily locate a customer service number and email address for questions. Hoover also includes a user guide for each unit they sell, and video tutorials are available on their website."]},"id":"793a048a-b0db-4f20-a896-b85d7079728f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a699eae1-5a91-45b2-9f95-42ccc82c420f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Hoover MaxExtract All Terrain has features such as the SpinScrub brush technology and a removable Dual V nozzle for easy cleaning.
