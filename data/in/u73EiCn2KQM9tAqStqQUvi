However, the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-4.html\">sport earbuds</a> are not as secure as over-the-ear models.","Soft silicone nozzle-fit earbuds fit firmly into your ear to seal in sound. The malleable ear pieces are also more likely to keep the headphones in your ears than their hard plastic counterparts, and they are more comfortable if you have small ears. The ear pieces come in small and medium to help customize the fit, although the silicone design means that they will mold and fit well, no matter what your ear canal size.","The one-button remote control does not offer much in terms of functionality, but it does allow you to pause and play music as needed. The rubber cable also includes an inline microphone, allowing you to talk to callers on a cellphone without taking it out of your pocket.","A sweat proof design is suitable for heavy sports, and they do not damage in light rain. The Gumy Sport earbuds are not noise canceling, but they do offer noise insulation, so they are also suitable to wear outdoors and around cars.","The 10Hz to 20kHz frequency response, 16-ohm impedance and 103-decibel sensitivity make the sport earbuds a midrange option in terms of sound quality. That being said, they are still good enough for most types of sports, where you might not notice sound dynamics anyway.","Multiple colors are available to match your music player or phone. The sweat-resistant earbuds also work well with iPhone, Android and Blackberry phones, as well as a range of dedicated music players, although the remote does not work with every device.","The 3.3-foot color cord is long enough to allow you to store your music player in a back pocket. The cord does not come with a clip, but it works well under your shirt or with a cord pin to keep it from bouncing around.","While simple in design, the JVC Gumy Sport earbuds are a good option if you participate in low- to medium-impact sports, where you are less likely to lose your headphones. However, with no over-the-ear wire, they may still come out of your ears during runs, boxing or other medium- to high-impact activity."]},"id":"f344366d-7df3-4f2d-a14c-b4f75dbdf24a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63398","url":"/jvc-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-10T21:48:35Z","datePublished":"2015-03-10T21:48:35Z","name":"JVC Gumy Sport In-Ear Headphones with Mic","synopsis":"The JCV Gumy Sport are sweat and water resistant earbuds with soft nozzle-fit earpieces, an inline remote and mic.
