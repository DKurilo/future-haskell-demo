While it&#39;s not the best car subwoofer brand on the market, Boston Acoustics&#39; reputation among audiophiles is well deserved. The G1 series of subwoofers reproduces low-end frequencies accurately with very little distortion. This makes your music sound bigger and feel more realistic, like the band is playing in the car with you. When the bass drum kicks, you feel it in your chest just like at concert. When the bassist slaps the E-string, you hear it clearly even when it&#39;s buried in the mix.","The Boston Acoustics G1 car subwoofer is one of the few subs in our lineup with a frequency response that reaches the basement of human hearing – 20Hz. This makes it a great subwoofer for music with deep-reaching bass. For perspective, the lowest key of a piano is 27Hz. Any music that uses an electronic keyboard or electronic beats often falls to the 20Hz range. This doesn&#39;t necessarily equate to high-quality audio reproduction, though. Fortunately, the G1 subwoofers back up the low frequency with accurate reproduction.","The flaw of the G1 is the 87.4dB sensitivity, which represents the volume you hear at 1 meter from the subwoofer using only 1 watt. This is just below the 88dB average for subwoofers. For comparison, the best car subwoofers have a 96dB, which means the Boston Acoustics G1 subwoofer would need 100 watts to produce the same volume of the best subwoofer using just 12.5 watts of power.","If you&#39;re looking for a subwoofer to blow the socks off your friends and neighbors, the G1 is not your subwoofer. Considering the inefficient 87.4dB sensitivity with the very low 200-watt rating for continuous power handling, you&#39;re dealing with a sub that requires a lot of power to produce significant volumes, with little room to do so without distorting the sound or damaging the woofer. The 200-watt continuous power handling is the lowest among the subwoofers we reviewed. The peak power handling is 800 watts, which does provide significant room for power spikes."]},"id":"a6a726fb-0daf-4a17-a68e-0b15006c6250","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a7faacaa-093d-4c40-b14d-0a8ec28c229d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Boston Acoustics G1 car subwoofers provide high-quality audio with a fully extended frequency response range.
