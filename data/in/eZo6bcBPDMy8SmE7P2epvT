We regularly check with manufacturers for new versions and updates to every program. Over the years, our team of reviewers has spent more than 100 hours testing, rating and ranking Mac video converter programs.","We also asked experts in the video production industry what to look for when choosing video converter software. Drew Tyler, an instructor in the digital media program at Weber State University in Utah, told us that the most important consideration is usability. “Look for ease of use,&#34; he said. &#34;So many factors go into compression. There are people who get paid a lot of money to do it professionally. Look for the software that gives you the presets that are easiest to choose. Avoid the hassle, and let it do the thinking.”","Greg Andersen, of Andersen Media in South Weber, Utah, told us that not all video converters are created equal. Conversion quality is his top consideration, and he only uses applications that retain 100-percent quality.","He said it&#39;s critical to choose software that recognizes and converts to both popular and obscure formats. “The reason for having the correct file format is that there are so many different platforms that require different formats,&#34; Andersen said. &#34;It’s important for me to have a program that is compatible with formats that my client needs. Some want MOV or AVI or MP4, and I need to be able to deliver that, and I need to have a program that’s all-inclusive.”","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Every product we reviewed was subjected to a battery of tests. These tests were designed to gauge how easy each program is to use, how fast it converts and the quality of its final results.","Ease of Use Test<br/>Our reviewers examined every program’s interface and tracked how easy it is to perform basic tasks such as loading a video into the application, selecting output profiles and starting a conversion. We also evaluated each software’s advanced tools, checking to see if they were simple and usable enough to benefit people of all skill levels. The best Mac video converters don’t take long to learn and can be used by anyone, including less tech-savvy individuals.","Quality Test<br/>After converting our test videos, our experts examined the results to find any compression artifact, motion blur, distortion and more. They compared the conversions against the source video to see if any degradation occurred. For the most part, they found minimal quality loss, but some programs were much better than others.","Timing Test<br/>If you’re converting multiple videos, speed is important. We timed how long it takes each program to convert one-, 10- and 60-minute videos and used the results to determine which software is the fastest on average. In general, faster is better, but some programs sacrifice quality for speed. The best applications produced excellent-quality conversions quickly.","<strong>Things to Consider When Choosing Video Converter Software</strong>","When selecting a video converter for your Mac, remember that many video file formats aren&#39;t compatible with Apple applications or products. As such, converting video to the right format is critical. During our review, we found several key features you want to look for when selecting a program:","How Much Does Mac Video Converter Software Cost?<br/>We tested programs between $13 and $70. However, some of the more expensive programs aren’t very good and you’d be better off picking a less expensive and better program. Before you buy, make sure that the program you want has what you need and is the lowest possible price. ","Features<br/>Any Mac converter worth its salt should be able to convert an AVI to an MP4, but the best programs do much more. Features that let you convert in batches, download videos from popular sharing sites like YouTube and Vimeo, and make basic video edits all elevate a simple converter up to a useful application that&#39;s worth the money.","The best Mac video converters also optimize files for specific devices such as <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/best-tablets\">tablets</a> and <a href=\"/best-video-game-consoles\">gaming consoles</a>. The program you choose should also let you create files specifically designed to be shared online.","Compatibility<br/>There are a lot of video formats out there, and it&#39;s not uncommon for even the lowliest video converter to be able to create any popular file type. The best Mac video conversion programs have comprehensive file compatibility for both standard and high-definition videos. They can also create device-specific files for both popular and obscure brands.","Ease of Use<br/>Converting video files used to be a complicated task, but these days, it should be a relatively simple affair. Good Mac video converters have intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces and large device-specific preset libraries. The combination of these features allows you to start converting less than a minute after launching the software.","Help &amp; Support<br/>Even the simplest programs should have lots of customer and technical support options, including an online FAQs page and email contact information. The best applications include live chat support for the fastest possible help.","<strong>What’s the Best Free Video Converter for Mac?</strong>","All the Mac video converters we reviewed are paid programs. We recommend them because they do more than simple format extension swaps. However, if you just need a basic converter, NCH software offers a free version of its <a href=\"https://www.nchsoftware.com/prism/\">Prism Video Converter</a> software. It’s about as simple as it gets –you load the files you want to convert, select an output format and hit convert. When we tested it, we were able to start converting files immediately after downloading the software, which took one minute.","It supports all the popular formats you need and can even optimize videos for playback on iOS and Android devices. The program also includes a basic array of encoder and video options as well as some very simple effects. So, it has a few extras but nothing compared to some of the paid programs we reviewed. If you want a program that can edit video and download online videos, you need to pay for it.","<strong><br/>More Guides for Converting Files:</strong>"]},"id":"791a96d7-ef92-469c-819e-82cc4866d106","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-audio-editing-software\">The Best Audio Editing Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-audio-converter-software\">The Best Audio Converter Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-video-converter-software\">The Best Video Converter Software for PC</a>","<a href=\"/best-video-editing-software\">The Best Inexpensive Video Editing Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-professional-video-editing-software\">The Best Professional Video Editing Software</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"1271d5b2-b258-4336-a04c-152a005e9cfd","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_120","url":"/best-mac-video-converter","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
