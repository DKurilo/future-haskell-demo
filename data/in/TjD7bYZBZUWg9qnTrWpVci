You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The attractive and professional-looking Waring SB30 electric <a href=\"/best-hot-plates\">hot plate</a> uses a circular iron plate to heat pots and pans of food. Unlike an induction hot plate, which creates heat in the pan itself, the Waring hot plate heats up on a circular cooktop area that, in turn, heats the pot or pan you are using to prepare food.","This electric hot plate features brushed stainless steel and a black trim. The unit has a power indicator light that tells you that the electrical power is on. It also has a useful &#34;ready&#34; light that lets you know when the cooking surface area gets to the correct heating level to cook the food you want to prepare. You get five power settings with this hot plate for cooking: low, low/medium, medium, medium/high and high. One drawback is that this cooktop takes a bit of time to cool down.","Our kitchen testing produced mixed results. When trying to heat up water, it took the Waring SB30 10:33 minutes to bring the water to a rolling boil. This is the second longest time it took for water to boil out of the products we tested. Therefore, you can cook food that needs to be boiled, like pasta, but you will have to be patient.","When it came to melting chocolate over lower heat, the Waring performed well. It took 17:09 minutes, which is a good time, since slow melting times are essential for delicate foods such as chocolate. The result was smooth, lump-free and delicious liquid chocolate.","We got good but not outstanding results when making crepes. We used a pan sprayed with nonstick spray and traditional crepe batter. The crepe was thoroughly cooked, which indicates even heating by the Waring, and it was reasonably well browned and tasted great.","This hot plate measures 11.5 inches long, 10.75 inches wide, 3.5 inches high, and features a cooking area of 7.5 inches in diameter. Its cord is 36 inches long and it weighs 6.5 pounds. You get temperature ranges of 217-515 degrees Fahrenheit with this unit.","This electric hot plate offers some appealing, built-in safety features, including a three-pronged grounded electrical plug and non-skid rubber feet that reduce the risk of this appliance moving around a countertop. You also get an auto shut-off feature."]},"id":"f6fbb180-4491-4660-ad6c-0d9b095ccec6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"681dd178-2571-48aa-b4ec-e6d995db76c2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Waring SB30 performed nicely when we did lower temperature cooking tests, but it was a bit disappointing that it took so long to bring water to a boil.
