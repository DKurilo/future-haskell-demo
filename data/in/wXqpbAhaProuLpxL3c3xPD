Furthermore, they all contain wide, beautiful screens with HD resolution. Many of the devices we reviewed even have touch screens, giving the computers the tablet feel that&#39;s starting to pop up on many devices.","<strong>Performance</strong><br/>High speeds and lots of memory are the name of the game in this category.
