The first motor is designed to move the shaver side-to-side, while the second motor moves the shaving head up and down. The motor spins at 14,000 cuts per minute, which helps ensures you cover all areas of your face and head. The battery only lasts for 45 minutes on a single charge, which is one of the shortest times we&#39;ve seen.
