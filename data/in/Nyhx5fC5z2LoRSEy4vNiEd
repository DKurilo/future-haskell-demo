However, this browser doesn’t work on Windows computers. Safari isn’t as customizable as browsers like <a href=\"/mozilla-firefox-review\">Firefox</a> and <a href=\"/google-chrome-review\">Chrome</a>. Still, it is fast and easy to use, and it syncs your browser settings across all your Apple devices – your tagged sites, passwords and browser history are accessible on all your Mac computers, tablets and smartphones.","This web browser took under a second to start up and an average of 3.4 seconds to navigate to and load pages, including content-heavy ones like CNN.com. Compared to most browsers, this is very fast. <br/>While Safari is an Apple-compatible web browser, it can access sites such as Google and Microsoft as well as online applications made by these companies, including Outlook and Google Docs. During testing, we accessed and edited in Google Docs and sent emails without encountering compatibility issues.","Safari’s Reading List and Top Sites are a couple of our favorite features. Top Sites is the browser’s version of bookmarks, and it shows an at-a-glance preview of saved websites so you don’t have to click through to the page to see new content. This is similar to an RSS feed, but it allows you to preview a site in full rather than simply see a list of new content. Reading List is a way to save the URLs of internet articles you want to revisit or read later. When you click Safari’s Reader button on the right side of the search bar, it cuts out all the advertisements and visual distractions in an article so you can focus on reading the content.","Safari also has tabs, spell check and a password manager. However, it lags behind the competition because it isn’t very customizable. You can’t pin shortcuts or hide features like you can in other browsers, and you can’t choose a unique theme or background to personalize how Safari looks.","During our in-house tests, we were impressed by Safari’s ability to recognize and warn us about phishing schemes and dangerous websites that are known to harbor malware threats. It even recognized some Windows threats and blocked us from accessing them. Safari also lets you delete private data such as your browsing history, and it has a privacy mode that doesn’t track the sites you look at.","Safari has the best customer service options of the web browsers we reviewed. It is one of the few that offers telephone support and email support. You can also view user forums, online user guides, tutorials and FAQs on its website.","Safari has most of the basic features the best browsers include such as tabbed browsing and a password manager. It is also quite secure and very fast. However, it isn’t very customizable and can’t be used on Windows computers. But, if you’re looking for a no-frills browser for you Mac, iPad, iPhone, or Android phone or tablet, Safari is a solid option."]},"id":"1e89b4cf-8c75-4584-8d6f-09a674b02027","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_543","url":"/safari-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-13T00:00:00Z","name":"Safari","synopsis":"Safari is Apple’s internet browser, and it’s compatible with Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, and Android phones and tablets.","review":{"rating":77,"verdict":"Safari is the best browser for Mac computers and iOS mobile devices.","pros":["Safari&#8217;s launch and page load times are impressive."],"cons":["It isn&#8217;t as customizable as other web browsers."]},"strapline":"Safari is Apple’s internet browser, and it’s compatible with Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, and Android phones and tablets.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-13T00:00:00Z","id":"Nyhx5fC5z2LoRSEy4vNiEd","meta":{"title":"Safari Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Safari is the official Mac web browser, and it syncs across your Apple devices.
