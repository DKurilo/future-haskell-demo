The bad news is charge time – it takes over an hour to charge up a depleted battery, and the charger only works with car cigarette lighters. If you want to charge up a spare battery without keeping your car running, we recommend buying an inverter that converts the car charger to a regular two-pronged plug."]},"id":"f8b66c97-38d9-4f66-a345-1cca60e339a6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Flight Features"},"id":"98977936-5ad7-424b-a959-7c18535dae0f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/6zzif3EsWm7winNGTW7FVo.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/60370-hobbyzone-delta-ray5.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zzif3EsWm7winNGTW7FVo.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"6zzif3EsWm7winNGTW7FVo","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zzif3EsWm7winNGTW7FVo.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c62d095f-872c-4b77-b004-7d016ed3b38c","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As long as your Delta Ray is in the air, you’re in for a wild ride. With sweeping loops, tight barrel rolls and one of the best panic button recovery times we saw during testing, it might lack a rudder and elevator, but this RC airplane kit is still extremely capable. Between its differential thrust motors and wing-spanning ailerons, it has plenty of maneuverability.","Of course, all that maneuverability and aforementioned speed has a downside: If you crash, you crash hard. We gave the Delta Ray to a new pilot who didn’t know the panic button was there, and he promptly smashed the plane into concrete. As photos we took of the results can attest, the damage was almost catastrophic.","When you’re just starting out with the Delta Ray, be sure to keep your left index finger poised on the panic button, and don’t be afraid to use it. The Delta Ray’s panic mode can get you out of any hazardous situation, so long as you press it in time and have enough height off the ground. You can even use the panic button when it comes time to land; just squeeze it, throttle down and let the aircraft glide to the ground."]},"id":"d7566e84-d253-4133-8db6-f692b20d23c5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Transmitter"},"id":"8d531ec0-7cfa-49e5-a41e-6ea0d7ace998","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/Zq8MSJvTLzBTSSMBp7dKZR.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/60370-hobbyzone-delta-ray6.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zq8MSJvTLzBTSSMBp7dKZR.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Zq8MSJvTLzBTSSMBp7dKZR","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zq8MSJvTLzBTSSMBp7dKZR.jpg","alt":""},"id":"837ad7da-2176-4e16-8b28-0e93fc59a89a","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Spektrum’s DX line of radio transmitters are the de facto gold standard in radio control, so it was pleasing to learn that the Delta Ray comes with a DX4e four-channel remote. Most of the remote control airplanes we reviewed use various E-flite transmitters. They’re capable and do the job, but they can’t match the Spektrum’s range, which tops out at 900 feet – almost three times what the competition boasts. Given the Delta Ray’s speed, that range is welcome, but it also necessitates a warning: Unless you find a very large treeless field, you can easily lose track of your plane behind foliage.
