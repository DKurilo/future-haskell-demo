We have contacted manufacturers with numerous questions to clarify issues and discover unique features. We also consulted with professionals and industry insiders to increase our expertise and get informed opinions about the best tubs out there. ","<strong>How We Researched Hot Tubs</strong>","The first task in researching hot tubs was finding some of the best inflatable hot tubs on the market, through in-depth online research. We found a lineup of tubs we felt best served our readers and then compared them to discover which was the best overall and which tubs would be best for families. After extensive research we were able to write about them in a way that will help you find the tub that works best for you. ","<strong>How Much Does It Cost to Run an Inflatable Hot Tub?</strong>","The cost of running an inflatable hot tub depends on a few major factors: electricity, water, filters, cleaning and chemicals. To a lesser degree, other factors will contribute to hot tub maintenance costs, like its size, where you set it up, how often you use it and how strict you are about cleaning it. Electricity costs vary by state, so running a hot tub may be less expensive in Louisiana residents than in Alaska or Hawaii.","<br/>In our research, we found that the average cost of running an inflatable hot tub is $600 per year. If you purchase a larger hot tub and use it more often than three times a week, you’ll see a higher electricity bill among other costs.","<strong>What to Look for in Inflatable Hot Tubs</strong>","The design of an inflatable hot tub is simple. It consists of an inflatable tub made of PVC or vinyl, as well as an external combination pump and heater unit that controls both water temperature and jets. Inflatable hot tubs can generally be set up in 15 or 20 minutes and filled from a garden hose. Most of them can heat water up to comfortably hot temperatures overnight. Even though the basics are the same across the models listed here, there are some key factors to consider in your buying decision.","Construction<br/>Layered vinyl or PVC is standard for inflatable hot tubs, but many models reinforce the walls of the tub with fabrics like polyester or nylon. This is usually indicated with a proprietary name; Intex calls its unique blend of materials Fiber-Tech, while Coleman uses the name Tri Tech 3 Layer Material for its mix of polyester mesh and layered PVC.","The design and structure of the tub is just as important as the materials used to make it. Many manufacturers use a segmented inflatable design, reinforced with a vertical I-beam structure inside. These internal vinyl panels make for a sturdier tub, one that can support users leaning against it or even sitting directly on the outer wall of the spa. Premium portable hot tubs add another level of stability and protection with interlocking panels that surround the inflatable tub. Made of waterproof composite materials, these panels provide a rigid wall that protects and insulates the hot tub.","Covers<br/>All inflatable spas include a locking top cover for safety reasons. Some, however, also use the cover to insulate the tub and speed up the heating process. Some models include inflatable covers that fit into the top of the tub like a stopper in a bottle, while others use insulating materials like foam or foil lining to keep the heat inside. Regardless of insulation style, you’ll want a cover that’s more than a fitted piece of fabric.","Accessories<br/>There are all sorts of accessories available for maintaining your portable spa and enhancing the experience, from chemical dispensers to inflatable seat cushions. Any hot tub you consider should include the basic filter cartridges necessary for use, if not an extra filter or two. If you plan to leave the tub filled for days or weeks at a time, you’ll also want one that includes chemicals like chlorine or bromine, along with the necessary dispenser and test strips to monitor the pH levels of the water. Other accessory manufacturers offer a ground mat to protect the bottom of the tub, built-in water softening, and built-in or attachable seat cushions and cup holders.","With proper care and maintenance, an inflatable hot tub can last for months or even years. An inflatable spa is also much more affordable than a traditional in-ground hot tub or above-ground spa. Inflatable models cost thousands of dollars less while still giving you all the bubbles, jets and warmth you want.","<strong>Maintenance Tips</strong>","With regular maintenance, you can keep your inflatable hot tub running optimally all year round and use it whenever you want. Inflatable hot tubs also require a cadre of accessories, tools and cleaning equipment to maintain. But if you invest in quality equipment and regularly clean your hot tub, it will last longer and develop fewer problems during its lifetime.","Empty &amp; Clean It. Cleaning instructions vary slightly from hot tub to hot tub. However, most need to be drained and physically cleaned on a fairly regular basis. This process isn’t too difficult, luckily – a sponge and some mild dish soap should do the trick. Let the tub fully air dry after rinsing before filling it back up.","Test pH Levels. It’s critical that you regularly test the alkalinity of the water in your hot tub. The pH may change very little when you’re not using the tub and more sharply during times of frequent use, especially if more than one or two people use it. If the pH levels drop too low, the hot tub’s interior materials, or even the entire tub, could deteriorate.","Keep It Covered. When there’s water in your hot tub and you’re not using it, keep it covered. This serves two purposes. First, it keeps out leaves, debris and animals so your inflatable hot tub stays clean. Second, the lid helps hold in heat. Although a cover won’t maintain the water at a temperature comfortable for soaking, keeping it as warm as possible shortens the time it takes to heat it up when you want to use it.","Change Filters. Just as you would with a standard pool, you should change your inflatable hot tub’s filter once a week or so to keep it clean and debris-free. Most models have a filter you can clean and reuse, though you may want to replace it if it’s old. Consult the user manual that came with your hot tub for filter replacement recommendations.","Add a Sanitizing Solution. This should seem obvious, but it bears emphasis. In addition to regularly draining and cleaning your hot tub and changing its filters, you should also sanitize it. You can add in a sanitizer before each use or on a less frequent yet regular basis if you don’t use it often."]},"id":"bbca81aa-2739-4744-bb18-62231e8a81f7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_228","url":"/best-inflatable-hot-tubs","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-29T22:11:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-29T22:11:00Z","name":"Best Inflatable Hot Tubs of 2019","synopsis":"An inflatable hot tub is made of PVC or vinyl and has combination pump and heater unit that controls both water temperature and jets.","review":{},"strapline":"An inflatable hot tub is made of PVC or vinyl and has combination pump and heater unit that controls both water temperature and jets.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-29T17:57:58Z","id":"FZZEd3afdSpp2UyHgnmqDg","meta":{"title":"Best Inflatable Hot Tubs of 2019 - Portable Spa Reviews and Guide","description":"An inflatable hot tub is made of PVC or vinyl and has combination pump and heater unit that controls both water temperature and jets.\t"},"products":[{"slug":"coleman-lay-z-spa-54131e","url":"/product/coleman-lay-z-spa-54131e","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","name":"Coleman Lay-Z-Spa 54131E","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","id":"f8T5XWoDX9PMcDwQV9mpt4","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"intex-77-purespa-bubble-28403e","url":"/product/intex-77-purespa-bubble-28403e","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","name":"Intex 77 PureSpa Bubble 28403E","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","id":"C2ZJxqcrtnB28zRoRZJgLY","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"mspa-alpine-m-009ls","url":"/product/mspa-alpine-m-009ls","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","name":"MSpa Alpine M-009LS","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","id":"EetZUyvyJMKvpKdf6akNZT","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"soho-4-person-jet-bubble-spa","url":"/product/soho-4-person-jet-bubble-spa","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","name":"Soho 4 Person Jet Bubble Spa","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","id":"iTmzahk744iEJ8NCPjrAQ7","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"saluspa-realtree-max-5","url":"/product/saluspa-realtree-max-5","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","name":"SaluSpa Realtree MAX-5","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","id":"9hAtqTmYb4QHsbYnkSaSsZ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/zytQShrdd2Lt5aUwSYoS4C.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","mimeType":"","name":"HERO-Inflatable-Hot-Tubs.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/A/W/746888/original/HERO-Inflatable-Hot-Tubs.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","id":"zytQShrdd2Lt5aUwSYoS4C","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zytQShrdd2Lt5aUwSYoS4C.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Inflatable Hot Tubs of 2019","description":"An inflatable hot tub is made of PVC or vinyl and has combination pump and heater unit that controls both water temperature and jets.\t"},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/zytQShrdd2Lt5aUwSYoS4C.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","mimeType":"","name":"HERO-Inflatable-Hot-Tubs.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/A/W/746888/original/HERO-Inflatable-Hot-Tubs.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","id":"zytQShrdd2Lt5aUwSYoS4C","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zytQShrdd2Lt5aUwSYoS4C.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Inflatable Hot Tubs of 2019","description":"An inflatable hot tub is made of PVC or vinyl and has combination pump and heater unit that controls both water temperature and jets.\t"}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"pool-and-hot-tub","url":"/home-and-garden/pool-and-hot-tub","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","name":"Pool & Hot Tub","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:38Z","id":"Snsyvysc6JMsPB5BLBFHBh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
