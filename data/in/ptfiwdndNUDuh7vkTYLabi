Living up to Milwaukee&#39;s strong reputation, this saw is built with durability and longevity in mind. It is easily one of the best corded circular saws for both professionals and home users.","This circular saw uses 7 1/4-inch blades, and the motor turns them at a speed of up to 5800 rpm. Its 3.25 horsepower translates to smooth, easy cuts through a variety of materials. In addition, this 10.4-pound saw is compact. Although it isn&#39;t the lightest model we reviewed, which is the <a href=\"/craftsman-review\">Craftsman 3284</a>, it is light enough to be easy to maneuver and handle.","At 10.4 pounds, this tool falls right in the middle ground of the models we tested. The heaviest was 12 pounds and the lightest is 8.6 pounds. This might not seem like much of a difference, but you’ll notice when you’ve been using it for an extended period of time.","As with most sidewinder circular saws, the Milwaukee 6390-21&#39;s blade is located on the right-hand side of the handle – a design choice that sacrifices some of the blade’s visibility as you cut to better balance the tool and make it comfortable to handle. This circular saw also uses a patented adjustable and ergonomic handle design called Tilt-Lok, which allows you to quickly adjust the grip. This is a welcome feature since it lets you adjust the handle to the most comfortable position for you.","This saw is good at dust removal, but not as good as tools like the <a href=\"/dewalt-dwe575sb-review\">DeWALT DWE575SB</a> and the <a href=\"/skil-review\">SKIL 5280-01</a>. You can expect some dust getting in the way of your work, however, you will have to take some extra time cleaning it off when you’re done.","While the Milwaukee 6390-21 is one of the best power saws, it’s missing features other models we reviewed have. For example, this saw does not include a laser guide to help you cut straight lines or an electric brake to slow or stop the blade as soon as you release the trigger.","The saw’s most noticeable exclusion is bevel stops, which help you quickly adjust the tool to make bevel cuts at common angles. This drastically reduces the usefulness of this tool, especially when compared to tools like the <a href=\"/makita-5007mga-magnesium-review\">Makita 5007MGA</a> and <a href=\"/ridgid-r3205-review\">RIDGID R3205</a>. Both of which will save you time and increase accuracy when making frequent-used cutting angles.","This saw comes with a convenient hard carrying case to protect it during transport and storage. It’s one of only two saws we reviewed to include a hard case. Others only had a soft case, which doesn’t provide as good of protection. The rest omit a case altogether, leaving you to put out extra cash if you want one.","Milwaukee includes an impressive five-year warranty that protects your purchase against manufacturer defects. You can also view an online version of the user manual on the company&#39;s website or contact customer service representatives by email or phone for direct assistance.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Milwaukee 6390-21 is one of the best circular saws for carpenters and homeowners alike, thanks to its versatile and powerful design. Though it’s missing some useful features, tools made by Milwaukee tend to have long lives because they are well built."]},"id":"4aad07a2-a323-410a-8c6d-6dbe947e61fc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64433","url":"/milwaukee-6390-21-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
