You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Skullcandy has been around since 2003 and certainly does not target audiophiles or even the casual music lover. No, Skullcandy goes after a very specific <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">stereo headphone</a> crowd as indicated by their company overview:","“Skullcandy makes the SICKEST headphones on the planet for Snow, Ski, Skate, Surf, Wake, Bike and Music. “","In addition to the best audio headphones for outdoor use, Skullcandy makes accessories for MP3 devices and cell phones, music backpacks and “dope apparel” – meaning apparel that is really cool and not something you would wear to take illegal drugs. In other words, Skullcandy is probably not making stereo headphones for your dad.","Skullcandy makes a variety of over-the-ear and ear bud stereo headphones. Here we review the <strong>Skullcandy Skullcrushers</strong> DJ headphones. While these stereo headphones are designed with DJs in mind, they can also be used at home and on the go.","Skullcrushers are loud. When we say loud, we are not necessarily talking about the sound, although these stereo headphones can handle high volumes without distortion. Instead, we are talking about the colorful and funky designs. These stereo headphones are available in several designs from the Skullcandy website: Black/White, Black Pinstripe, Peace Love Noise, Abel High Card, CMYK, Snoop Dogg Blue and Snoop Dogg Black.","Because Skullcandy does not target high-end audio users you might not expect them to best performing headphones in their class, but you would be wrong. We were pleasantly surprised by the above average sound quality and the excellent clarity. The balance among the high, middle and low frequencies is very nice and is suitable for a variety of music, especially rock and rap.","Skullcrushers are marketed as DJ headphones and they emphasize bass because that is what the kids want. These stereo headphones boost the bass with a volume-controlled mini-subwoofer with a 100 Hz vibration unit. The vibration unit can be controlled with an in-line volume control and on/off switch. Controlling the subwoofer requires one AA battery, which just happens to be included.","These DJ headphones have a documented frequency response of 20 Hz to 20 kHz, which means that these headphones can’t reproduce any tones outside your normal hearing range. These headphones have plenty of bass to rattle your brain when the subwoofer is turned on, but we found that when we turned it off the bass was fairly weak and undefined. The mid-range frequencies come through rather nicely with clarity in vocals and acoustic instruments. The high frequencies tend to overpower the mix as you turn up the volume and can even mask out some of the mid-range detail.","The headband fits tightly across the head to hold the ear cups in place and to provide a small measure of noise cancellation. However, the headphones can start to irritate your ears after extended use. The ear cups also pivot so you can easily monitor the sound in one ear as you DJ your next party.","The Skullcrushers come with a handy carrying case, a 5-foot cable with in-line volume control and a 1/8-inch gold-plated connector designed for use with portable devices. Also included is an extension cable and a quarter-inch gold-plated adapter plug. The headphones can be folded for compact storage and easy transport."]},"id":"5d4ba3c2-3ece-4f18-8b00-32b76063ac56","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d4f36e27-3865-48c7-be6c-d4fc1552c706","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you don’t mind being seen in public wearing full-size, brightly colored stereo headphones, the <strong>Skullcandy Skullcrushers</strong> DJ headphones just might be for you.
