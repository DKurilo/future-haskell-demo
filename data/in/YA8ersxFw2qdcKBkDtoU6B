When it comes to ease of use, features and overall performance, this dryer is one of the best in its price range. It is also an affordable dryer. The effectiveness of this dryer is evidenced by the number of rave customer reviews on sites all over the web.","It has 12 cycles including some specialty cycles. It includes, among others, Bulky, Delicates, Permanent Press, Anti-Bacterial, Wrinkle Free and a SteamFresh cycle. The fast cycles on this dryer are very effective and perform well overall. The SteamFresh cycle releases steam at the end of the cycle to reduce wrinkling. This is a feature common among high-end dryers, but much less common among midrange machines.","It’s a relatively compact dryer that will fit nicely in a variety of settings, and given its compact size, it is still a large-capacity clothes dryer. With a drum measuring 7.3 cubic feet, it will handle most any load you throw at it.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"e58aadc1-ef8f-4dd8-9e59-39b7c4939ffb","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At relatively low temperatures it will dry your delicates and bulky items in a reasonable timeframe. It may not dry quite as quickly as the manual claims, especially in Normal cycle mode, but it still dries effectively and even bulky loads won’t take much more than an hour.","This dryer uses an innovative design to achieve energy efficiency. The drum’s aluminized alloy steel surface reflects heat with extreme efficiency so the dryer uses less energy, which should translate into smaller utility bills.","You wouldn’t expect smart technology for a dryer in this price range, and while this dryer doesn’t offer the full package of smart features you will find in the high-end LG dryers, this dryer can perform a Smart Diagnosis. This enables your dryer to communicate with customer service through your smartphone. If there is, for instance, a part that needs replacing, the technician will be notified remotely what he needs to bring, so only one trip is needed. LG also offers a helpful chat service to answer questions you may have."]},"id":"a762a153-491e-42af-9b9a-0802b4c32f21","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"78ff4659-eb24-4626-a9b5-7fcd6c8e47c3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG DLEY1201V is one of the best midrange dryers on the market.
