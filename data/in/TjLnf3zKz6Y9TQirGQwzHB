It&#39;s Bluetooth-enabled and has a large 7-inch screen. It does not feature the cutting-edge smartphone integration of some of the other best in-dash navigation units. Other units have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which allow you to actually interact with smartphone apps via an in-dash unit&#39;s touchscreen. The W957HD allows some communication between your smartphone and the unit through Bluetooth and HDMI, but the integration is not at the holistic level of some of its competitors.","You can use an HDMI cable to mirror your smartphone&#39;s display on this in-dash unit&#39;s screen. You can see whatever is on your smartphone on your dash, but you&#39;ll have to use your smartphone to interact with your apps.","The best way you can integrate your smartphone and the W957HD is through Bluetooth. Bluetooth allows you to make and receive calls from your phone through the head unit. You can also control the music on your phone using the head unit&#39;s touchscreen.","It also has a satellite radio antenna, so you can receive music signals from SiriusXM satellite radio if you buy the subscription. It also has an HD receiver, so you can pick up the HD signal transmitted by many FM stations. HD radio does not require a subscription. Like all the aftermarket navigation systems we reviewed, the W957HD can play CDs and DVDs.","The W957HD excels at navigation and traffic. It comes with free maps of the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, so you don&#39;t have to use your smartphone data to navigate. It also comes with a free lifetime traffic subscription and a built-in traffic receiver.","One of the biggest weaknesses of this GPS is that it has a resistive touchscreen, not capacitive, so it is significantly less responsive than a smartphone touchscreen.","Alpine offers a one-year warranty on the Alpine W957HD. The company has phone and social media support; however, it doesn&#39;t offer email support, unlike some of its competitors."]},"id":"e101ec14-9525-4678-8443-c19ae0128acd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d33a5f94-65ca-4846-8ca4-322b101e6816","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Alpine W957HD is an above-average in-dash navigation system.
