Virtual desktops allow you to set up all your programs, apps, and servers on an external server and then access everything wirelessly. Virtualization software, including <a href=\"/money/small-business\">VMWare</a>, <a href=\"/money/small-business\">Cisco</a> and <a href=\"/money/small-business\">Citrix</a>, allow you to set up everything you or your employees need for your business. DAAS programs offer a variety of different services, with some including virtual servers, collaboration tools and productivity management.","<strong>DAAS: What to Look For</strong>","While any DAAS offers basic services, including a virtual desktop and some security, many offer additional features, such as better security, mobile access, compliance, scalable user bases and features like data sharing. The following features can help you choose a DAAS that&#39;s right for your business.","<strong>Security</strong><br/>Security is an important function for any DAAS, especially if you handle any credit card or payment data on your virtual desktop. Even if you mostly use your desktop for handling email, you still need security. Good security features to look for include encryption with secure connections as well as secure cloud storage. SEC/FINRA compliance regulates financial security and is important if you plan to use the virtual desktop for financial services.","<strong>Storage &amp; Memory</strong><br/>A virtual desktop has limited storage and memory, just like a real PC. While some DAAS companies offer unlimited storage or large amounts of storage, others offer limitations based on a pay scale so that you pay for what you need per computer. Memory is important because some programs require specific amounts of memory in order to run. Storage is also important if you want the virtual desktop to store many files. Some DAAS programs provide communal cloud storage, which eliminates the need for per-desktop storage.","<strong>Available OS</strong><br/>If you need a specific program or app, then it&#39;s important that you verify that the virtual desktop has an OS (operating system) compatible with your software. Many have a list of available choices you can select from while setting up your software while others allow you to switch as necessary. If you want to use the virtual desktop as a server, then it is important that you make sure a server is available.","<strong>Mobile Access</strong><br/>Mobile access may not be important for everyone, but it offers a lot in terms of convenience. Mobile access means that you can log into your virtual desktop from any device, including a phone or a tablet, so that you can reply to an e-mail, work on a document or work on projects even when you&#39;re not in the office.","<strong>Scalable Offerings</strong><br/>While some DAAS companies only offer virtual desktop software to large businesses, many offer fully scalable services for small business. If you choose a small-business option, it is important to ensure that you can scale up as needed, in case your business expands. Most DAAS offerings are scalable with payment options per user plan, which allows you to pick an option that suits the current size of your business.","Choosing a virtual desktop service affects what tasks you can perform, your employees and security. Knowing what you need allows you to choose the ideal DAAS for your business."]},"id":"c0bdd7aa-b773-4e9d-a9bf-e6b854703709","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"5ee9d04b-9362-4c0d-843b-2dd5cb72b831","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/\">Amazon WorkSpaces</a>","<a href=\"http://www.apps4rent.com/virtual-desktop-plans.html\">Apps4Rent</a>","<a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/data-center-virtualization/desktop-as-a-service-solution/index.html\">Cisco</a>","<a href=\"http://www.citrix.com/products/daas/overview.html\">Citrix</a>","<a href=\"http://www.computersupport.com/products-and-services/the-cloud/\">ComputerSupport ITAnyWhere</a>","<a href=\"https://shop.dincloud.com/catalog/products/2/\">dinCloud dinHVD</a>","<a href=\"http://www.leostream.com/daas/request-a-demo?__hssc=190218292.6.1440473674502&__hstc=190218292.fce04dca024602edd6d5eacae70bbb4f.1440473674502.1440473674502.1440473674502.1&hsCtaTracking=032d3b93-f70b-4690-bfbf-1b3e2874a3bd|f7ef007a-aca8-48e4-a9dc-d4b41a0f52f8\">Leostream</a>","<a href=\"http://www.solidfire.com/solutions/service-providers/desktop-as-a-service/\">SolidFire</a>","<a href=\"http://www.tucloud.com\">tuCloud DAAS</a>","<a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/cloud-services/desktop/horizon-air-desktop/compare.html\">VMware Horizon Air</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"660503ab-b7ea-4cf5-b173-0cc7f1bc9182","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1648","url":"/best-desktop-as-a-service","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-06T23:17:45Z","datePublished":"2015-09-01T21:50:21Z","name":"Desktop as a Service Review","synopsis":"DAAS allows you to use cloud and virtual desktops to access your servers, software and hardware.
