You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Remington Short Cut Clipper is one of the most versatile products on our lineup. It features self-sharpening blades and five different length settings, which gives you many different options. In addition to the different lengths and settings, it also features a balding comb that lets you cut nearly to the skin. This electric hair cutter also features a unique curved blade design, although this can hinder as well as help.","This <a href=\"/best-electric-head-shavers\">electric hair cutting device</a> is versatile when compared to some products on our lineup. The main function of this product is clippers. It can cut your hair to five different lengths. It features self-sharpening blades, so you do not need to worry about frequently replacing them. During our testing, we found the curved design made it difficult to reach certain areas of the head.","If you desire a close-cut appearance, a balding comb is included with this product that allows you to cut hair quite short. However, when we tested this product, we found it was better at making a low trim instead of a smooth shave. In addition, you can easily trim facial hair with this product, though it will not cut wet hair.","The Remington Short Cut Clipper is a cordless device. It provides up to 40 minutes of run time on a single battery charge but takes several hours to recharge. We are disappointed in the battery life of this device. The run time is one of the shortest in our comparison, and the charge time is among the longest.","You can easily clean this device by rinsing it under tap water. However, you should be cautious not to completely submerge it. The shaver also comes with cleaning oil and a brush for long-term maintenance.","This Remington product is covered under a two-year warranty. This is the average warranty length for head shavers."]},"id":"d78cdc83-152f-4ec9-912d-c86a21f7b683","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"185cb4ff-f7ed-4e39-b01f-0c951925eeaf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Remington Short Cut Clipper is a versatile hair cutting product.
