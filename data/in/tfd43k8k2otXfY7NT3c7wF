You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Exerpeutic Gold 575 XLS is an <a href=\"/best-exercise-bikes\">upright exercise bike</a> with a lightweight yet durable steel frame. Featuring 21 workout presets and 16 levels of resistance, it is the best folding exercise bike we reviewed and has an MSRP of $249. The <a href=\"/xterra-fitness-fb350-review\">XTERRA Fitness FB350</a> also folds, and it’s our best value pick. However, the Exerpeutic has several advantages, including higher performance and more versatility. It also costs more. The XTERRA is priced below $150.","The Exerpeutic has the highest maximum user weight of all the exercise bikes we compared, accommodating users weighing up to 400 pounds. At 225 pounds, the weight limit on the XTERRA bike is the lightest. Weight capacity is important because a heavier weight limit makes a bike more stable. On the flip side, if you exceed the maximum, you could jeopardize your safety.","The Gold 575 XLS has an adjustable seat, pedal straps and an accessory holder. Its user height range is 5’1” to 6’5”. Although its handles aren’t adjustable, they do come with integrated pulse grip sensors to help you monitor your heart rate. If you’re looking for a bike that also has a wireless chest strap, consider the <a href=\"/nautilus-u618-review\">Nautilus U618</a>, which is our top pick in exercise bikes. Our favorite recumbent bike, the <a href=\"/schwinn-270-recumbent-review\">Schwinn 270 Recumbent</a>, is telemetry enabled, but you must buy a compatible chest strap separately.","This exercise bike’s console has a backlit LCD display that provides detailed workout feedback. It can store two user profiles, and it has a device holder for your smartphone or tablet. Its console computer features Bluetooth Smart technology that is compatible with the iOS system. You can sync the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paradigm.myfitquest4&amp;hl=en_US\">MyFitQuest 4</a> app to track your fitness goals.","Unlike the best exercise bikes on the market, the Exerpeutic Gold 575 XLS doesn’t have a workout fan, speakers or an aux port. If these features are important to you, exercise bikes such as the U618, <a href=\"/proform-review\">ProForm 8.0 EX</a> and <a href=\"/nordictrack-gx-4.4-pro-review\">NordicTrack G 4.4 Pro</a> have them all. The <a href=\"/diamondback-fitness-review\">Diamondback Fitness 510Ub Upright</a> has them too, but it’s not Bluetooth connected.","Exerpeutic is a <a href=\"https://www.paradigmhw.com/\">Paradigm Health &amp; Wellness</a> brand. The Gold 575 XLS has assembled dimensions of 39 x 26.4 x 48.4 inches (length, width, height) and folds to 26.4 x 24.8 x 57.5 inches. Weighing just 51.6 pounds, it’s one of the lightest exercise bikes in our top 10. Its warranty is also lightweight. Considering that the ProForm and NordicTrack bikes have lifetime frame warranties, the Exerpeutic’s one-year warranty is disappointing.","Consumers say this bike is easy to assemble, sturdy and stable. They also say it runs quietly and is comfortable to ride. However, wiring problems have been reported with the console, and one consumer said, “If you are short, this bike may be a bit of a stretch.”","Although it took us a while to make the Exerpeutic/Paradigm connection, we eventually figured it out. The company provides consumer support by phone, email and live chat."]},"id":"ff8897f3-1874-4002-95e6-66245d9ab1f1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70189","url":"/exerpeutic-gold-575-xls-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-08-29T16:20:42Z","datePublished":"2018-08-29T16:20:42Z","name":"Exerpeutic Gold 575 XLS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":83,"verdict":"The Exerpeutic Gold 575 XLS is an affordable upright exercise bike with Bluetooth Smart technology and an adjustable seat.
