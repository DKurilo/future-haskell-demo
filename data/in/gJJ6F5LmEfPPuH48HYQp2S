might seem a little intimidating at first. With its rich and vast quantity of words to learn, this vocabulary software is a lot to take in. This updated version of what once was Ultimate Vocabulary provides a whopping 142,647 vocabulary words and 649 word lists.","Since this <a href=\"/best-vocabulary-software\">vocabulary software</a> focuses heavily on using new words in context, it employs a database of 520 million words in various contexts so you can see the vocabulary words you are studying used in different ways and different contexts.","In addition, you can plug in your own words and word lists if there are specific things you want to study. This application also permits you to join online study groups and share words.","Although it might seem massive, this vocabulary building application lets you learn at your own pace and customize your approach to learning new words. No matter what learning style is best for you, Vocab1 has you covered with an abundance of vocabulary activities.Unlike <a href=\"/verbal-advantage-review\">Verbal Advantage</a>, another vocabulary learning program that uses audio recordings of words and definitions, Vocab1 has flash cards, word matching, sentence completion, games, tests, which are all included with the software. You select which process you&#39;d like to use, and you can jump to another section at any time.","One of the most impressive aspects of Vocab1 is that it works for any age group. The program also includes word lists for the GRE, SAT, TOEFL, Most Common English Words, English Conversation Words, Grades 1-10 and the GMAT.","When you encounter a new word in Vocab1, you will find a full definition, the origin of the word, synonyms, antonyms and more. This application will tell you if a word is a verb, noun, adjective or adverb, and it gives phonetic pronunciations for each word. This kind of detail is essential in helping a word and its meaning stick in your memory.","Some of the games are designed to help you learn how to spell the word, and the fill-in-the-blank exercises will help you learn how to use these words in a sentence. The definition of each word also includes the word in a sentence, which helps you see how to use the word.","If you have any problems with the software, you can contact customer support by phone or email. The company also has a 12-month money-back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the application.","Vocab1 works well for students studying for tests, adults looking to improve their comprehension and those who are learning the English language. The software lets you study the level of words you want to study, at the pace you set. Itâ€™s flexibility, thoroughness and enormous vocabulary library make it a great choice to improve your vocabulary."]},"id":"11465c08-c1a6-4304-8d37-0ec673da5491","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69056","url":"/vocab1-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"aaron-mccarter","url":"/author/aaron-mccarter","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Aaron McCarter","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EMPGWr9T6iJCifmMZAJCYY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-02-08T15:46:12Z","datePublished":"2017-02-08T15:46:12Z","name":"Vocab1","synopsis":"Vocab1 might seem a little intimidating at first.
