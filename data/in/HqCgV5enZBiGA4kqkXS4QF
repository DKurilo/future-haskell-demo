However, that lower-than-average airflow may be worth it if you live in a humid climate – this LG unit removes more moisture from the air than any other wall-mounted air conditioner we considered. It is also among the more affordable units, though none of them are cheap, and is suitable for a good-size room of up to 530 square feet.","While this wall-mounted AC unit is Energy Star qualified, it is not AHAM certified or UL listed, so LG’s claims about its energy efficiency and adherence to public safety standards aren’t verified by third-party laboratories. It does use chlorine-free refrigerant, which is better for the environment than coolant that contains chlorine. At 82 pounds, this unit is relatively heavy, even though it is a pretty average size.","The LG LT1236CER comes with a remote so you can operate it from across the room. However, it is missing a couple key convenience features. For example, it doesn’t have a sleep mode or an auto mode, so you need to adjust it and turn it on and off manually. You can program the unit to start or stop at set times using the programmable timer. It also has an energy-saver mode, which can save you money on your electric bill, as well as three fan speeds.","One of this unit’s biggest drawbacks is the skimpy one-year compressor warranty that accompanies its standard one-year appliance warranty. Several of the AC units we reviewed, including the <a href=\"/friedrich-review\">Friedrich Uni-Fit US12D10C</a>, include five-year compressor warranties. If you have questions, you can search for answers in the FAQs on LG’s website or contact customer service by email or live chat.","The LG LT1236CER is a high-efficiency, in-wall AC with a somewhat low airflow and a below-average warranty. It’s also missing convenience features like a sleep mode and an auto mode.  However, the unit’s dehumidify mode makes it a good choice if you live in a humid climate – it removes more moisture from the air than any other wall-mounted air conditioner we reviewed. Also, even with its low airflow, the LT1236CER can cool a good-size room of 530 square feet, and it is one of the more affordable units we reviewed."]},"id":"154518ce-0f7e-4043-a0ac-3cfd9589931c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69289","url":"/lg-lt1236cer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-05T16:06:10Z","datePublished":"2017-05-05T16:06:10Z","name":"LG LT1236CER","synopsis":"The LG LT1236CER wall air conditioner has the lowest maximum airflow of the units we reviewed, just 265 cubic feet per minute.","review":{"rating":86,"verdict":"The LG LT1236CER is very energy efficient and extracts more moisture from the air than any other unit we reviewed.
