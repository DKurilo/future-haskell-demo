We tried to find a wide variety of machines since there are so many: canister, upright, hand-held, dual steam, home-use and commercial-grade. We looked for varying characteristics as well, such as steam cleaners that produce steam with on-board heaters as well as machines that simply use the hot water that you add.","Our research weighed the costs of the machines, and we tried to provide a range so you could find a steam vacuum that suits the kind of flooring you want to clean, as well as your bank account. ","<strong>How We Researched </strong>","To learn as much as possible about steam vacuums, we did extensive reading, watched numerous demo videos showing how to use the machines and their features, studied manufacturers’ websites and examined the fine print in warranties. We also compared the specifications of each model and noted the power of each motor, as measured in amps and volts, since that can make a huge difference in cleaning floors quickly.","In addition, we carefully read user reviews to see what people who bought and used these products liked or disliked about particular steam vacuums. We examined the tools and attachments that come with each machine, and documented the length of the electrical cord and the size of on-board water reservoirs for the clean water and detergent as well as the dirty water removed from the floor.","<strong>Things to Look for in a Steam Vacuum  </strong>","Design<br/>Because steam cleaner vacuums are so versatile, they come in various shapes and sizes. Some models have a lightweight, hand-held, dual-steam design; others are maneuverable uprights. You can opt to pull a canister along or push a heavy-duty carpet washer. Check for the cord length so you aren’t inconvenienced when it comes time to switch electrical outlets.","The water tank is another consideration. Models with smaller water tanks and an easy-fill design are best for quick cleanups and tidying around the house. Larger water containers allow you to refill less often and deep clean, but they will make the vacuum heavier.","Motor &amp; Suction Power<br/>It&#39;s important to check amps, volts and watts while steam-vacuum shopping. It&#39;s not always clearly listed, but when you find those specifications, remember higher is better. The watts reflect how much power the vacuum&#39;s motor has, which generally provides stronger suction.<br/><br/>Controls &amp; Attachments<br/>When you clean with steam, you want to make sure there&#39;s no standing water when you&#39;re done so that it&#39;s not soaking into your carpet or ruining your hardwood floors. Some steam vacuums come with a drying unit built into the steaming process or a vacuum switch to suck up the extra water. The best steam vacuums will have a trigger or other controls to manage the amount of steam they release.","id:1234"]},"id":"f5e1a88a-cce2-4fb9-b57b-496b41f0d2de","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_166","url":"/best-steam-vacuums","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-01-19T18:25:03Z","datePublished":"2018-01-19T18:25:03Z","name":"Best Steam Vacuums of 2018","synopsis":"Brooms, dustpans, buckets, mops and vacuums fill our closets, but many steam vacuums can handle the jobs of all those items.","review":{},"strapline":"Brooms, dustpans, buckets, mops and vacuums fill our closets, but many steam vacuums can handle the jobs of all those items.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-11-14T15:07:27Z","id":"pDuoJxZTF55gmXw3hBNsUP","meta":{"title":"Best Steam Vacuum Cleaners of 2018 - Vacuum and Steam Mop Combo","description":"Brooms, dustpans, buckets, mops and vacuums fill our closets, but many steam vacuums can handle the jobs of all those items."},"products":[{"slug":"vapor-clean-desiderio-auto","url":"/product/vapor-clean-desiderio-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","name":"Vapor Clean Desiderio Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","id":"9gJ2fZXHF7U9sbnLhszAVc","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"hoover-steamvac-carpet-washer","url":"/product/hoover-steamvac-carpet-washer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","name":"Hoover SteamVac Carpet Washer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","id":"YNj9YoGpqppHpD7vneAG7M","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"bissell-symphony-bagless-2-in-1-upright","url":"/product/bissell-symphony-bagless-2-in-1-upright","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","name":"Bissell Symphony Bagless 2-in-1 Upright","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","id":"6m83LY2AKwhWS7Xchbezj","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/BhsHh9yEugNHvmEgNfcig6.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Steam-Vacuums-001.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/E/O/743136/original/Hero-Steam-Vacuums-001.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","id":"BhsHh9yEugNHvmEgNfcig6","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BhsHh9yEugNHvmEgNfcig6.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Steam Vacuums of 2018","description":"Brooms, dustpans, buckets, mops and vacuums fill our closets, but many steam vacuums can handle the jobs of all those items."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/BhsHh9yEugNHvmEgNfcig6.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Steam-Vacuums-001.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/E/O/743136/original/Hero-Steam-Vacuums-001.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","id":"BhsHh9yEugNHvmEgNfcig6","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BhsHh9yEugNHvmEgNfcig6.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Steam Vacuums of 2018","description":"Brooms, dustpans, buckets, mops and vacuums fill our closets, but many steam vacuums can handle the jobs of all those items."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"vacuums","url":"/home-and-garden/vacuums","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","name":"Vacuums","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:43Z","id":"8ELcJaCVkXQm5iVYeKWzem","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
