The tools and features found in this software are impressive, but it’s missing some functionality that keeps it from being one of the <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-to-dvd-converter-software\">best </a><a href=\"/best-blu-ray-to-dvd-converter-software\">Blu-ray converter applications</a> available.","The method of conversion utilized by Blu-ray to DVD is identical to the rest of the Blu-ray rippers found on our side-by-side comparison chart. Simply insert the Blu-ray disc you want to convert, rip the content off the disc, convert it, and then burn it onto a recordable DVD. There is nothing new or innovative about this approach however it is very easy to understand and follow. You shouldn’t get too tripped up using the software.","Where this application falls down is in the fact that Blu-ray to DVD converter software has no native copy protection removal features. This means that in order to rip the content off of a commercial disc, you first must break the encryption yourself. This can be a difficult task for the uninitiated and although the application offers several resources to break that encryption, the fact that you must go outside the application to perform such a basic task defeats the purpose for which they bought it in the first place.","Once you’ve broken the encryption on your Blu-ray disc, the conversion process is quite fast and produces files that can be burned onto a DVD or played on a number of other devices. Blu-ray to DVD offers conversion profiles for generic videos that can be played on your computer as well as files that are specifically tailored for playback on smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles and more.","Blu-ray to DVD includes a native DVD burner tool. This helps make up for the lack of a native encryption-breaking tool. The burner is fast and accurate, and the quality of the end result is quite good. The only thing that indicated that our new DVD was a copy was the fact that it was contained on a recordable DVD."]},"id":"0e287484-8ba8-470a-a3dd-5f8605a9d358","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1020ce54-d75f-4c6c-b148-762e6d5748d2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At the end of the day, Blu-ray to DVD by VSO software is an adequate Blu-ray to DVD converter software solution.
