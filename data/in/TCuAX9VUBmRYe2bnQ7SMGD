I spent 40 hours researching extended car warranty plans, receiving quotes on multiple cars of varying mileage and age and read 130 pages of contracts. From all this, Autopom emerged as the service with the best quote process. Not only are there 21 plans, but the average price per mile covered makes it one of the most affordable. ","<strong>Quoting Process</strong>","Autopom received an A grade for the quoting process. Other services had faster and better quoting processes, but Autopom was still among the best services. Even though the sales representatives wanted to talk before providing a quote, they were happy to provide the quote in an email. This was a request most other services resisted. It may seem minor, but receiving an emailed quote shows this company has confidence in the value of its service and prices. And it should. In addition, in the follow-up, the sales representatives were never pushy or aggressive. In fact, the representatives were always very quick to respond to my questions.","From the quotes I received on several vehicles, the average price per mile covered was $0.01. By comparison, the average cost per mile was $0.04. The plans weren&#39;t necessarily the most affordable, but the mileage terms of the plans were often 100,000 miles or higher. For example, several other services quoted the same vehicles with similar prices but with mileage terms between 36,000 and 60,000 miles.","The one downside to the quote is the higher down payment. At an average of 10 percent, you pay more upfront than with other services. Most services are inconsistent on how they calculate the down payment, but the overall average was 5 percent of the total cost of a plan. So, for a plan quoted at about $3,000, most services require a $150 down payment while Autopom requires a $300 down payment. However, this does lower the monthly payments a bit.","<strong>Coverage Options</strong>","Autopom has 21 vehicle service contracts. Only <a href=\"/carshield-review\">Carshield</a> offers more. Many of the plans are only available in certain states and some aren&#39;t currently available for unclear reasons, but this service still sells more contracts than most vehicle service contract brokers. With a 225,000 mileage restriction and an age limit of 20 years, you have a great chance of receiving coverage for your car, even if it&#39;s old or used.","Autopom has four coverage options with between four and six contracts available in each coverage option. The exclusionary plans are the most comprehensive, covering so much of your car&#39;s components, the contract lists what isn&#39;t covered instead. These are the most expensive plans and are designed more for new cars. The high-level plans are a cost-effective alternative to the exclusionary plans. The mid-level plans cover the powertrain components and the steering, suspension, fuel delivery, cooling and brakes. The powertrain-plus plans are the most affordable, covering the essential, yet major systems – engine, transmission, transfer case, drive axle and differential assembly.","<strong>Vehicle Service Contract</strong>","I looked over all 21 contracts Autopom sells, and the average length received an A grade. On average, the contracts run about 16 pages, but the average words per page is about 330. As such, the contracts aren&#39;t designed to overwhelm you with too much information. As a result, the readability is excellent, earning it another A grade. The formatting is easy to follow. The font isn&#39;t tiny and overly bolded or unnecessarily capitalized like so many other contracts. With vehicle service contracts, you need to read the contracts carefully and this service makes it easy.","The reimbursement policies are average or slightly below average. For example, the rental vehicle policy reimburses you $35 per day with a maximum of $180 if you need a vehicle while yours is being repaired. The best reimbursement policies cover $65 per day, as this is more in line with what rental cars cost. If your car breaks down on a road trip, you are reimbursed up to $225 to cover food and hotel expenses, but this is also average. Some services reimburse up to $450.","With so many vehicle service contracts, Autopom is a service with plans and coverage to fit most vehicles, even if the car is old. The quoting process was excellent and the sales reps weren&#39;t aggressive and pushy, but helpful. If you&#39;re looking for peace of mind, Autopom is a great option."]},"id":"bfcf343d-ca8a-4cc3-9b7b-21f7016edcec","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56943","url":"/autopom-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-07-03T13:49:21Z","datePublished":"2013-07-03T13:49:21Z","name":"Autopom","synopsis":"If the greatest value in an extended car warranty is the peace of mind it brings knowing you can afford unexpected, expensive repairs, then Autopom is one of your best options.","review":{"rating":45,"verdict":"Autopom has a lot of plans to fit most cars, even high-mileage vehicles, and the quoted prices were among the most affordable.","pros":["The average price per mile covered is very low.
