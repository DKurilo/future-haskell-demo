The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-sound-machines\">Sound Machines</a> here.</em>","Standing at a mere 6.5 inches tall, the Sound Oasis Sound Therapy System packs a lot of features into its small body. This sound machine has been specifically designed to aid with sleep problems, whether they be diagnosed or environmentally induced. The manufacturer is, in fact, partners with the Tinnitus Practitioners Association. The TPA dedicates funds to researching different ways of helping those people who suffer from tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and Sound Oasis is one of their recommended products for temporary relief.","Part of the appeal of the Sound Oasis sound machine is its ability to play sounds continuously or on a timer. If you would prefer the music to cease playing after you’ve fallen asleep, simply set the sleep times for 30, 60 or 90 minutes, and the machine will automatically shut off. An alarm clock is not built in, however, so you would not be able to use the Sound Oasis Sound Therapy System as a means to wake you up each morning, just as a way to put you to sleep.","One of our favorite features is the headphone jack built into the back of the sound machine. Along with being able to condense the sound into headphones, pillow speakers are available for purchase, allowing you to experience sound therapy through a comfortable pillow.","Sleep ailments are not only due to those conditions that are diagnosed by a doctor. If you live in an apartment with noisy neighbors, have a spouse that snores, travel for business or simply have trouble clearing your mind at night, a sound machine would truly benefit you. The Sound Oasis Sound Therapy System’s adjustable volume control makes it easy to fine-tune the sound machine to the perfect level ideal for any user. Whether you prefer the noise level to be low and soothing or loud and boisterous, you have that option. Sound Oasis also includes a gradual off feature that makes the sound slowly fade away after a period of time with no abrupt ending. There is even a resume button that will replay the last sound upon selection.","For all of you travelers out there, Sound Oasis understands how foreign beds and new places make sleeping even more difficult. With two different options for powering the sound machine, either with four AA batteries or an AC adapter, this white noise generator is ready to hit the road. This sound machine’s small size is also convenient for hitching a ride in your suitcase.","Six sounds come built into the Sound Oasis Sound Therapy System: ocean surf, summer night, stream, rain, white noise and wind. Compared to its competitors, six is a fairly low selection. However, the Sound Oasis brand is known for its sound card technology which allows you to purchase additional cards in sound packs. For example, you could purchase the Sound Oasis Tropical Rain Forest expansion card which includes six additional sounds: tropical rain, jungle stream, coral reef surf, cascading waterfall, Amazon lagoon and tropical storm. Downloads are also available on the Sound Oasis website."]},"id":"c0d1e20f-dc21-430b-8768-19e1269899bb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"58d573b2-bef2-4bb5-9662-6499d8b2d857","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sound Oasis Sound Therapy System has all of the features we find necessary in a sound machine, except for a built-in alarm clock and an iPod dock.
