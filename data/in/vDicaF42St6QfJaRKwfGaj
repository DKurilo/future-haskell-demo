The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 steam mops <a href=\"/best-steam-mops\">here</a>.</em>","The BISSELL Symphony Pet is a high-end <a href=\"/best-steam-mops\">steam mop</a> that also has a vacuum function, so you can use it for both removing large pieces of debris and cleaning sticky areas. This dual-use device also saves you time and money.","While the price on the BISSELL Symphony is higher than single-function steam mops, this versatile device helps you save in other ways. Having both vacuum and steam mop functions in a single device makes it easier to do a thorough house cleaning without pulling out multiple cleaning tools.","The digital controls make operating the BISSELL Symphony easy. You can set it to vacuum, steam or do both at the same time, depending on the floor and the mess you&#39;re tackling. There is no on-and-off switch, so the steam mop turns on as soon as you plug it in and won&#39;t turn off until you unplug it. This can be frustrating if you want to pause for a few minutes midway through a cleaning job.","While you can vacuum and steam at the same time if desired, this floor steam mop seems to work better if you stick to doing one thing at a time. A five-way adjustable handle keeps your hands comfortable during cleaning sessions, and the cord is 25 feet – plenty of reach when steaming a larger room. However, the head is a bit bulky, making it tough to get into cramped areas. Plus, this floor steamer is designed more like a traditional vacuum and doesn’t have swivel action, so you can only go forward and back. It lacks the maneuverability to move under objects sideways as you can do with most steam mops.","Overall, this vacuum mop combo was one of the top performing products in our hands-on tests. It performed well above average cleaning up the messes we created. It only took 15 passes to remove dried orange juice and 29 passes to remove day-old spaghetti sauce, which was far less work than was required by the average machine. And while its maneuverability was limited, it still handled nicely – more smoothly than most vacuums. We were able to assemble it easily without any tools. The cleaning pad stayed in place nicely and never needed extra attention during testing.","The BISSELL Symphony floor steam mop comes with four microfiber mop pads. The soft pads are used for general cleaning, while the rougher pads are used for scrubbing stubborn debris. These pads are machine-washable, so you don&#39;t need to worry about buying replacements. Plus, they have space for a fragrance disk in case you want to give your floors a fresh scent.","The water tank on this steam mop is not removable, and the cap can be difficult to open when you need to refill the water. The steam dries quickly, which is a bonus for preventing wet floors. The tank capacity is on the low end. It only holds 13 ounces of water, which is enough to steam-clean a small room, but for larger areas will probably require a refill. The tank is not removable, which creates a little more work each time you refill.","The BISSELL Symphony Pet steamer vacuum, as the name implies, works especially well for people with pets because the vacuum function can pull up pet hair before you turn on the steamer. It&#39;s also a great model for people who want to streamline their collection of cleaning tools. However, if you just need a simple steamer mop, you might want to try a less expensive model. This steam cleaner vacuum comes with a generous two-year limited warranty, which will let you get plenty of use out it before it expires."]},"id":"25b40622-682e-4dee-8e35-58ed415dd3b2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f18c436f-2165-49d9-b138-cf7444f27d55","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BISSELL Symphony Vacuum and Steam Mop lets you multitask by picking up the debris before you mop up the mess it leaves behind.
