Obviously, the larger your family or the more you cook, the more space you&#39;ll need in your oven. Families of four or more should look for ranges a capacity of over 4 cubic feet. The LG Studio LSES302ST electric <a href=\"/best-slide-in-ranges\">slide-in range</a> has a massive 5.4-cubic-foot oven chamber so you can bake an entire meal at once, whether you’re cooking for the holidays or every day. The smooth ceramic glass cooktop has five elements with two expandable elements so you can fit big pots for soup or small pans for sautéing. The left front element expands from 6 inches to 9 inches, and the right front element has three sizes for 6-, 9- and 12-inch cookware. These specialized burners bring the heat with top output at 3,000 watts for speedy boiling and 100 watts on the center simmer burner.","Combining smooth-touch knobs and a digital oven display, this LG Profile has a modern look and gives you reliable control over such powerful heat settings. Safety features such as control lock, heat indicator and auto shut-off give you peace of mind if you have small children that could injure themselves around the slide-in range. You can toggle the optional language settings to English or Spanish, and the oven will display the temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius.","Options like convection bake, broil and roast evenly cook your food and eliminate cold pockets from the oven chamber. There’s also a powerful back fan to circulate hot air. The convection conversion feature removes the guesswork from convection cooking. And whether you&#39;re using traditional cooking or convection methods, the speedy pre-heat cuts down on waiting time. You can adjust the split and gliding rack to seven rack positions to accommodate all sizes of dishes. The specialized baking drawer is perfect for rolls, cookies, pies or any other baked goods.","The LG Studio LSES302ST is self-cleaning and features a delay clean option. As for the exterior, the sturdy stainless steel frame is easy to clean with simple stainless steel cleaner. The ceramic glass cooktop is durable, but requires stainless steel cookware and specialized cleaner to avoid streaks, stains and scratches.","With a sleek black and stainless steel finish and a fashionable blue interior, the LG Studio LSES302ST matches any kitchen and gives it a modern look. The warranty for this slide-in electric range lasts two years for parts and labor for any replacement parts. Its large interior and range of options for display, safety and cooking make this range great for big families."]},"id":"c09d8201-ccc8-403c-b4fb-ec7278c394a1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58011","url":"/lg-studio-slide-in-range-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T12:58:37Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T12:58:37Z","name":"LG Studio LSES302ST","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
