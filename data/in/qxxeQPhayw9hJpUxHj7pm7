You choose someone from your contacts, text them the amount via the app and send it with a message. You need to connect your bank account or a debit card to your Circle account in order to add money to transfer. Money sent to you is also added to your Circle account, which you can transfer to your bank account or keep in your Circle account to use for later transactions.","There is no fee on your Circle transactions when you use your bank account or debit card as your funding source. However, if you choose to fund your Circle account using a credit card, you are charged a processing fee and possibly a cash advance fee as well.","This peer-to-peer payment app uses bitcoin on the back end of its transactions. Because it uses this universal electronic currency, you can send money to anyone in the world in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds without paying currency exchange fees. When you receive money through Circle, its converted to U.S. dollars automatically.","Circle accounts are FDIC insured, and the app employs security measures, such as touch ID and PIN codes, to help secure your account on your phone. You can set limits to the amount you can send in a 24-hour period, and it will alert you via text if you exceed that amount.","Circle is a peer-to-peer payment app that lets you send or receive money to your friends and family members around the world. It offers bank-level security, including FDIC insurance for your funds. You need to tie the Circle account to a bank account in order to transfer funds, but it provides an easy way to repay friends and family. It&#39;s a convenient service for the times when you need to give someone money remotely, such as for a quick errand on the way to a surprise party."]},"id":"cc7218aa-7abb-4800-91ec-79db13c772c3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67653","url":"/circle-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-02-05T15:30:15Z","datePublished":"2016-02-05T15:30:15Z","name":"Circle","synopsis":"Imagine that you're planning a surprise party, but as you're decorating the room, you realize that you forgot to buy the balloons.
