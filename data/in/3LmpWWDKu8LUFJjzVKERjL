It measures less than 2 inches square and has a clip on the back panel to attach to a pocket or belt. There are 10 noise profiles that range in frequency from high to low pitch. Also, the volume dial on the side panel makes it easy to select the right volume to mask external noise or provide relief from your tinnitus symptoms. This ultra-compact sound machine has a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 30 hours on a single charge, and it uses a micro-USB connection to fully recharge in less than three hours. It comes with the charging cable and earbuds, but you can use any headphones with a 3.5mm connection.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/d/Baby-Sleep-Soothers/SONEic-Machine-Soothing-Natural-Headphone/B00PJ8QI3G?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">SONEic Sound Machine - $20.99</a><br/>This sound machine isn’t as compact as the Sound Oasis S-001, but it has a better selection of sound profiles and doesn’t require charging. There are four noise profiles, including white, gray, brown and pink noise, as well as six nature sounds. You can power it with four AA batteries, a wall socket or a laptop using the micro-USB connection. The SONEic is available in six colors to match the decor on your desk, and its compact design makes it well suited to small spaces. ","<strong>Sleep Tracker Apps</strong>","According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/index.html\">Centers for Disease Control</a>, one-third of adults in the U.S. report getting less than the recommended amount of sleep. Insufficient sleep is linked to chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Sound machines offer a subtle, but effective, distraction from external noise, but it’s hard to tell how efficient your sleep schedule is. Here are some apps that track your sleep habits, and in some cases, wake you up at the optimal time.","Sleep Cycle<br/>Sleep Cycle is a free app for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-alarm-clock/id320606217?mt=8\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northcube.sleepcycle&amp;hl=en\">Android</a> devices that uses the accelerometer in your phone to record your sleep habits.

The <a href=\"https://www.sleepcycle.com/\">developer’s website</a> has real-time data about sleep patterns for users all around the world, in case you want to compare your sleep habits to people from Europe and Asia.","Pillow<br/>This <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pillow-automatic-sleep-tracker/id878691772?mt=8\">sleep tracker app</a> is most effective when paired with an Apple Watch, but it also tracks and archives your sleep patterns with an iPhone or iPad. The free version includes a detailed sleep stage diagram with information about the length of REM, light sleep and deep sleep. Pillow also allows you to record sounds during sleep, so you can prove to your bedmate that he or she snores or exhibits signs of sleep apnea. The app&#39;s premium version has a $5 one-time fee and adds unlimited sleep history tracking, nap modes and personalized sleep tips.<br/>","<strong>Who Can Benefit From a White Noise Machine? </strong>","Noisy Work Environment<br/>Researchers from the University of British Columbia conducted <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0013916592243006\">scholarly research</a> on the effects of noise masking with white noise machines in a noisy office environment. Their conclusion: “Masked noise subjects performed better than those in the unmasked condition on both complexity and a simple attention task.” If you are having a hard time concentrating in a noisy office and want a sound machine with a white noise profile and headphone output, we recommend the <a href=\"/sound-sleep-review\">Adaptive Sound Technologies Sound + Sleep</a>. This sound machine is a simple, cost-effective way to mask noise and minimize distraction associated with audio sources like music and podcasts. ","Tinnitus Sufferers<br/>The <a href=\"https://www.ata.org/\">American Tinnitus Association</a> lists sound therapy as a masking and distraction solution for Tinnitus symptoms. There are multiple sound therapy options, including hearing aids and sound and sleep apps, but a traditional sound machine with a wide range of sound profiles is less invasive and easier to operate. The ATA suggests that “The noise generated by sound machines can partially or fully mask a patient’s perception of tinnitus, providing relaxation and temporary respite from the condition.” Sound machines don’t cure the condition, but they significantly reduce the perceived ringing and help tinnitus sufferers fall asleep.","Irregular Work Schedule<br/>Employees who work a rotating schedule or night shifts often have trouble aligning their body’s internal clock with external distractions. External stimuli, such as light and noise, send signals to the brain that trigger natural reactions like the release of sleep-inducing hormones and changes in body temperature and digestion. A sound machine helps regulate your internal clock by masking external noises and allowing you to sleep for a full seven to eight hours during the day. We recommend sound machines with a continuous play feature if you need to mask external noises the entire time you sleep.","<strong>How Much Does a Sound Machine Cost?  </strong>","The sound machines we tested range in price from $20 to $50. There are a wide range of free white noise apps available for smart phones, but you’d have to connect your phone to a $30 Bluetooth speaker to get the same volume range as the machines in our comparison. You can also use a sleep machine as a supplement or replacement for expensive sleep medications, which could save you hundreds of dollars annually.","<br/><strong>Key Features to Look For When Buying a Sound Machine</strong>  ","Sleep Timer<br/>Sound machines are designed to help you fall asleep, but once you are asleep, sleep timers turn the sound off so you can slumber in silence. The best sound machines give you multiple timer options. Some have options ranging from 15 to 90 minutes, and the best ones we tested have timers that last up to seven hours. We recommend using the continuous setting for masking noise, rather than allowing the machine to turn off while you’re asleep.","Headphone Output<br/>When you plug headphones into a sound machine that has this output selection, the speaker turns off. That is a helpful feature if you have a bedmate who doesn’t share the same need for calming noises. It can also be helpful for someone who works in a noisy environment and doesn’t want to bother other employees.","Battery Backup<br/>All the sound machines we tested plug into a wall socket, but some use batteries as a secondary power source. Battery operation is handy if you want to travel with your sound machine, especially somewhere that doesn’t have a readily available wall socket, like a campground. Battery operation also keeps the sound machine running during a power outage.","<strong>Sound Machine Mobile Apps </strong>","There is a growing amount of scholarly research that recommends removing your phone from the bedside table. A phone-free night time routine removes a constant distraction, which in turn leads to falling asleep faster and staying asleep longer. The sound machines we tested allow you to distract your brain with white noise and nature sound profiles. However, there are situations where you need a more portable solution. White noise apps, in conjunction with headphones, a Bluetooth speaker or the built-in speaker on your phone can also help you fall asleep.  ","White Noise Lite<br/><a href=\"https://www.tmsoft.com/white-noise/\">White Noise Lite</a> by TM Soft has 40 sound profiles, including nature sounds and a variety of noise profiles. You can also use this app to record customized sound profiles if you enjoy the sound of a city park near your home. The paid version has more alarm settings and full stereo sound, but you still get access to the free downloadable sounds from a seemingly endless library with the Lite version. White Noise Lite is available for Android, Apple and Amazon Alexa-enabled smart speakers.","Rain Rain<br/><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rain-rain/id478687481\">Rain Rain</a> is a free app available for iOS, Android and Amazon devices. It has more than 25 nature sound profiles, including rain, cat purring and thunderstorms. You can even mix profiles to create a custom soothing sound. There are pre-built custom profiles, like the beach bonfire that mixes ocean waves with a crackling campfire sound. Rain Rain has a timer you can set for up to 25 hours and the pulsating effect gently fades the volume of the sound profile up and down. This app can also play in the background while you use your phone to play games or read emails on the bus.","<strong>Using a Smart Speaker as a Sound Machine </strong>","If you don’t take issue with an active listening device near your bed, a <a href=\"/best-smart-speakers\">smart speaker</a> is a great way to play soothing nature sounds or noise profiles while you fall asleep. Each smart speaker manufacturer has an compatible music streaming service with sleepy sound profiles, or you can use a third-party service like Spotify.","<a href=\"/google-home-review\">Google Home</a><br/>The Google Assistant plays noise and nature sounds without downloading a skill or using a music streaming service, but the list is limited to 15 sound profiles. That list covers the most popular profiles, including white noise, ocean sounds and an oscillating fan sound. Unfortunately, the Google smart speakers only play these sounds for a maximum of one hour, and there isn’t a way to set a sleep timer. You can broadcast longer sleep sounds from YouTube or Spotify, but that method requires using a smartphone.","<a href=\"/amazon-review\">Amazon Echo</a><br/>Amazon’s smart speaker lineup doesn’t sound as good as the corresponding Google speakers, but the list of available music and audio Alexa skills is much more comprehensive. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Invoked-Apps-LLC-Relaxing-Sounds/dp/B074YV4VJ3\">Relaxing Sounds</a> skill by Invoked Apps has more than 45 nature and noise profiles, including fan sounds, rain profiles and three colors of noise. Once you add the skill using the Alexa app, say, “Alexa, open Relaxing Sounds” and choose a sound profile. The speaker will loop the profile by default, or you ask Alexa to stop playing after a designated amount of time.","<br/><strong>Online Sound Machines</strong>","The sound machines we tested are the perfect solution for masking external noises with nature sounds and white noise on your bedside table or at a hotel room. However, without a headphone output, they aren’t a good solution for a noisy public office environment. So we tested the best headphone-friendly sound machines for your browser, and here are a couple of our favorites.","Noises.Online<br/>This <a href=\"https://noises.online/\">online sound machine</a> has 30 sound profiles, including nature sounds and three different colors of noise. All the profiles are available on your web browser for free, and you can even record a 30 second loop of your favorite profile to use when you don’t have access to Wi-Fi. You mix and match the different profiles and play multiple sounds at once to create your own custom sound profile. Noises.Online also allows you to choose a tone and liveliness setting and save your favorite setting as a user set that is recalled each time you open the site.","Coffitivity<br/><a href=\"https://coffitivity.com/\">Coffitivity</a> has a limited selection of sound profiles, but they’re free and sound great. You don’t need to download any software, just visit the site and choose from three recordings of coffee shop chatter. The profiles were created by a team of freelancers to help boost creativity in sterile and boring work environments associated with working at a home office. The premium version costs $9 for a one-year subscription and comes with three other sound profiles, including Brazil Bistro and Paris Paradise. ","<strong><br/>Can White Noise Damage Your Brain?</strong>  ","A <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2697852\">recent study</a> conducted by researchers from the Posit Science Corporation and University of California San Francisco addresses the long-term effects of white noise for people suffering from tinnitus. They concluded, “Noise exposure therapies offer a seductive short-term solution for relief but, in the long term, undermine the functional and structural integrity of the central auditory system and the brain more generally.” Although the research suggests that long-term use of non-traumatic noises can impair hearing, we couldn’t find any evidence cited by the authors that white noise, specifically, is linked to negative effects for tinnitus sufferers. It is worth noting that the Posit Science Corporation markets an app called BrainHQ that the aforementioned researchers suggest as a potential treatment.","We found <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01639/full#B101\">conflicting research</a> conducted by scholars from two university medical centers in Germany. Their research focused on the differential effects of white noise in cognitive and perceptual tasks. Although the experiments were conducted on healthy patients instead of tinnitus sufferers, the conclusion was, “These results suggest that white noise has no general effect on cognitive functions.”","We also found a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-00575-0\">recent study of white noise effects</a> on mice that suggests, “Exposure to white noise of moderate intensity for seven days … decreased the proportion of mice with tinnitus symptoms from 51 to 12 percent.” There isn’t much evidence that suggests white noise is a permanent or long-term solution for completely relieving the maddeningly annoying ringing associated with tinnitus, but there also isn’t any evidence that long-term exposure damages your brain. ","<strong>White Noise as a Treatment for ADHD </strong>","A <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/13698836_Goeran_Soederlund\">recent study</a> conducted by researchers at Stockholm University sought to find out if students with attention disorders could benefit from white noise. The researchers concluded that “exposure to white noise resulted in a task improvement that was larger than the one with stimulant medication.” Dr. Soderlund also points out that students who were treated with ADHD medication showed no signs of improved test scores, which leads him to conclude that using auditory noise, like white noise, is a possible non-pharmacological treatment for cognitive ADHD symptoms.","The researchers didn’t make any concrete assumptions about why white noise had a noticeable effect on inattentive children, but it is noted in the report that people with ADHD lack adequate dopamine levels. Dr. Soderlund speculates children with ADHD are easily distracted because of the reduced availability of dopamine, which results in fidgety behavior, like restless foot movements that “translates into a kind of neural-noise in the brain.” The introduction of white noise as an arousal and attention stimulus replaced that fidgety behavior in this study.","It’s worth noting that the students were listening to white noise at 78 decibels, which is about as loud as a vacuum and nearing the threshold of permanent hearing damage. Dr. Soderlund is currently experimenting with different volume levels, but he suggests ADHD students interested in trying white noise treatments wear headphones to reduce the distraction for other students.","<strong>Noise Colors: What’s the Difference? </strong>","During testing, we used the white noise setting on all the sound machines to see how well each product masks external noise. However, there are other colors in the noise spectrum that might be more soothing and effective at masking external noises in your environment. White noise has an equal amount of all the audible frequencies, and the frequencies are transmitted randomly to create an unpredictable mixture of sound. Here are some other noise colors and how they differ from white noise.","Pink Noise<br/>Pink noise is one of the most popular noise colors on most online noise generators. It has a more robust bass profile than white noise and sounds less harsh because each octave has equal power. The ubiquitous shushing sound of pink noise is more like a rainstorm than the high-pitched hissing sound associated with white noise profiles.","Brown Noise<br/>Brown noise doesn’t have an official definition on the <a href=\"https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm\">federal telecommunications’ glossary of terms</a>, but it is one of the most popular noise colors. It sounds like an intense, low-pitched wind storm and has a more pronounced bass sound than pink noise. The brown designation comes from the term “Brownian motion,” which describes the random movement of particles in liquid. Brown noise is a good option for those who need to mask low-frequency noises like the rumble of a train in the distance.","<br/>Blue Noise<br/>Blue noise is the opposite of pink noise. This noise color profile concentrates most of the energy at the high end of the spectrum. It sounds like a hissing snake or spraying water and doesn’t have any bass tones. This high-pitched, shrill sound is mostly used as a treatment for tinnitus sufferers because it masks high frequencies well. "]},"id":"4b27d633-a20c-4689-b9dd-f78c1eeda1ad","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"247d9d7d-776b-41d4-a473-6134bebc09eb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/avantek-review\">AVANTEK White Noise Sound Machine for Sleeping, 20 Non-Looping Soothing Sounds with High Quality Speaker &amp;
