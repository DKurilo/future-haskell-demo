The manufacturer has been associated with kitchen appliances for almost a century, since it began shipping the very first stand mixers in 1919. KitchenAid as a brand began after one of the manufacturer’s wives proclaimed the stand mixer to be the best kitchen aid. KitchenAid dishwashers followed in the 1940s. In the 1950s, KitchenAid bought the Chambers Range Company, which added cooking appliances to the product lineup. KitchenAid refrigerators debuted in the 1980s, followed by blenders in the 1990s. Now, KitchenAid coffee makers take advantage of micro components to conveniently equip a caffeinated society that demands features such as programmable clocks.","If you have a household of coffee drinkers, this could be the best coffee maker for you since it brews 12 cups through a permanent filter into a glass carafe kept hot by a warming plate. Interestingly, a permanent filter is not necessarily better than a paper filter. There is scientific evidence to suggest that paper filters are more effective at trapping certain molecules, found only in coffee, which can raise cholesterol.","When it comes to convenience features, this might be considered by many consumers to be the best drip coffee maker for their tastes. It sports a programmable clock to delay brewing until a time of your choosing. It indicates the water level so that you don’t have to guess. You can sneak a cup during the brew cycle, and it will shut itself off after two hours if you manifest the human tendency to occasionally forget. It has the extra brew-strength feature. The water tank is removable so that you can fill it in the sink and then return it to the unit.","The manufacturer supports users of its coffee makers by telephone or email. The warranty is for one year.","The accompanying instruction booklet is quite good. KitchenAid is one of the few vendors in our review of coffee makers to advocate the use of vinegar for cleaning the unit, without preferring the commercial coffee cleaning solutions. Regular cleaning with vinegar is the best way to ensure that your drip coffee maker continues to make fresh-tasting drinks. Vinegar cleans because it is an acid. It doesn’t cost very much and it can last without refrigeration. You don’t need the commercial coffee cleaning products. Just run vinegar through your coffee makers. You can even dilute it with water by 50 percent."]},"id":"f8767cd3-3606-4d43-9f0d-fe82943d591e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b78b781e-d703-4ca5-8c43-9e5de327af6e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Coffee-making technology has come a long way since 16th century Sufis first imbibed this mildly psychoactive substance to maintain the energy for chanting, dancing and whirling to achieve ecstatic states.
