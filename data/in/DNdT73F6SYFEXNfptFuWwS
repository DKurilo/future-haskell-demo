You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Philips Saeco Poemia HD8327/47 is a sleek and compact <a href=\"/best-espresso-machines\">espresso machine</a> that makes rather good-tasting espresso, and it is easy to use, accepting both pods and ground coffee. It heats up almost immediately, and you can make two shots of espresso at a time.","That said, our tests showed that the results of frothing capabilities were rather unimpressive, and it comes up short as far as certain useful features. When we taste tested the espresso from the Philips Saeco Poemia, the result was a flavorful espresso with a crema that covered the surface of the drink. When you lock the portafilter into place, it turns itself slightly to the left to show that it has been positioned correctly.","The nozzle of the steam wand offers a useful feature: a steady flow of hot water for other drinks such as tea or hot chocolate. But when we tested the wand to froth milk, we got mostly steamed milk and not much foam. We tested five milks: three different dairy milks with varying amounts of fat in them, along with almond and soy milk. We got decent volume and some pleasant foam, but not much of it, which would be disappointing to someone who likes a &#34;dry&#34; cappuccino. (A dry cappuccino is heavy on the foam rather than the steamed milk, while the &#34;wet&#34; variety is just the opposite).","The exterior of the device reaches a temperature of 102 degrees F, which is lower than the 104 degrees F average we found for all the products we tested. You also get well-written instructions and illustrations to help you use and care for your cappuccino maker.","This is a rather quiet cappuccino maker with our tests showing its noise level during operation to be 63.7 decibels, equivalent to the sound of regular conversation at about a distance of three to five feet away. In fact, the Philips Saeco Poemia was the quietest espresso maker of all the products we reviewed. The low operation sound for this espresso maker is a real boon if you&#39;re an early riser who longs for some espresso to start the day right, but does not want to wake up the rest of the household.","This device is equipped with a rather small water reservoir holding only 40 ounces, but that would still work well for a home espresso maker. This comes with a tamper that has a measuring spoon on the other end, which might make some elite espresso lovers turn up their noses. Purists prefer tampers with a flat end so you can press on it to tamp down the coffee grounds in the portafilter. However, we had no problems using this tamper and, if you really want it, you can easily pick up an inexpensive regular tamper to use."]},"id":"d5e19548-25dd-449c-bd53-e6b124a7fcfb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5d1c93f9-a955-4cdf-a68d-29c347cac678","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Philips Saeco Poemia espresso machine makes some good espresso, but it is rather lacking when it comes to the standard of foam required for the best quality cappuccinos, caffe macchiatos, lattes and other drinks consumers expect from an espresso maker."]},"id":"9a8692b5-51af-4ef3-8812-31bc4f47f09b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67392","url":"/philips-saeco-poemia-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-11-04T17:35:47Z","datePublished":"2015-11-04T17:35:47Z","name":"Philips Saeco Poemia HD8327/47","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":67,"verdict":"The Philips Saeco Poemia HD8327/47 produces reasonably good espresso but disappointing frothing results.","pros":["This espresso maker accepts coffee pods or grounds."],"cons":["Our tests resulted in less-than-satisfactory foam."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-11-04T17:35:47Z","id":"DNdT73F6SYFEXNfptFuWwS","meta":{"title":"Philips Saeco Poemia HD8327/47 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"With the Philips Saeco Poemia HD8327/47, you can make tasty espresso using either coffee pods or ground coffee.
