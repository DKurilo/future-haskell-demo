The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/computers/desktops/best-home-computers/\">Home Computer</a> here.</em>","The CybertronPC Forge-C5 is a decent base model PC computer and a fair option for your home or office. It has plenty of storage for all your important media, multiple ports for your peripheral devices, and enough memory to keep up with your activities, whether you’re online or off.","This home computer has a fourth generation Intel i5-4440 processor. It’s a quad-core processor that can handle light to moderate use without issues. The CPU speed clocks in at 3.1GHz, and the integrated audio and graphics cards let you enjoy light gaming our video streaming without slowdown.","The tower includes 1TB of storage. While the best home computers we reviewed have 2TB, this is still enough for most users – 1TB can store plenty of documents and photos. It also has 8GB of memory, which is a good amount for a home computer. If you intend to use your computer mostly for sending emails, creating documents and watching YouTube videos, this machine has you covered.","You can plug a variety of devices into this desktop PC using its four USB 2.0 ports and two USB 3.0 ports. It also has VGA and HDMI ports to connect a monitor or TV. However, it is not Wi-Fi or Bluetooth enabled, which greatly limits your connection options and leaves you dependent on an Ethernet cable. It’s also missing a memory card reader.","The manufacturer includes free lifetime technical support with this product, and you can contact the company by phone, live chat or email. In addition, it comes with a free lifetime labor warranty. The tower is backed by a one-year warranty, and for an additional cost, you have the option to extend that up to three years."]},"id":"23411aa1-1107-4cbc-b8de-b2e1bd2cc965","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f43948e9-924c-4065-8653-c97ea303397f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The CybertronPC Forge-C5 is a decent home computer that can handle light to moderate multitasking, so you binge watch Netflix while writing your latest report for work or school.
