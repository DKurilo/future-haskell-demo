Most baby wraps are made from a long piece of fabric that you must learn to wrap around your body, but the Baby K&#39;tan wraps feature a double-loop design so you don&#39;t have to worry about buckles and wrapping. The design of this company&#39;s wraps holds your baby close and secure, even if you have to bend over while wearing the sling. If you are interested in a design that uses the wrapping method to stay in place, consider the <a href=\"/best-baby-wraps\">Moby Wrap</a>.Â ","These wraps are made from a variety of materials, including 100 percent jersey knit, which provides ultimate comfort for the baby. Other wraps by this baby sling company are made from 100 percent polyester fabric, which is ideal if you are constantly on the move, as it wicks moisture well. A 50/50 cotton and mesh composition reduces both heat and moisture inside the sling and improves your comfort as well.","These slings are also an excellent choice if you&#39;re concerned about the security of slings that use a buckle or loop. They are pre-sewn with two loops, which means no wrapping or awkward attempts to keep your baby secure. There&#39;s also a built-in band to provide back support, making you more comfortable while carrying your baby.","The baby sling carriers come in multiple sizes, which you choose based on your size, not the baby&#39;s. The Baby K&#39;tan website provides size conversion information for both men and women, to ensure maximum comfort and safety. All sizes of these baby carriers are suitable for children weighing 8 to 35 pounds, meaning you can use your carrier for several years as your child grows. The design of the sling also allows you to carry your child in various positions as he or she grows.","Additionally, these baby wraps come in multiple colors, such as black, green, purple and blue. You can add gift wrapping at checkout if you buy one of these products as a gift. If you purchase a Baby K&#39;tan baby wrap on the company website, you can return or exchange the carrier within 30 days of purchase."]},"id":"b8dd388d-76de-4170-8f7e-e11728948d06","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58769","url":"/baby-k-tan-breeze-baby-carrier-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-03T23:51:08Z","datePublished":"2014-02-03T23:51:08Z","name":"Baby K'Tan BREEZE","synopsis":"Baby K'tan provides several baby sling options, including the Baby K'tan Active and the Baby K'tan BREEZE, which is designed to keep your baby cool while next to your body.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Baby K'tan provides several baby sling options, including the Baby K'tan Active and the Baby K'tan BREEZE, which is designed to keep your baby cool while next to your body.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-02-03T23:51:08Z","id":"CQ7oY45D6iFKLjEoZPHirA","meta":{"title":"Baby K'Tan Breeze Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Baby K&#039;Tan provides a handful of baby carriers to make life with a baby easy.
