You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The GPX J100S karaoke machine is an easy-to-use machine, and it works best for casual home use. It is compatible with several music sources and includes one microphone, so it is ready to use right out the box. The lightweight design and dual power source option make setup and transportation easy.","This <a href=\"/best-karaoke-machines\">portable karaoke machine</a> works well with several music source options, including CD, CD+G, CD-R and CD-RW, making it easy to sing along with or listen to popular karaoke tunes as well as your favorite new hits. It also has the capacity to stream music or connect to an external device such as an MP3 player. However, unlike other costlier models, it does not have the capacity to record or save your performance to a USB drive or SD card, or to load music from these sources.","This GPX model has two 6.3 mm microphone jacks, which means you can enjoy singing a solo or duet with a friend. However, the system only comes with one mic, so you&#39;ll have to purchase an additional microphone in order to sing a duet. Multiple volume and audio control options, such as voice echo, add a fun and exciting live feel to your karaoke experience.","The included RCA cable lets you connect the player to a monitor so that you can view lyrics on CD+G discs, and setup is simple, so you can start having fun right away. Running out of power should never be an issue, as the GPX karaoke machine allows you to switch between plugging the system in or running it on batteries. The machine is light, weighing about 8 pounds, and has small dimensions of 13.4 x 11.7 x 8.2 inches. Additionally, there is a large handle on top, making it easy to transportation and store.","This GPX player and its microphone both have a modern matte silver finish, and the machine itself has a simple, streamlined interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate. The colorful LED light display adds fun to your karaoke party, and a digital track display lets you quickly find the right CD track.","The GPX J100S is an affordable and simple piece of karaoke equipment, ideal for casual home use. It makes it easy to sing along with your favorite songs by letting you use different media sources, including CD+G and MP3, and you can connect it to a monitor to read display lyrics. Its small size and bright LED display make it a fun addition to any karaoke party."]},"id":"cd38f469-aceb-43aa-ae89-5094c4557166","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62806","url":"/gpx-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-18T19:28:56Z","datePublished":"2015-02-18T19:28:56Z","name":"GPX J100S","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-18T19:28:56Z","id":"F8MuShNsU95jodje6G4FGD","meta":{"title":"GPX J100S Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of GPX.
