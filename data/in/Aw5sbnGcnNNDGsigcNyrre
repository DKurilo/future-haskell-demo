The Floxite FL-10DS uses a replaceable T5 bulb to simulate daylight for even, accurate makeup application. Its reversible mirror provides traditional single magnification on one side and hyper-detailed 10 times magnification on the other.","The distortion-free glass gives you an accurate view of your face using both the normal and magnified sides of the mirror. Its arm allows for 360-degree angle adjustment, so you can see different views for your face and hair preparations. The mirror is 14 inches tall and an extra-wide 9 inches in diameter. Specialized lighting keeps the mirror cool to the touch while it&#39;s on, which also helps keep you bathroom from heating up while in use. Its base has a slim profile for convenient storage. It must be plugged into an outlet in order to get power. If you would prefer a battery-powered mirror, you might want to considerÂ <a href=\"/best-lighted-mirrors\">Ovente</a>.","Floxite&#39;s bright white light gives a daylight-like appearance and helps you apply accurate amounts of makeup at home or in a professional setting. The 10 times magnification can help when tweezing eyebrows, putting in contacts, removing facial hair and trimming a mustache or nose hair. If you wear corrective eyewear, this level of magnification is helpful when putting on eye makeup while not wearing your glasses. The circular light helps prevent any unwanted shadows.","This mirror cannot run on batteries and requires access to an outlet to work, which limits its portability. While some lighted mirrors are quite ornamental, this one is fairly basic. However, the slim, white style should look appealing in most bathrooms and bedrooms. It is small enough to fit on most tables and counters. The manufacturer does not provide an additional warranty for this product.","The mirror arm on the Floxite FL-10DS is adjustable, allowing you to choose the best angle for your situation. Its light simulates daylight for accuracy, and it has a wide 9-inch diameter. The 10 times magnification is helpful for those who need glasses put on makeup or tweeze eyebrows without having to wear their corrective lenses."]},"id":"f8bb3f3d-c947-417e-a646-5368bf720835","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66158","url":"/floxite-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-10T21:46:01Z","datePublished":"2015-07-10T21:46:01Z","name":"Floxite FL-10DS","synopsis":"If you are putting on makeup in a small shared space like a dorm room or apartment, a lighted vanity mirror can be a useful asset to your beauty routine.
