Clicking the Buy button will take you to this version for purchase. The manufacturer lists the new version as offering enhanced SSD file optimization. We will evaluate, rank and review O&amp;O Defrag 22 when we next update the Disk Defrag Software reviews. Meanwhile, enjoy our review below about the O&amp;O Defrag 21 Professional.</em>","O&amp;O Defrag uses one dashboard for three different services. It offers support for <a href=\"/best-disk-defragmenter-software\">disk defragmentation</a>, and it also checks for duplicated files and startup inefficiencies. Together, these three services can scan through your most important data so that you don’t need to download or run additional programs to keep your computer running in pristine condition. The program works on all recent versions of Windows, so it’s great for your brand-new laptop as well as your parents’ clunky old desktop. It’s compatible with traditional hard drives (HDD) as well as newer solid-state drives (SSD) and is great for optimization.","Though you have the option to run it manually, this disk defragmenter works as a background application and is capable of scanning several hard drives at once, which means you don’t have to leave your computer on overnight when you want to run a simple operation. You can also schedule a single or recurring scan to run at a specific time with this software. If you want this application to run every day while you head out for lunch, you can select the time and frequency that works for you.","Beyond disk defragmentation and cleanup, O&amp;O Defrag provides a scan made just for startup applications. This process locates your boot files and places them in a location where they can be quickly accessed. It works with larger files, including video files, and can somewhat improve the speed your games run. If you prefer a defrag program aimed at boosting game speeds, however, check out <a href=\"https://software/utilities/best-disk-defragmenter-software/smart-defrag-server-review/\">Smart Defrag</a>.","The reports show lifetime performance statistics so that, should you ever need to go back to see, for example if a particular program is slowing you down, you can do that. It also shows the standard defragmenting and disk-usage statistics.","This application also works with solid-state drives. Instead of a full defragmentation scan, O&amp;O Defrag checks SSD storage for unused or unimportant files. Fragmentation does not affect a solid-state drive the same way it does a traditional hard drive. This program therefore tells your system where to find these sectors so that new files can be saved in their place.","The program comes with a built-in disk cleaner, which can remove duplicates and old registries, unneeded histories and other old or unwanted data in order to free up space that can be defragmented and therefore used more efficiently and effectively. By deleting this extra information, you increase available HDD space. Further, permanently deleting this information can help prevent identity theft as well, because deleting files under Windows may not actually remove the file from your disk. Rather, it simply removes it from view but may leave traces of data that spyware can pick up.","O&amp;O Defrag works with Windows 10 (both versions), but it’s also a capable disk defragmenter for older versions of the operating system including Windows 8.1, 8, 7 or Vista. It doesn’t include a trial period, and licenses are purchased on a per-computer basis."]},"id":"75bb16e7-76ce-42e0-b0e9-580b16a48d86","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49747","url":"/o-o-defrag-professional-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-06-10T17:25:12Z","datePublished":"2010-06-10T17:25:12Z","name":"O&O Defrag 21 Professional","synopsis":"Editor's Note: O&O Defrag 22 is now available.
