The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-over-the-range-microwaves\">Over-the-Range Microwave Ovens</a> here.</em>","The Jenn-Air JMV8208WS is a simple model that includes all of the basic features we hope to see in over-the-range microwaves. It is more expensive than similar models, yet it does not have convection cooking, something that we would expect to see for the price. Other models in this series offer convection, but for an even higher cost. All the models in the Jenn-Air JMV series do have sensor and auto cooking options along with a versatile ventilation system.","Like most of the models we reviewed, this over-range microwave has sensor and auto cooking functions. The humidity sensors automatically detect the doneness of your food, so you won&#39;t have to stop the microwave, test the temperature of your food and add more time manually. Sensor cooking will make sure that your popcorn is not burned and your baked potato is fork-tender. Auto reheat will return your leftovers to the perfect temperature without overdoing it or drying them out. The auto defrost has your frozen meat and veggie ready to cook in a matter of minutes, and if you aren&#39;t ready to eat right away, the keep warm option will make sure your food is still hot and ready to eat when you are.","The exterior of this built-in microwave is average-sized, and its large-capacity interior provides ample cooking space. The included cooking rack also doubles the amount you can cook at one time. With 1,000 watts and 10 power levels, this microwave is on par with its competitors, but the three-stage programmable memory is a feature others don&#39;t include. This allows you to set three different power levels and three different lengths of time. This microwave will automatically adjust the power levels according to your specifications without your having to stop the microwave and enter new information.","Over-the-range microwave ovens don&#39;t just cook. They also replace the range hood ventilation system for your stovetop. The Jenn-Air JMV&#39;s ventilation system is more versatile than others. In addition to the standard recirculation and exterior wall ventilation, this system can also be installed to vent through your ceiling if the design of your kitchen allows for it. The models in this series have articulating vents, meaning the vent opens when it&#39;s operating and closes when it&#39;s off. The fan clears the air at multiple speeds, and it even automatically starts if it detects too much heat or any smoke. The hood has cooktop lights to illuminate your stovetop, and they may be programmed to turn on and off at specific times.","This over-range microwave is not the most attractive design in our lineup, but it is not a bad looking unit. It comes in black and two different stainless steel finishes, so it will match many kitchen palettes. The keypad is simple to use, and the flat buttons allow for easy cleaning.","One inconvenience we encountered with this model is that the manufacturer does not allow retailers to list a price. We had to email a dealer to receive prices, but the dealer responded almost immediately. The website is good looking and easy to use. You can reach customer care by phone, email and even online chat. The manufacturer offers a standard one-year warranty on parts and labor, and they cover the main cooking component – the magnetron – for a full five years."]},"id":"1a8fcda2-1dd3-44b3-9ad6-3b2864bf6cbd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"66564f48-1856-4fd2-91d5-8d35a0df22c4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Jenn-Air JMV8208WS is an average model for an above average price.
