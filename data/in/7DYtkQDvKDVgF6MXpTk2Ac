We either bought them or had the manufacturers send us testing copies. We simulated the hands-on experience of a typical consumer. Manufacturers had no input on our testing methodology, and our results were not released to them ahead of publication.","We spent more than 240 hours designing dozens of kitchens. Our reviewer team noted how easy each program was to learn and use. They also compared common tools found in each program. When testing was complete, our reviewers weighed the hard data they collected against their subjective experiences to determine which programs are the best and why.","We also spoke with professional designers about what people should know before making their own kitchen plans. Trevor Broughton is the lead designer at <a href=\"http://www.mountainwestarchitects.com/\">Mountain West Architecture</a> in Ogden, Utah. He told us that novice users probably lack the skill necessary to design a buildable plan. “My biggest concern with anything brought to me is that it is scalable and accurate,” Broughton said, adding that the most common problem people have is grasping spacial flow. “Most people do not speak that language,” said Broughton.","He went on to say that kitchen design software made for non-professionals could help. “Consumer grade software could allow someone to really grasp how much space is absorbed by each architectural element,” Boughton said. “It lets them work through some of the issues before they come to us so we can get a more concise interpretation on our end.”","We also spoke with Gregg Hodson of Salt Lake City, Utah. He is the owner of an independent design firm and has been designing commercial, health care, retail and residential interiors for 27 years.","We asked him about the most critical aspects of interior design. Hodson said, “I don’t do anything without a space plan. I want everything to the inch. That’s what makes the difference in a well-designed space. Every inch counts: the arm height of the sofa, the table, the height of the side table, you’ve got to make all those work so in the end it all comes together flawlessly.”","We asked him about his experiences being given home made designs by potential clients. He pointed out that most people don’t have the knowledge or experience to understand how to create a proper plan. Hodson indicated the programs we reviewed could be helpful. “I think [they] could be very useful to a lay-person,&#34; he said, &#34;because that’s where they need to start.”","<strong>How We Tested<br/></strong>Our expert reviewers gathered 15 separate kitchen design programs and used them to make several test plans. They evaluated how easy each program was to learn for someone who has no previous knowledge of design software. They also graded several features, such as the drag-and-drop tool and photo importer. They took meticulous notes about their personal experiences, what they liked and didn’t like about each program. They also evaluated each program’s custom design tools that allow you to create objects such as cabinets, fireplaces, windows, doors and furniture.","Each program was used to create a test kitchen. This test design was duplicated across all the programs we reviewed. Our reviewers noted how long it took to create the design, what tools were required, and how easy it was to put together. They exported each design and compared the resulting plans with what was in the computer, noting any differences or deficiencies. They also meticulously combed through each product, evaluating every tool they found; nothing was left unused during our evaluation phase.","We also reached out to the manufacturers’ customer help and support services. We asked them common questions, and posed issues regarding their software. We noted how informed and friendly the support staff was, and how easy it was to find information on the companies’ websites. ","If you don’t have much experience with kitchen design software, pick a sample plan to customize as a jumping-off point.","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying Kitchen Design Software</strong>","Create Quickly<br/>When we used each of the kitchen design programs, we took note of how easy each one was to use. Each program has unique features to make them accessible to typical users. <a href=\"/home-designer-interiors-review\">Home Designer Interiors</a> has a tool that allows you to import images of existing plans for kitchens and other rooms. This lets you build on existing kitchen designs, which is great if you’re remodeling. Some programs also have a quick-start wizard that shows construction requirements for things like walls, windows and doors. This feature is helpful for those new to kitchen design. ","Objects &amp; Décor<br/>Kitchen designs are more than just floor plans. You’ll want to include everything that belongs in your new kitchen, such as appliances, cabinets, plants and tables. Each program comes with a library of preprogrammed objects that you can place in your design. The best programs are also compatible with third-party object databases such as SketchUp and Trimble 3D Warehouse. The more objects available, the more versatile the software. ","Customize<br/>Once you have your designs in place, you can customize them until you get exactly what you want. The best kitchen design software not only allows you to add furniture and other objects, but also change their color, texture, materials and more. Some have specialty design tools such as cabinet designers that let you fine-tune small details like paint finishes and wood grains. ","Construction Tools<br/>Planning a kitchen that is functional as well as beautiful involves determining what goes inside as well as outside of the walls. If your kitchen remodel is a complete overhaul, look for software that lets you plan HVAC, plumbing and electrical configurations. This way you know where to put outlets, light fixtures, heating and air vents. Without planning for these essentials first, you will not know if your ideal plan is even feasible.","It&#39;s always a good idea to enlist the help of licensed contractors for tasks involving electrical and plumbing work. Whether you are an expert at construction or need professional help, consider using kitchen design software either way. The best software lets you save your finalized plans to a PDF file, so that you can share them with a contractor via email for quotes and feedback.<br/><br/>How Much Does Kitchen Design Software Cost?<br/>Expect to pay anywhere from $25 to $100 for kitchen design software. But before you buy, you should consider what you need and what you don’t. For instance, Virtual Architect Instant Maker only costs $24, but lacks many features compared to the $100 Punch Home &amp; Landscape Design Premium.","<strong><br/>More Home Design Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"0b2f40c1-5b1d-434a-bf3e-7524b0e29bc3","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-cad-software\">The Best CAD Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-home-design-software\">The Best Home Design Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-home-and-interior-design-software-for-mac\">The Best Home Design Software for Mac</a>","<a href=\"/best-interior-design-software\">The Best Interior Design Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-landscaping-software\">The Best Landscaping Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-mac-landscaping-software\">The Best Landscaping Software for Mac</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"46d8628a-6834-4f0a-a8ca-e7744e40ea33","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_60","url":"/best-kitchen-design-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
