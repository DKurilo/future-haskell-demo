In fact, its espresso scored the highest in our taste tests. This is no surprise since it has a pre-infusion system, which means the machine soaks your coffee grounds before it begins extracting. This results in a fresher, more flavorful shot.","Pre-infusion technology is normally reserved for more expensive and professional machines, so it’s big boon to have it on a consumer-level model such as this one.  <br />\n  <br />\nSome of the products we reviewed take several minutes to bring water to the appropriate temperature, but the Breville Infuser has a thermocoil heating system that warms water in less than a minute. This is especially important if you have a tight morning routine or need to get out the door in a hurry.    <br />\n   <br />\nThe Infuser makes it easy to brew espresso with its two dedicated buttons: one for a single shot and one for a double shot. There’s also a programmable button you can set to your own unique preferences; once that’s done, all you do is put your cup under the spout and push the button.   <br />\n   <br />\nThis espresso maker also creates excellent froth. It comes with a stainless-steel milk jug that you place under the frothing wand. If you know what you’re doing, it only takes a few seconds to get high-quality, tasty froth.   <br />\nThe last feature worth noting is the machine’s tamper. All the other models we tested included tampers made of flimsy plastic that were only marginally effective.

With the help of a seasoned barista, we tested each espresso machine with the same brand, roast and grind of coffee for each shot pulled – initially, anyway.","The result from each espresso machine was different. We found that machines without pressurized portafilters, or filter baskets, required a finer grind. It was easy to spot the high-quality shots by their crema alone, but we also relied on testers&#39; taste buds to determine which machines made the most consistent and tasty espresso."]},"id":"26166675-a711-4e60-a21a-acc38f430417","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/AeA8Kah6kPvHWr7ozyQ9cm.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/espresso-machines/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9XL1kvNzU2NzU0L29yaWdpbmFsL0VzcHJlc3NvLU1hY2hpbmVzLVRlc3RpbmctMDA4LmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AeA8Kah6kPvHWr7ozyQ9cm.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"AeA8Kah6kPvHWr7ozyQ9cm","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AeA8Kah6kPvHWr7ozyQ9cm.jpg","alt":""},"id":"88d8656b-5d81-4ebb-9103-9f7c29da0772","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Since an espresso machine doubles as a cappuccino maker, we tested each one’s ability to create tight microfoam out of a variety of milks, including whole, low-fat, skim, soy and almond milk. We used exactly 4 ounces of milk for each steaming test and made sure to heat it to about 150 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit. There were a few automatic steamers that produced better results than the steam wands because they are regulated, but you don’t get as much control.","Most commercial espresso machines use only 9 bars (a unit of measurement that refers to atmospheric pressure) of pressure, which is all that’s needed to properly brew a good cup of espresso. Most espresso machines made for home use list that they use 15 bars or more. The difference here is in the type of pump they use, and it’s why the best commercial espresso machines cost more. The vibratory pumps home espresso machines use need to create 15 bars of pressure to get the required 9 bars to the portafilter. However, anything more than 15 bars is superfluous.<br/><br/>Convenience<br/>Automatic espresso makers are much easier to use than manual machines, so when we evaluated how easy they are to use, we graded on a curve. With a manual machine, you need a basic understanding of how fine you should grind your coffee beans and how much pressure to apply when tamping them in the portafilter. An auto machine doesn’t require any expertise. Once you understand how to grind your beans and pull a quality shot, though, it’s like second nature.","We started by timing how long each espresso maker took to heat up, but we gave up because every machine was ready to brew in less than a minute. However, some machines require you prime the pump, or rather, the boiler. It’s a good habit to get into and only needs to be done when you haven’t used the machine in a while. Self-priming machines are more convenient and more hands-off than the others.","It’s also important to know what sort of maintenance your espresso maker needs. We cleaned each machine according to the manufacturer’s suggestions and noted how difficult it was, then assigned the maker a comprehensive maintenance score."]},"id":"b0f18e8a-064c-42c9-ae6b-28712f507738","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/poHLMvyckGXfzwUJhosyT9.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/espresso-machines/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9XL1gvNzU2NzUzL29yaWdpbmFsL0VzcHJlc3NvLU1hY2hpbmVzLVRlc3RpbmctMDA1LmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/poHLMvyckGXfzwUJhosyT9.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"poHLMvyckGXfzwUJhosyT9","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/poHLMvyckGXfzwUJhosyT9.jpg","alt":""},"id":"d18236b6-18e2-49c9-9888-718b883d4355","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/>Little details, such as a removable cup tray or adjustable grouphead that allows for bigger cups, are important to consider. We also noted which machines include a cup-warming tray, which is convenient because espresso cools very quickly. A larger water reservoir cuts down on maintenance, and an auto-shutoff is an invaluable safety feature, especially on mornings when you’re just not awake enough to remember to turn off the machine.","Safety<br/>We checked the temperature of each espresso machine’s exterior as it brewed. Most of the machines were warm to the touch but didn’t burn. A status light that lets you know when the espresso machine is on can also help prevent accidental burns, in case you inadvertently press buttons. Makers with an auto shut-off feature received more credit than those without one.<br/><br/>Accessories<br/>The best espresso machines include all the pieces you need to get started right away, although none of the makers we reviewed include shot glasses. We didn’t score products based on their accessories because these extras don’t make or break the quality of the machine. Also, some of the best cappuccino makers are either super automatic or pod machines that don’t require the extra bits.","Some manufacturers include a pitcher for frothing milk so you can make a cappuccino or mocha right out of the box. The semi-automatic espresso machines include at least one portafilter, but some may include a second one or a pod-adaptable filter. Most makers also come with a tamping tool, and some include a measuring spoon.<br/><br/>Warranty &amp; Support<br/>Espresso machine warranties vary between one and two years. We found that the best home espresso makers we tested offer support at least by email, and most of them offer phone customer care. Other manufacturers offer live chat assistance, too. All the espresso machines we tested have user manuals you can access online.","<strong>Save Money with an Espresso Machine</strong>","These machines make more than just espresso; they can create a variety of coffee drinks. In fact, if you learn to use the features of these machines, you can replace your morning trip through the Starbucks drive-thru with a homemade cup for the road.","If you buy lattes at coffee shops regularly, the cost over the course of a year can really add up. For example, if you were to buy just one Cafe Latte from Starbucks every workday for a year, you would spend roughly $1,079 annually. ","At the time of this writing, <a href=\"/breville-review\">our best choice espresso maker</a> is just $500, and depending on how you prepare your drinks, you might get dozens of cups from a single bag of coffee. If you drink lattes every day, you’ll appreciate the savings. You’ll also be thankful you no longer have to wait in the drive-thru line."]},"id":"dfecf9ef-e870-42ad-893c-3722da020b52","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_265","url":"/best-espresso-machines","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
