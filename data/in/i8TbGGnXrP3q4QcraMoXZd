One of those options is iCash, which, while an older software that does not get frequent updates, still offers solid tools to help you manage your budget, track your expenses and plan out your finances.","A handy feature of newer services is the ability to connect directly to your bank account in order to download transactions and keep your ledger up to date. This is not a feature that iCash offers. However, you can upload OFX, QIF and CSV files with your transactions that you download from your bank. While this is a less convenient choice than direct sync, it is still easier than entering in all of your transactions manually. Although, you will have to regularly upload files or manually upload them after that point. This software also does not have mobile apps.","As mentioned above, this financial management software is older and is not very intuitive. It also requires you to fill out all required information with little direction to add a new transaction. This can be confusing to know which information is required and which account it is referring to. However, once you catch on to the process, this is not so much of an issue, but the initial learning curve is higher than with the best home financial software. This personal finance program does save information, such as payees and the associated accounts, which is convenient for frequently used information.","When creating a budget itself, you can view actual spending and set limits based on the information provided, but you can customize and change any element in the budget as well. You can edit individual categories, and the program totals the expenses for each section for a quick overview. There is also an overview of the budget, offering weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual totals for incomes, expenses and liabilities. Another useful feature is the statistics tab, which provides a monthly overview of spending and income.","When running reports with this software, it also less intuitive initially. But there are solid reporting options; you can run reports for your net worth, spending and cash flow, among other choices. You can customize the dates to view specific periods. If you are a visual learner and prefer seeing data than reading it, you can view reports as charts as well. These reports can be export into OFX, QIF and CSV files to save or import into other software.","While you cannot sync to your brokerage accounts, you can keep track of your investments with this software. You can upload your stocks, bonds and other securities; manage your portfolio; and run reports to analyze your asset allocation."]},"id":"f53c54bc-8cdb-4f65-91ef-334ebca05a15","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8d6be114-2c62-411e-ac2e-dd65d44a58ac","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This home personal finance software, while dated and not the easiest to use, still provides solid budgeting options.
