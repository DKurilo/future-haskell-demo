You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Pacific Image Memor-ease ST converts 35 mm slides and negatives as well as 120 film to a digital format, but it is unable to provide digital copies of your already printed photos. It has automatic color correction and dust- and scratch-removal technology, so you can touch up damaged images. The 9 MP image sensor <a href=\"/best-slide-to-digital-image-converters\">converts slides to digital</a> JPEG images, which can then be viewed on the 2.7-inch color LCD screen located on the top of the unit.","Pacific Image is the only manufacturer on the market that has a built-in feature that lets you clean up your images as you convert them. This hardware-based feature is called Magic Touch. While this is a useful addition, in our testing it slowed down image conversion times. This slide converter is still faster than a flat bed scanner, but it is not a speedy as its competition.","The Memor-ease ST has a stand-alone design that works independently of a computer and software. It comes with a TV-out jack, so you can view images on your television. A USB cable is included to connect the unit to your computer to view and transfer your images. The device is compatible with all Windows and Mac operating systems.","This converter doesn’t have any internal memory. The good news is that with an expandable memory of up to 32GB, you can copy a large volume of photos onto an SD card. However, the SD card is not included, so you have to purchase one separately. Included with this unit is a user manual, USB cable, TV-Out cable, A/C adapter, 35 mm film holder, 35 mm slide holder and 120 film holder.","The Memor-ease ST comes with a one-year warranty. The support page on the Pacific Image website provides troubleshooting and tips, and there&#39;s a drop-down menu that directs you to an online manual for help. A helpful FAQs page covers installation and general problems that you may encounter while using the converter. There is also direct email and telephone contact information for technical support. We were impressed with technical support staffs’ knowledgeable responses to our questions. Contacting other departments was not as easy, and we received no response to emails sent elsewhere in the company."]},"id":"8b83f365-3e8a-4244-b726-d43e06d52e5e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"76608584-2d5a-4d9e-9457-4abd7c8168c9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pacific Image Memor-ease ST has a simple design and is easy to use.
