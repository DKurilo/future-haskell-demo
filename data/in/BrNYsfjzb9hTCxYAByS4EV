Credit merchant accounts allow a business to accept credit cards as payment for goods and services. In a way, these accounts act as a contract between the business owner and the bank. Rules defining how products will be bought, sold and paid for are set; any violation of these rules is considered fraud.","<strong>The Merchant Account Application Process</strong>","When your application for a merchant credit card account is being considered, two entities participate: An ISO (Independent Service Organization) and an underwriter. Usually the ISO also serves as the underwriter. The ISO evaluates the future success and risk of the applicant and approves or denies an account. If the merchant violates the terms of the agreement, the underwriter/ISO will shut down the <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">merchant account</a>.","<strong>Types Of Credit Card Merchant Accounts</strong>","There are two different kinds of merchant card accounts available: The &#34;Over-the-counter&#34; (OTC) and the &#34;money-order/telephone-order&#34; (MOTO). Over-the-counter merchant accounts are used primarily for retail merchants. These types of accounts typically have lower discount rates and transaction fees because the customers&#39; credit cards are physically present at the point of transaction.","Money order, telephone order and online accounts are used primarily for Internet-based businesses. The transaction requires two steps instead of one. Once all of the card information is entered, the data is verified and then the money is subtracted from the cardholder&#39;s limit and placed in a 30-day holding account without actually charging the card. After the product is shipped the credit card is charged for the purchase price."]},"id":"6d547129-1005-4ef9-aa3f-c76340a4a5f5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_389","url":"/what-is-a-merchant-account","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"brian-van-ness","url":"/author/brian-van-ness","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","name":"Brian Van Ness","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:03:59Z","id":"i7BXr7nU3ztSUeuKAUchK4","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T20:51:49Z","name":"What is a Merchant Account / ISO?","synopsis":"Merchant Accounts vs. \"Ordinary\" Bank Accounts\nA merchant account isn't the same as an ordinary bank account even though you can set one up through an ordinary bank.","review":{},"strapline":"Merchant Accounts vs. \"Ordinary\" Bank Accounts\nA merchant account isn't the same as an ordinary bank account even though you can set one up through an ordinary bank.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-08-02T20:51:49Z","id":"BrNYsfjzb9hTCxYAByS4EV","meta":{"title":"What is a Merchant Account / ISO?","description":"A credit merchant account allows a business to accept credit card payments for products and services.
