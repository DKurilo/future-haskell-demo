You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Char-Broil Signature is a four-burner <a href=\"/best-gas-grills\">gas grill</a> that heats quickly and can handle up to 24 burgers at once, making it ideal for large families or groups. Although it didn&#39;t cook as evenly as other grills in our testing, it&#39;s a good, affordable option. This outdoor gas grill’s stainless steel design is fairly easy to clean and maintain.","The four main burners are rated up to 30,000 Btu, which is average for gas grills of this size. The grill also has a 13,000-Btu side burner with a cover that folds down so you can use the space as a side table when burner isn’t being used. You can start up the burners quickly with an electric ignition.","In our tests, this Char-Broil reached 500 degrees Fahrenheit in around three minutes. Similar to other models that heated quickly in our review, it didn&#39;t retain heat well. While the grill is effective for most tasks, it didn&#39;t cook very evenly across the grilling surface. Foods near the edges didn&#39;t cook as evenly in our tests as those in the middle. The 530-square-inch cooking area is the largest in our review and can cook up to 24 burgers at a time. The warming tray holds 10 buns.","This grill is made of stainless steel, including the lid, control panel and burner knobs. When properly cared for, stainless steel resists rust and wear. The cooking grates are also made of stainless steel, and they aren&#39;t as easy to clean as those made of cast iron, which are found on a few gas barbecue grills we tested. Unlike most manufacturers, Char-Broil does not include accessory hooks on most of its grills, but you can buy these separately to attach to either side table. You can also buy a rotisserie kit and a condiment rack for this grill.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"1db6f7fb-3553-4166-8ff6-92e291c69601","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Char-Broil Signature&#39;s stainless steel burners are covered by a 10-year warranty, which is one of the best in our gas grill review.
