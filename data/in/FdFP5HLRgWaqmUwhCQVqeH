On top of that, it sports a durable design with a braided cable. However, there aren&#39;t many length options.","This cable only comes in three lengths: 1 meter (3.3 feet), 2 meters (6.6 feet) and 5 meters (16.4 feet). It can&#39;t sustain the required 10.2 Gbps bandwidth in higher lengths. Additionally, it holds a UL Class 2 safety rating for in-wall installations instead of the CL3 rating that&#39;s required for longer cables. If you need a CL3 rated cable that works for longer lengths, try the <a href=\"/audioquest-high-speed-with-ethernet-hdmi-cable-review\">AudioQuest Pearl</a>.","The cable is also certified as an HDMI cable with Ethernet. The Ethernet component provides an internet connection and eliminates the need for an additional Ethernet cable. It also provides a stronger signal than a wireless connection. However, the Ethernet component only works with devices that are equipped to accept the technology.","The SIIG cable is RoHS certified for being free of hazardous substances. However, it is not HDCP certified. The HDCP certification would verify that the cable includes a protocol that prevents the unauthorized duplication of copyrighted material, which can cause issues with viewing your content. The other products we reviewed, including the <a href=\"/monoprice-review\">Monoprice Select</a>, are all HDCP compliant.","The SIIG cable is constructed of 28-AWG wire, oxygen-free copper conductors, and 24-karat gold-plated connectors. It also includes triple-layer shielding inside the cable that reduces noise and interference from other electrical signals nearby. This cable can handle 1080p, 3D and 4K video signals.","The SIIG ProHD is available in lengths up to 5 meters (16.4 feet), and there are only two other length options. However, the braided cable and excellent design make this a good cable if you&#39;re willing to pay a premium. This certainly isn&#39;t the most cost-effective cable on the market. Still, this cable can handle any video signal you throw at it and works well in most home theater setups."]},"id":"b25e4abc-0761-446d-99d1-c317a4bcb8c2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53526","url":"/siig-prohd-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-30T20:06:18Z","datePublished":"2011-08-30T20:06:18Z","name":"SIIG ProHD","synopsis":"The SIIG ProHD with Ethernet is certified as a High-Speed HDMI Cable, which means it has a bandwidth of at least 10.2 Gbps (gigabits per second), as established by HDMI Licensing, LLC.
