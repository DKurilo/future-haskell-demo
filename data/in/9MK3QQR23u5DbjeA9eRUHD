Countless pictures, voice recordings, memos, calendar dates and phone numbers travel around with us everywhere we go, and we always assume that those pieces of information will be readily accessible whenever we need them.","Yet, life can be unpredictable, and all electronic devices have the potential to fail. Whether from an unsuccessful upgrade, a forgotten password, or more catastrophic situations like water damage or theft, our most precious and vital information can be gone in a flash. Backing up your most important data is a crucial step in today’s gadget-reliant world, but oftentimes we forget to actually back up our information until it’s too late.","Luckily, solutions exist to take some of the most immediate pressure off of a data loss situation. Some of the top recovery tools include <a href=\"/iphone-data-recovery-review\">Tenorshare iPhone Data Recovery</a>, <a href=\"/data-recovery-for-iphone-review\">Data Recovery for iPhone</a>, <a href=\"/mobisaver-review\">EaseUs MobiSaver</a> and <a href=\"/phonerescue-review\">iMobie PhoneRescue</a>.","<strong>iOS Data Recovery: What to Look For</strong>","A wide range of iPhone recovery tools exist, but knowing which one is right for your situation can be confusing. Here are some key factors to consider when you’re in need of an effective recovery solution.","<strong>Compatibility</strong><br/>The first thing to look for when it comes to data recovery for iPhone is a program that is compatible with your device. As newer generations of iPhones and iPads roll out, recovery software is doing an adequate job of keeping up, but not every program is compatible with every generation. The specs are usually pretty easy to find on a developer’s website. Know the model and iOS of your device to ensure that prospective recovery programs will be compatible.","You must also verify that the iPhone recovery software you select is compatible with your home computer. Although iOS recovery programs deal with data recovery on Apple devices, some programs are only designed for use on a PC. On the other hand, some programs are only for compatible with a Mac computer. Because proprietary software is the exception and not the rule, it is easy to assume that a chosen program will have both versions available. Double-check this before you buy it. If you mistakenly assume that a program has both versions, and you are incorrect, you may not be able to return it.","<strong>Recovery Methods</strong><br/>Three main types of iOS data recovery exist: direct scan, iTunes backup and iCloud backup. Direct scan, as its name implies, involves connecting your device to a home computer via USB and scanning it for any salvageable files. The iTunes backup method requires you to have previously synced your with your iTunes account; from there you can restore the most recent backup. These iTunes files may be encrypted, so selecting a program that can deal with encrypted files is imperative if you want to restore data using this method. The final method is the iCloud backup, which is similar to iTunes in that you must have previously synced your device to your iCloud account.","<strong>Cost</strong><br/>The price of recovery software can vary, so it pays to make sure that a program fully meets your needs before you purchase it. Many sites offer free trials with limited functionality. If you are intimidated by computer software, make sure your chosen program has a tech support line listed on its website, or a money-back guarantee at the very least.","Losing data can be potentially devastating, but there are plenty of iOS recovery tools available to ensure that all is not lost forever. Your first line of defense should be regularly scheduled backups, but a good recovery software system can help you restore data you failed to adequately back up in the first place."]},"id":"c4d6a25b-575c-4425-ba66-a124b66c4887","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"2b6e4907-8872-40e6-a14a-9fcc6951221b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://secure.avangate.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4574944&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=1896&CART=1\">Leawo iOS Data Recovery</a>","<a href=\"https://store.aiseesoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4608805&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=1896&CART=1\">Aiseesoft FoneLab</a>","<a href=\"https://secure.avangate.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4636228&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=1896&CART=1\">SynciOS</a>","<a href=\"https://shopper.mycommerce.com/checkout/cart/add/46691-17?affiliate_id=22430\">EaseUs MobiSaver</a>","<a href=\"http://www.datarecoveryforiphone.com/\">Data Recovery for iPhone</a>","<a href=\"https://secure.avangate.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4576791&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=1896&CART=1\">WinAVI iPhone Data Recovery</a>","<a href=\"http://www.tenorshare.com/products/iphone-data-recovery-win.html\">Tenorshare iPhone Data Recovery</a>","<a href=\"https://secure.avangate.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599664&AFFILIATE=1896\">Dr. Fone for iOS</a>","<a href=\"https://shopper.mycommerce.com/checkout/cart/add/39968-23?affiliate_id=22430\">iMobie PhoneRescue</a>","<a href=\"https://www.enigma-recovery.com/ios/buy/\">SmartPhone Recovery PRO</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"c0099362-700c-4336-be98-d66c7f311c78","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1296","url":"/best-iphone-data-recovery-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-09-05T18:44:01Z","datePublished":"2016-11-09T20:53:15Z","name":"Best iPhone Data Recovery Software","synopsis":"When you're frantic because your photos and iPhone data might be lost, a robust recovery tool can find backups and restore your files.","review":{},"strapline":"When you're frantic because your photos and iPhone data might be lost, a robust recovery tool can find backups and restore your files.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-11-09T20:53:15Z","id":"9MK3QQR23u5DbjeA9eRUHD","meta":{"title":"The Best iPhone Data Recovery Software","description":"Looking for the best and cheapest iPhone data recovery software?
