The 501BN is among the few switchers that supports an audio return channel. This is important if you want to send an audio signal from your TV to external speakers without using extra cables. Of course, you need to make sure that your HDMI cables, TV and speakers support an audio return channel as well.","The 501BN comes with a remote that uses infrared to communicate.
