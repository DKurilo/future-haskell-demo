The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/computers/desktops/best-home-computers/\">Home Computers</a> here.</em>","If you or your family members love to surf the internet, watch videos online and run multiple programs at once but hate lag, the ASUS M32AD is a capable home computer that can multitask like a pro. It has the most memory of any computer we reviewed and storage for your important files. With its warranty options, powerful processor and everything in between, this computer is great for active users or big families.","The ASUS M32AD is one of the best home computers in our review thanks to its fourth generation i5-4460 processor. With this processor, you likely won’t ever have problems with slow down. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 740 graphics card creates a clean, clear picture while watching videos or playing games, without concerns of lagging, jittering or similar errors.","As is the case with most of the other Windows computers we reviewed, this computer has 1TB of built-in storage. With 12GB of memory, the M32AD is more than capable of handling average tasks like typing a word document, browsing websites or watching streamed video. It also has a memory card reader, so you can easily access and view media from a digital camera.","The desktop PC has plenty of ports you can use to connect your favorite devices. With three USB 2.0 ports and two USB 3.0 ports, you can connect old devices as well as new ones. You can also connect a monitor via VGA or HDMI. It is not Wi-Fi enabled, so you have to rely on an Ethernet connection for internet access.","The M32AD comes stock with Windows 10 and includes antivirus and Microsoft Office trials. It measures 16 inches tall, 6.9 inches wide and 15 inches long, and it weighs 18 pounds.","ASUS’ customer service received a C-plus when evaluated by our sister site Laptop Mag. Laptop arrived at this score through undercover testing in 2015. Testers looked for efficient and helpful phone, web and social support. According to that evaluation, ASUS’ customer service reps were moderately helpful in answering various questions, and they didn’t try to sell additional products. The company also offers support via live chat if you prefer that method.","The computer is backed by a one-year warranty, and for an additional cost, you have the option to extend your warranty to up to three years. Unlike some other manufacturers, ASUS does not have a community user forum where you can connect with other ASUS users to find answers to questions."]},"id":"c7be896a-afd6-4740-9d2c-9d078c595483","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c3a8c7fa-565c-43f4-ac10-ee2d2222898c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though its only has a fourth generation processor instead of a new sixth generation model, the ASUS M32AD still packs a lot of power and works well for multitasking.
