You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Microsoft Surface Pro is the best detachable in our comparison. With its solid processor, a beautiful high-definition display and a detachable design that adapts to your needs in the workplace, it’s a smart choice whether you’re at your desk all day or out and about. However, it doesn’t have much memory or many ports. Furthermore, the price is just for the <a href=\"/best-home-computers\">computer</a> itself – if you want the Surface Pro Signature Type Cover or the Surface Pen, you’ll have to purchase them separately, which puts the total well over $1,200 with the i5 model in our comparison, or over $2,900 if you opt for the premium i7 model.","This particular detachable computer has a decent processor – a seventh-generation Intel Core i5-7300U 2.6GHz – though you have the option to upgrade to as high as an Intel Core i7 if you need. You can easily watch videos or view photos on the computer thanks to the integrated Intel HD Graphics 620. However, between the mid-grade processor and underwhelming 4GB RAM, you may not be able to heavily multitask without seeing some slowdown or reduction in performance. Again, you have the option to upgrade to as much as 16GB, in which case you can multitask to your heart’s content.","If you know you’ll need to store a lot of files, however, this detachable laptop isn’t your best bet. Like the <a href=\"http://staging.toptenreviews.com/computers/desktops/best-home-computers/dell-review/?status=InProgress\">Dell XPS 13</a>, it only has 128GB of storage, albeit on a solid-state drive. There is no option for a built-in HDD, though you can upgrade to as much as 1TB of SSD if your wallet can spare the hefty extra cost.","With just one USB port, a Mini DisplayPort and a microSD slot, you are extremely limited in the ability to connect peripherals or additional displays. It does have Bluetooth 4.1, but that doesn’t fully make up for having a single USB port, especially since it’s not even USB-C.","The Surface Pro comes stock with Windows 10 Pro 64-bit so you can hit the ground running. The computer by itself measures 11.5 x 7.9 x 0.33 inches and weighs 1.7 pounds, so it’s highly portable and won’t weigh down your messenger bag. It ships with a one-year warranty from the manufacturer. If you have a question about the detachable, or simply wish to learn more about it, you can peruse the arsenal of informational resources on Microsoft’s website, engage in the community user forums or contact customer service directly.","The Microsoft Surface Pro isn’t the best option for demanding users or those needing to regularly store lots of files. However, its versatile design, gorgeous display and decent processor are enough for most business users, and it works in a variety of environments. Backed by great customer service and a one-year warranty, this is a good unit overall, despite its increased price point once you add on all the accessories needed to get the full Surface Pro experience."]},"id":"5535df7b-5cfb-4cb4-b820-3bca6af7081d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69675","url":"/microsoft-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-10-24T16:51:04Z","datePublished":"2017-10-24T16:51:04Z","name":"Microsoft Surface Pro","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":23,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-10-24T16:51:04Z","id":"NoKuDUh4t2QYnc3huiRtTY","meta":{"title":"Microsoft Surface Pro Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Microsoft Surface Pro combines a laptop and tablet, making it a powerful tool for all types of businesses."},"products":[{"slug":"microsoft-surface-pro","url":"/product/microsoft-surface-pro","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:05:16Z","name":"Microsoft Surface Pro","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:05:16Z","id":"Vay3kfcjNcwT4SBopxddWm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:05:16Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/woivKEGmM8uVSiYTQh7e28.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:05:16Z","mimeType":"","name":"1915dc1a622e79a7ba161ac6724d2ce7.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/1915dc1a622e79a7ba161ac6724d2ce7.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:05:16Z","id":"woivKEGmM8uVSiYTQh7e28","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/woivKEGmM8uVSiYTQh7e28.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Microsoft Surface Pro Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Microsoft Surface Pro combines a laptop and tablet, making it a powerful tool for all types of businesses."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/woivKEGmM8uVSiYTQh7e28.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:05:16Z","mimeType":"","name":"1915dc1a622e79a7ba161ac6724d2ce7.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/1915dc1a622e79a7ba161ac6724d2ce7.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:05:16Z","id":"woivKEGmM8uVSiYTQh7e28","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/woivKEGmM8uVSiYTQh7e28.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Microsoft Surface Pro Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Microsoft Surface Pro combines a laptop and tablet, making it a powerful tool for all types of businesses."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/computers/desktops/best-home-computers/microsoft-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:05:16Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:05:16Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"computers","url":"/electronics/computers","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:05:16Z","name":"Computers","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:05:16Z","id":"o7A3TAPY7RTrVES9Lb9iRS","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
