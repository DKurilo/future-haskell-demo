This means that the color of objects in this light will appear almost the same as they would in daylight. With 100 being natural sunny conditions, the Definity LED scores 85.

That&#39;s more than 45 years if you use these LED lights for three hours per day. This is twice the lifespan of most of the LED light bulbs we reviewed. In order to stay within the parameters of usage, you must keep the bulb from reaching high temperatures. The light-emitting diodes in the bulb don&#39;t last as long if they become overheated. For this reason, you can&#39;t use the Definity LED lights in fully enclosed fixtures. You&#39;ll also want to make sure the temperature around the bulb is between -4 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit. The bulb can withstand humidity, but do not expose the LED lamp directly to water.","The FCC has approved this light, and it is UL Listed.
