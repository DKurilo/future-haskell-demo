You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you have ever wanted to know more about what your kids do online on their smartphones, eBlaster Mobile will be able to help. This <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-parental-control-software\">parental control app</a> can help you filter out what they see in the first place and help you track what they have accessed after the fact.","eBlaster&#39;s blocking features are quite advanced. You will be able to block websites from being accessed on their smartphones according to your preferences. You can look through 150 categories of content – including alcohol, tobacco, nudity and more – and designate the ones you do not want your child to access.","This mobile phone safety software will help you keep a virtual eye on your kids with its GPS tracking features. You will be able to make sure your children are where they say they are. The software is hidden on the phone, making it very difficult to disable this feature or any others. That will make it tamper-proof for your kids and anyone who tries to steal the phone.","Unfortunately, eBlaster Mobile lacks a variety of features, including several privacy features. This software cannot wipe or lock the phone from a remote location. You cannot block any numbers from calling or sending text messages to the phone either. Additionally, the cell phone parental controls do not include the ability to set daily use time limits, which would allow the child to only use the phone at approved times during the day.","eBlaster Mobile&#39;s logging capabilities are fairly basic. You can view all calls dialed and received on the phone, along with the duration of each call and the time each call was made. You also receive text message logs that show exact copies of all text messages sent to and from the device. This activity log allows you to see exactly whom your child is talking to and whether the conversations are appropriate. You can also see copies of all emails sent and received by the smartphone.","Unfortunately, this parental control for cell phones app is missing several useful logging capabilities. You cannot view any calendar events or memos entered into the phone. You cannot view any photos captured or stored on the device either.","Without all the advanced features that you&#39;ll find in most similar parental control apps, eBlaster Mobile is at least simple to use. To install the software, you must purchase and download it directly from the eBlaster Mobile website. We are disappointed that this cell phone parental control software is not compatible with many mobile operating systems, and we recommend checking to ensure that your phone is compatible with this software, even if you use a BlackBerry or Android device.","You can obtain assistance with eBlaster Mobile by telephone and live chat if you need to talk with a customer representative. Both phone and live chat support provide you with immediate responses. There is also an adequate FAQs section on the company&#39;s website. These frequently asked questions are directed more towards the software installation process and the stealth options than they are toward the software&#39;s available features and logging capabilities."]},"id":"52001ce8-efbd-4f3b-9736-e7a4e9d292b7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"33ed7cc7-6aa9-4309-981e-43931895cc73","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The eBlaster Mobile application provides you with the features you need to keep an eye on your children without monitoring every activity they perform on their smartphones.
