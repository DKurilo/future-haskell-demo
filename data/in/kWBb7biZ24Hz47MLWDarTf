It works the way most online video game rental stores do: You choose a membership plan, choose the games you want to try and receive one at a time in the mail. Once you’re done playing it, you mail it back to get the next one on your list.","GetGaming offers a huge selection of video games that you never have to pay a late fee for. So you can keep a game as long as it takes you to beat the final boss and drop it in the mail in a prepaid envelope whenever it’s convenient for you. Also, if you rent a game that you love, you can keep it – just pay a discounted price for the disc and you can continue receiving games by mail.","You can rent one game at a time for a low monthly fee, or choose to receive two games at a time if you finish games quickly. You can cancel your GetGaming membership anytime.","You can browse games by console first, and then you can sort the games by title, release date, ESRB rating (age recommendations) or by user rating. In addition to user ratings, you can read reviews if a member has posted one. If you know the game you want to play, you can search for it in the bar at the top of the page.","GetGaming includes titles for the latest consoles, like Xbox One and PlayStation 4, but it also has games for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. You can rent games for Nintendo’s Wii and Wii U, plus games for handheld gaming systems like the PS Vita, 3DS, DS and PSP. The service even rents out games for the PlayStation 2.","GetGaming offers its members a few perks that help offset some of the cost of a membership. For example, it helps you celebrate your birthday by offering you seven days of gaming for free. Also, if you refer a friend and it leads to a new membership, you get 10 free days of gaming.","There’s a comprehensive FAQs section that answers questions such as what to do when a game doesn’t work and how long it takes to get a game by mail. If you can’t find what you’re looking for in GetGaming’s FAQs or its explanation of how membership works, you can email customer support.","GetGaming lets Australian residents rent one to two games per month at a low monthly price. The online video game rental service also offers rent-to-own options and perks for its members."]},"id":"e0667cab-b444-4cda-872a-35fa09b4badc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68659","url":"/getgaming-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-31T17:05:09Z","datePublished":"2016-10-31T17:05:09Z","name":"GetGaming","synopsis":"If you’re living in Australia, your online video game rental options are limited, but GetGaming provides thousands of titles for several consoles.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"If you’re living in Australia, your online video game rental options are limited, but GetGaming provides thousands of titles for several consoles.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-31T17:08:25Z","id":"kWBb7biZ24Hz47MLWDarTf","meta":{"title":"GetGaming Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"GetGaming is an online video game rental store that offers rentals, games for purchase and rent-to-own options to Australian residents.
