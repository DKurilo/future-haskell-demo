When it comes to stick vacuums, we have spent more than 100 hours testing these particular products for more than three years. We first research a wide range of products within a category, looking at a number of important characteristics, different brands and price ranges to get a strong sense of what is available, and what would serve consumers best. After that, we narrow the field by scoring them using a proprietary system that helps determine which products to include in our final list. This system helps us narrow our picks down to the best on the market.","We also interview those with expertise in the field to learn about what people are looking for, and what makes a quality stick vacuum cleaner.","Caitlin Wagner, Product Manager for upright vacuums at Shark, works to develop upright models, but says stick vacuum cleaners definitely have their place. She has one in her home.","&#34;Deep cleaning is for uprights. Quick cleaning is for sticks,&#34; Wagner said.","Keith Quimby is a Utah-based vacuum dealer and repairman with more than 30 years of experience. He agrees that stick vacs have their place – mostly on hard flooring for quick pick-ups. He said even some of the less expensive ones work well, but they don&#39;t last long, they tend to get clogged, and the brushes wear out quickly. They can also seem pretty heavy if you use them for very long.","&#34;Most of these are for a quick pick-up,&#34; Quimby said.","The folks at Dyson would like to change that perception. With the release of the V10, they are hoping people can start to use their stick vacuum as their only vacuum. Josh Mutlow, Senior Design Engineer at Dyson, said as people start to do more of what he calls ‘reactive cleaning” throughout the week – more often, but for less time – they won&#39;t need to do a long vacuuming session on the weekends. He said the increased run time, suction and bin capacity on the latest Dysons should get you through some pretty long cleaning sessions, too, though, if you need them.","&#34;We as a company definitely believe the cord-free machines transform the way you clean, and change your habits, so much that the conventional full-sized machines are now sort of obsolete,&#34; Mutlow said.","Mutlow said they have worked hard to remove some of the reasons traditional stick vacuums have not replaced full-sized vacuum cleaners already – they can seem heavy after a while, and the battery inevitably degrades over time. They&#39;ve been working to distribute the weight in the best possible way and engineer the battery to last.","All of that progress comes at a cost. Some of the latest stick vac models from Dyson cost $600. There are still lots of stick vacs available in many different price ranges, though, and we looked at some lower cost models as well, for those still seeking just an inexpensive second vacuum. We tested those costing $60 to $500. The most expensive stick vacuum really was the best for suction, but we also found a few that were almost as good and cost dramatically less. Our top three did a great job of cleaning and cost right around $100.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","To conduct our tests, we spread a reasonably heavy amount of sawdust on several square feet of hardwood flooring and carpeting in our testing lab, and started vacuuming. The ones that cleaned the sawdust in the fewest passes scored the best.","We also discovered that consumers who buy stick vacuums are pet owners who want these machines to quickly clear away pet hair without having to haul out a big, heavy upright vacuum cleaner to do deep cleaning. So, we worked pet hair into our carpeting sample after the sawdust tests were complete, and tested each stick vacuum on embedded pet hair removal.","We took note of how many passes it took to completely clean an area and scored each machine accordingly. We also tested the charging time and battery life of battery-powered stick vacuums.","In addition, we noted how low each machine could go to get under furniture such as couches or beds. We also noted how the machine felt and moved as we used it to clean.","<strong>Things to Look For in a Stick Vacuum</strong>","Most stick vacuums aren&#39;t designed to do deep cleaning, but are one solution when you need to clean up spilled cereal, a thin layer of dust or some pet hair in the carpet that gives your otherwise attractive room a slightly scruffy look. These qualities are great to have:","Design<br/>Stick vacuums are meant to be simple, but some are more versatile. It&#39;s great to get one with strong suction that is still lightweight so you can whip it out, quickly clean and put it away easily. You undoubtedly want a stick vacuum that is easy to maneuver, and can go into tight spots and corners. It&#39;s great if you get one that can be lowered as flat as possible to reach under furniture. If storage space is at a premium, look for one with a handle that folds or collapses so it takes up less space.","Cleanup &amp; Filters<br/>Most stick vacuums come with a removable bin that collects the dust and debris on your floors. You simply detach and empty it, and it&#39;s always helpful to get a vacuum with a big dust bin so you don&#39;t have to empty it frequently. If anyone in your house has allergies, a HEPA-certified vacuum will give you filters that clear the air of 99.9 percent of allergens, which can be a great relief.","Attachments &amp; Tools<br/>Little extras can make a huge difference. A crevice tool and a dusting brush are excellent for cleaning furniture, and some stick vacuums come with a detachable handheld vacuum that you can use to clean tight spots like between the banister railings on your stairway."]},"id":"40166ff7-31a8-4134-8b42-14f564e3815d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"8610ae1e-eedc-4171-9ad1-d0ed99e967c6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/hoover-linx-review\">Hoover LiNX</a>","<a href=\"/black-decker-review\">Black &amp; Decker Lithium Ion Stick</a>","<a href=\"/hoover-review\">Hoover Cyclonic Corded Bagless</a>","<a href=\"/dyson-cyclone-v10-review\">Cyclone V10 Absolute Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner</a>","<a href=\"/shark-review\">Shark Navigator</a>","<a href=\"/dyson-review\">Dyson V6 Animal Cord-Free Stick Vacuum -
