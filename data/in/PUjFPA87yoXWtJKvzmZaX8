The service uses high-tech equipment and talent to scan your media. Your photographs are scanned into uncompressed TIFF files, which results in the highest quality possible.","The turnaround time for DigMyPics’ scanning services varies depending on the number of photographs you have. For fewer than 400 photos, expect to have your order back in under six days. If you have more than 2,401 photographs to scan, though, it may take 15 or more business days to process and return your order.","If you don’t want to have to wait as long for this photo scanning company to process your order, an additional fee places a rush on the service. Expect to pay about a 50 percent premium with a minimum amount, though.","Standard prints are scanned at 300 dots per inch (dpi), a standard that balances print quality and size. While DigMyPics organizes your photographs for you, small groups containing 30 or fewer photos incur an additional charge per group. You can give a name to each group of photos you send in, and the resulting images are placed into separate folders named accordingly.","Manual color and exposure correction is standard practice with DigMyPics’ photo scanning services. Professional photo technicians run each image through Adobe Photoshop to make sure they look acceptable. If you have a large collection of photographs that need correction, it can increase the processing time for your order.","If you own VHS, VHS-C, 8mm or Digital 8 home video cassettes or film, DigMyPics has the ability to convert and transfer them to long-lasting DVD discs. This scanning service uses professional series JVC decks for this process, which results in noise reduction and video stabilization in the finished video. It only supports NTSC formatted tapes, though, so it can’t transfer any PAL formats.","Broken videocassette tapes aren’t a problem for DigMyPics. The photo scanning service can attempt to repair broken tapes for an added fee. However, if the tape can’t be fixed, the repair fee still applies.","DigMyPics is a good option if you’re looking for a professional photo scanning service. Be prepared for extra fees for things like repair and rush orders, though. As well as still images, this photo scanning company can also convert a variety of films to digital media and employ noise-reduction techniques to improve quality."]},"id":"96dd4fb3-7fca-4a14-a6c6-a7aa0f12bd3b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64756","url":"/digmypics-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-12T15:39:26Z","datePublished":"2015-05-12T15:39:26Z","name":"DigMyPics","synopsis":"DigMyPics offers photo scanning services with professional videographers and photographers overseeing the process.
