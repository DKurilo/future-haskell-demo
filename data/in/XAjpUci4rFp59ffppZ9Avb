Depending on what you are grilling, the app alerts you when your meat has finished cooking according to the doneness level you set. In our case, we grilled four steaks without any problems, but when we grilled a pork chop, the suggested setting of 160 degrees was a little overdone to our liking. The app is simple to navigate, and pairing the iGrill Mini to an iPhone and iPad is easy.

Instead, it relies on your smartphone or tablet’s screen. This is a potential drawback for some consumers since there’s always a risk of getting your smartphone covered in BBQ juices. To compensate for this, to a degree, Weber included a thin, circular LED indicator that rests on top of the thermometer. The light goes from green to yellow, orange and finally red when the thermometer reaches the target temperature.
