While it lacks the two-way, long-range remotes of more expensive car alarms, it still has a warn-away feature, a six-stage 120-dB siren, a fault-proof starter interrupt and two auxiliary ports for adding keyless entry or other sensors. Overall, the Avital 3100LX is one of the most popular and highly rated car alarms on the market, and since it costs less than $30, it&#39;s a good value purchase.","Despite being one of the most affordable ways of protecting your car (short of simply purchasing car alarm decals to put on the windows), the Avital 3100LX comes with security features arguably just as effective as the $200 <a href=\"/viper-5706v-review\">Viper 5706V</a> and <a href=\"/python-car-alarm-review\">Python 5706P</a> car alarms. All of these alarms are made by the same company, Directed, Inc. and each feature a six-stage, 120-dB siren and a dual-stage shock sensor. If the purpose of an alarm is to deter potential thieves with a loud siren, then there&#39;s no difference in the performance of these alarms. The difference lies in the quality of the remote, expansion potential and convenience features, like a remote start system.","The 3100LX has a starter interrupt, a common feature with alarms manufactured by Directed, Inc. This feature makes it difficult for thieves to hotwire the engine. So even if the baddie is not deterred by the blaring alarm, they may not be able to start the engine. It&#39;s not impossible to get around, as professional car thieves have proven, but at the very least, it&#39;s a hassle.","This car alarm comes with two remotes with a range of 1,500 feet. The remote arms and disarms the alarm, but you can also unlock doors and open the trunk (but only if you&#39;ve added these optional features). The downside to the remotes, and a reason for the affordability of this car alarm, is the one-way transmission. The remote transmits a signal to the car alarm, but not vice versa. This means you aren&#39;t alerted, via the remote, when an alarm goes off. So, every time you hear a car alarm, you have to investigate whether it&#39;s your car or someone else&#39;s.","On a positive note, the Avital 3100LX security system provides the convenience of keyless entry and trunk release. Both features are common in contemporary vehicles, but this is a great way of adding this convenience to an older vehicle.","It also features a panic button, also known as a car finder. When you press the button, the car&#39;s horn beeps and the headlights flash, making it easy for you to find your car in a parking lot.","You don&#39;t have to spend hundreds to protect your car. While the Avital 3100LX may be simple, it provides excellent security with a Zone-2 impact sensor, a fault-proof starter interrupt and a loud alarm. Though optional, you can add convenience features, like keyless entry and trunk release."]},"id":"f8543118-bb98-44aa-a5ba-d1d7c569c796","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51014","url":"/avital-car-alarm-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-08T14:36:56Z","datePublished":"2010-10-08T14:36:56Z","name":"Avital 3100LX","synopsis":"There are a lot of cheap car alarms on the market, but the Avital 3100LX is one of the best.","review":{"rating":53,"verdict":"The Avital 3100LX is simple and affordable car alarm.
