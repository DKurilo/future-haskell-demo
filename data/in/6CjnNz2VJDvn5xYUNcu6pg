You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you need an easy-to-use picture editor, but still want to be able to get good results, then ArcSoft PhotoStudio 6 is worth looking at. At first glance, this <a href=\"/best-mac-photo-editing-software\">Mac photo editing software</a> has all of the same basic editing tools and automatic options found in most photo editing software, but it does contain a few special tricks that will help speed up your workflow.","Editing can be scary at first, but fortunately, PhotoStudio 6 doesn&#39;t assault you with unnecessary tools and features. This lets you get to the heart of photo editing quicker, and allows you to accomplish your tasks with ease. There are many automatic functions in this image editor  for applying general adjustments to your pictures, such as brightness and contrast, color saturation, and image resizing and rotation.","You can also work with layers, which lets you edit in a non-destructive environment that preserves your original image. This picture editor contains several filters are easy to use and allow enough manual control to make both pro-level and casual users happy.","Among the more interesting tools and features is an excellent de-noise option, which is used to get rid of the artifacts and grainy imperfections found in photos taken at high ISOs. You can also use the Magic Cut tool to cut out subjects in a photo and drop them into new backgrounds and locations. Face Beauty can reduce a subject’s blemishes, wrinkles, red eye and more, and there are plenty of creative filters you can apply to change the tone of images.","The Magic-Film and Toy Camera filters allow you to take your photos and give them a unique look. Magic-Film has extensive manual controls and settings for replicating 35 mm film types, while Toy Camera can duplicate the analogue look of a Lomographic camera.","Magic Cut is a fun tool that cuts a subject out of an image and then allows you to drop the subject into another background. This software also supports HDR editing for adjusting light contrast to improve image clarity. You can also crop pictures, adjust the exposure, change or enhance colors and more.","A familiar user interface combined with an expansive feature set greets you when you first open the PhotoStudio 6 Mac photo editing software. More advanced users will enjoy working with the full manual controls with their photos, while casual users and hobbyists will appreciate many of the other easy-to-use features.","This image editor includes a built-in browser, which you can use to scan through and organize photos. It will help you keep track of images with tags and ratings, and the calendar view helps keep track of photos by both their imported and created dates. This is a great feature for sorting your photos.","This software supports large image sizes, which is great, as more and more consumer point-and-shoot cameras and professional DSLRs have higher megapixel counts. However, not many digital cameras come close to PhotoStudio 6&#39;s maximum supported size of 30,000 x 30,000 pixels.","Unfortunately, there aren’t any options to share photos via email or directly on the web. It would be nice to see a function that lets you upload directly to Flickr or Facebook, although once photos are saved in the browser, it shouldn’t be a problem to simply email, print or upload them to whichever website you prefer.","PhotoStudio 6 can save in most common formats, including JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP and others. There is also a format native only to the software.","Help and support options for this Mac photo editing software app include a user manual, tutorials, a FAQs section, product knowledgebase pages and user forums to interact with other users. Technical support is available via email or telephone."]},"id":"56eb1cc4-f9c9-4c03-9efa-78535c5caac3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"00dda40f-3793-47a9-bb34-ed5ddfd5354c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ArcSoft PhotoStudio 6 is a good Mac photo editing software app that can handle just about any type of photo project you can conceive of.
