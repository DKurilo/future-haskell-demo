The company&#39;s lapboards aren&#39;t the best option for the office, unless your work environment is spectacularly relaxed, but the standard desktop keyboards work well in any setting. However, if you work from home and position yourself at a distance from your monitor, then a Razer lapboard is a solid option. Similarly, gamers can make use of this wireless lapboard, obliterating opponents on their consoles or PCs from the comfort of the sofa.","Razer wireless keyboards come with dual wireless connectivity. If you want to play on your console, you can connect the keyboard and a mouse via Bluetooth LE. Alternatively, if you&#39;re out to pound some enemies on your PC, you can simply connect the 2.4GHz radio frequency USB adaptor, and you&#39;re ready to play. Because all the hardware on and in these devices is gaming grade, you&#39;ll experience a solid, uninterrupted wireless or RF connection that&#39;s lag-free. The keyboards have an audio out and mic in port, and some models also have a USB pass-through, so you can connect any peripheral you need directly to the keyboard.","Razer makes wireless models that have ultra-low-profile chicklet-style keys with scissor switches. Even though the keys are very slim, the scissor switches provide the tactile response that&#39;s important to gamers and touch-typists alike.","Razer lapboards are built to be portable for wireless gaming, so they are compact and don’t have special keys like media keys or dedicated hotkeys. However, you can program macros to each function key, then save game-specific macros to any of the five gaming profiles.","These lapboards don&#39;t have 10-key number pads. The space normally reserved for a number pad is taken up by a magnetic mouse pad. Because the lapboards are portable and compact, the keys are particularly close. Full-size models with mechanical or mechanical-like keys do have special keys and a number pad, and they have large keys with ample space between each one.","Keyboards and lapboards from Razer aren&#39;t truly ergonomic, but some have ultra-slim designs and fit comfortably on your lap. For those times when you need to do some serious but precise button-mashing and combo-making, the company makes its boards with solid anti-ghosting technology – the keyboards and lapboards can register up to 10 simultaneous keystrokes accurately. When connected to Bluetooth LE, the polling rate is 125Hz, and when you use the RF USB adapter, it is 500Hz.","While Razer’s lapboards don&#39;t compare to full-size mechanical gaming keyboards, they are robust enough for casual sofa gaming or working. Razer is a well-respected computing peripheral brand, and its compact and full-size boards boast solid build quality and a consistent gaming experience."]},"id":"5417952a-e141-4d49-a0a8-a603dfb5bd44","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68433","url":"/razer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-21T18:24:12Z","datePublished":"2016-09-21T18:24:12Z","name":"Razer Turret","synopsis":"While Razer wireless keyboards are built for gaming, they work equally well for other applications, particularly for power users performing demanding tasks.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"While Razer wireless keyboards are built for gaming, they work equally well for other applications, particularly for power users performing demanding tasks.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-21T18:24:12Z","id":"Zpd2W4DamshbD8w2AzzK7c","meta":{"title":"Razer Turret Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Razer wireless lapboards combine comfort, lag-free wireless connections and anti-ghosting technology for a powerful gaming setup.
