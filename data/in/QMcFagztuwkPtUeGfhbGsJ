It is also safe to use because you can deep fry foods with the lid closed. We fried fresh-cut potatoes and breaded chicken strips, and it took little effort or know-how. The food turned out nice, and our taste testing panel gave the Hamilton Beach’s French fries and breaded chicken strips above-average ratings.","When we tested it, this fryer took 15 minutes to come to temperature, which is a bit longer than average. However, after we put the food in it, it heated the oil back to the required temperature quickly, taking just two and a half minutes – that’s the second-fastest heat recovery time of the fryers we tested. The container holds 1.9 liters (about 8 cups) of oil and cooks just over 3 pounds of food per batch, which is quite a bit for a countertop deep fryer.","This 1,500-watt deep fryer is easy to use: After assembling it, we just poured in oil to the fill line and set the temperature. An indicator light lets you know the fryer is on, and another tells you when it&#39;s ready. However, this model doesn’t have a timer, a feature that is helpful to have when cooking.","This fryer lacks some convenience features that would make cleanup less of a hassle. For example, it doesn&#39;t have any oil filtration, drainage or storage features. When we poured the oil out of the fryer, it created a mess. The inner container is dishwasher-safe, but you need to thoroughly wipe down the lid and element after each use. If you want a high-performing deep fryer that is relatively easy to clean, take a look at the <a href=\"/krups-review\">KRUPS KJ502D51</a>.","Still, the Hamilton Beach includes some welcome features that enhance safety. For example, you can raise or lower the basket while the lid is on, which is when deep fryers splatter the most. In addition, the cord attaches to the fryer with a magnet, so you can cut power quickly in the event of an emergency. The fryer is also quite stable on its base thanks to its design and non-skid feet. The plastic exterior maintains a moderate temperature – the maximum we recorded was 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Hamilton Beach guarantees this fryer to be free from defects for one year."]},"id":"2a31fc8f-404f-4ce9-b253-b2519b3f92a8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67440","url":"/hamilton-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-11-19T16:16:04Z","datePublished":"2015-11-19T16:16:04Z","name":"Hamilton Beach 35021","synopsis":"The affordable Hamilton Beach Immersion Heater 35021 is a home deep fryer that is sturdy and easy to use, and it cooks a lot of food at once.
