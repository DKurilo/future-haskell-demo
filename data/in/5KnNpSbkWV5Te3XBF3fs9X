You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","While the MiCash MasterCard isn&#39;t great as far as reasonably priced <a href=\"/best-prepaid-credit-cards\">prepaid credit cards</a> are concerned, but there are options that can make it a good choice under different circumstances. This card comes with a few rewards and perks that can give you incentive to use it such as a direct deposit perk and getting money for referring your friends.","The small activation fee of $4.95 comes after the first load of cash onto the card. This is great compared to other cards and companies. And if that almost $5 seems a little steep, just know that every time you get a friend to sign up and put money on a MiCash Mastercard, you will get $30 loaded onto your card. There is a limit to the number of persons you can get reimbursed for referring but this is a great perk nonetheless. There is a monthly maintenance fee of $4.00 which is small compared to other prepaid credit cards. You also get an automatic $25 when you sign up for the prepaid credit card&#39;s direct deposit. The only problem will be the fees you encounter when working with ATMs.","On another note, several other common fees are less with MiCash than are charged by most competitors. The fee for not using the account in a 60-day period is $2.00 per month. Cash withdrawals from an ATM cost $2.50 each time you withdraw money. ATM withdrawal attempts, which are declined, incur a charge of $ .60 as do declined purchase attempts. Balance inquiries at an ATM are charged $.95 and funds can be shared between MiCash MasterCard accounts free. A lost or stolen card costs $10.00 to replace.","You can make up to $2,000 in purchases, daily, using the MiCash MasterCard, limited, of course, by the available balance on the card. Cash withdrawals of up to $500 per day are also available.","If you have family or friends that are in need of financial help, you can send them money using the MiCash MasterCard. This is a particularly valuable service for sending money to family or friends in foreign countries where banking transfers can be difficult to set up. Each transfer costs $.95. At the user&#39;s option, money can be sent to a location where cash can be received, to a recipient’s bank account or in some locations, directly to the recipient&#39;s home. Transferred funds are generally available within minutes pending identity validation. Money transfers can also be made to a companion card in another country though this is often less practical, as many other countries don’t accept the ubiquitous plastic as is common in the U.S.","The daily limit for deposits to this prepaid credit card is $2,000 a day, but there is no charge to do so. Daily cash deposits of up to $2,500 can be made via Western Union or Green Dot agents. These agents will charge a fee for the service. Money can also be transferred to the card from accounts at financial institutions.","Calls to a live customer service representative at MiCash cost $1.00 per minutes, which we don&#39;t really understand. The other option is to call the automated and FREE number, which might be more enticing to you. Information on the company’s web site is very informative and they can also be contacted by email. The website is fully functional but a few of the additional portions of the site are still under construction."]},"id":"f64c1a1c-ed81-4f63-995f-8f779e10c551","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8b6aeba1-e0c1-40fb-8ef1-08946b4fcb60","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["MiCash MasterCard isn&#39;t one of the most versatile prepaid credit cards on the market yet it comes with some handy features.
