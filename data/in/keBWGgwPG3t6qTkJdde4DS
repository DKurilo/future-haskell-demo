If you’re new to the program, you should take the time to get to know it before you use it. Burning a new music CD or making a simple data disc won’t take very long to master.

This allows you to password-protect your disc, and you can also add a digital signature to your disc so that future users can verify its origin. This is all great for backing up your most important files and keeping them secure.","The ripping and audio-conversion features with Nero Burning ROM are also highlights.
