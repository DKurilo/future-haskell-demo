The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about train sets here.</em>","Easy-to-use train sets include everything you need to get started as a train hobbyist in one box, and the Bachmann Santa Fe Flyer accomplishes this task. This affordable <a href=\"/best-train-sets\"><u>model train</u></a> allows you to assemble your own track and build your own railroad without having to make multiple purchases.","The Santa Fe Flyer has a unique War Bonnet paint theme. The War Bonnet is named after a headdress worn by Native Americans. Different versions of the design have graced Santa Fe trains for decades, and you will find its yellow and red design on this model train.","This HO-Scale model comes equipped with two freight cars and a caboose. For a reasonable price, this electric train offers an introduction to the model train hobby. The locomotive is built out of sturdy plastic with metal wheels so you can expect it to be reasonably durable. Although children and younger teens appreciate this electric train, adult supervision is required for those using it under the age of 14.","The track is easy to assemble. It features Bachmann&#39;s E-Z Track design, which allows you to easily snap the separate pieces together. The track is relatively short, forming a 36-inch circle, but you can always purchase and add more Bachmann track later. The roadbed is attached to the track, so it is sturdy enough to use without nailing it to a floor or table.","This train set does not have many extras, like sound effects or a smokestack that blows smoke. It also lacks additional scenery accessories like signs, telephone poles or figurines that you will find with other model trains. However, if creating your own railroad and scenery from scratch is appealing, you will like this train set.","This electric train is moderately difficult to assemble. The cars are difficult to get into position on the tracks, so adult assistance is necessary for young assemblers. Bachmann stands by its products with a one-year limited warranty. After the first year, there is a fee for repairs. The website offers a telephone number and email address. An instruction manual is included with your purchase."]},"id":"6f2ea8c9-e349-4f81-b2db-799e9b422d5d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9bbb5425-6224-43f2-8350-c2b6d361a855","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This train lacks accessories and props, but it is a quality train at a reasonable price.
