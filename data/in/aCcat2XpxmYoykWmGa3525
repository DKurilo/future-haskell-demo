Be sure to check out the other <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1274-best-bookshelf-speakers.html\">bookshelf speakers</a>.</strong>","The <strong>Infinity Primus P152</strong> <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1274-best-bookshelf-speakers.html\">bookshelf speaker</a> shares a lot of characteristics with its only slightly bigger brother, the Infinity Primus P162, which ranks as one of our very favorite entries in this bookshelf speaker lineup. The design similarities are obvious from the single low-frequency driver and tweeter placement right down to the front-firing bass-reflex port. And though the P152 is a pleasant little bookshelf loudspeaker, its performance falls far shorter of the mark set by the P162 than its looks might imply.","The Infinity Primus P152 bookshelf speaker does everything very well, to a point. Unfortunately, that point is pretty easy to reach and exceed, especially when used as stereo music speakers or the main front speakers in a home theater system. On the other hand, as surround sound speakers, they can be ideal.","Bass response is among the best among the lower half of our top ten favorite entry-level bookshelf speakers. Indeed, it compares favorably with several products in the top half of our bookshelf speaker survey. Our complaint is that the bass can rather easily overwhelm the speakers when they’re driven even moderately hard. Bass that’s tight and deep at low volume levels becomes imprecise and muddy with a bit more input. Mid-range frequencies, where most musical content resides, fares better but still loses its clarity and definition at even moderately high levels. The highest frequencies remain comparatively consistent even at higher volumes which makes sense given that the same tweeter is employed as with the superior P162.","Sensitivity, or efficiency, is a rather disappointing 88dB, placing it near the bottom end of the specifications of the bookshelf speakers that we’ve included in our evaluations. This is a particularly important measurement because it relates to how well the speakers interact with the amplifier or receiver that is driving them. More efficient speakers allow the components that are providing the input to operate at nearer their optimal performance level providing clearer and consistently more accurate sound.","The manufacturer recommends a minimum 10W of input power to drive the Infinity Primus P152. Maximum recommended input is just 100W, a rather low figure which we believe to be reflective of the relative ease of overdriving the units. The speakers are magnetically shielded so they’re not likely to interfere with the video performance of a CRT television or monitor if placed nearby. That isn’t an issue for flat-screen TVs. Gold-plated, five-way binding posts are provided for great cable connections regardless of the method used.","We believe that the relatively small, 5 1/4-inch low-frequency driver is a limiting factor in the overall performance of these bookshelf speakers. We have no quarrel with its quality. After all, it features the same Metal Matrix Diaphragm, MMD, that’s used in the highly-rated P162. MMD has a rigid aluminum core that reacts very quickly and accurately when compared to many other competing materials. The diminutive size of the driver, however, seems at issue. Ultimately, when reproducing sound, the driver’s ability to move air is paramount. We also think it’s possible that the relatively high crossover setting of 3,300Hz may contribute to the mid-range confusion given that so much of the audio content is relegated to the overworked driver. This small cone just doesn’t seem to be quite up to the task at higher levels. The excellent 3/4-inch MMD dome tweeter produces top-quality sound.","We like the front-firing bass-reflex port that’s part of this bookshelf speaker’s enclosure. It makes this one of rather few bookshelf speakers that really can reasonably be wall-mounted for surround sound applications. The enclosure has an attractive black wood-grain finish.","Infinity provides customer support by telephone or email. The FAQs section applies to Infinity products generally as opposed to this specific bookshelf speaker but it’s thorough enough to be helpful. The owner manual is available on the manufacturer’s website."]},"id":"efbe2986-e71b-4ae6-9643-022874836599","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f424c6f9-e9f0-43ff-9f12-7a77ff21ba0a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Infinity has a well deserved reputation for offering high-quality audio speakers.
