This feature can freshen up your favorite old movies.

Through Viera Connect, you will be able to access apps such as Netflix, YouTube, Skype, Facebook and Twitter, to name a few.","If you want the ease of having all your digital media sources connected, you are going to want a Blu-ray player such as the BDT460 that is DLNA certified. When your Blu-ray and PC or network drive are DLNA certified, it essentially works like cloud storage for all of your digital media. Once you set up this connection, you will have the ability to access your photos, videos and music from anywhere within your network.","If you&#39;re a parent, you know how important it is to keep a watchful eye over your children. With the parental lock feature on the BDT460, you can manage the content your child has access to by setting the ratings on your DVDs and Blu-rays along with password-protecting Viera Connect.","Another feature on the BDT460 is the Miracast (display-mirroring) feature that allows you, with one swipe of your finger, to display what is on your Android smartphone or other Android mobile device onto your television. What is special about Miracast is it allows you to send 1080p-quality video – and it can even play on surround-sound speakers.","One addition that you don’t see on many Blu-ray players is the BDT460’s external HDD Playback.
