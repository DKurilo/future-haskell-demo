You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The LG LW6014ER is one of the more powerful <a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">window air conditioning units</a> on our lineup. This device can cool a room up to 250 square feet and provides a maximum airflow of 200 cubic feet per minute. It features four-way directional airflow, so you can direct the air to where you need and want it. However, this is a large room air conditioning unit, and it is missing many features that you find on similar products, which is why this LG room AC ranks lows on our lineup.","The highlight of this unit is its cooling ability. It features 6,000 British thermal units (BTU). The more BTU a cooling unit provides, the larger amount of space the device can cool. This LG product can cool up to 300 square feet. Furthermore, at 200 cubic feet per minute, the airflow on this product is excellent. It also features four-way directional airflow, so you can direct the air to where you want it and evenly distribute it around the room.","The unit is Energy Star certified, and it has an EER of 11.2. Energy efficient air conditioners have a rating of 10 or greater. In addition, we calculated the estimated annual energy cost for the device running eight hours a day for a three month period. This product has an estimated annual energy cost of $45.79.","The LG LW6014ER has three separate fan speeds, so you can choose to run the fan without the compressor to just circulate air in the room. It also features an energy-saving mode, during which the device only runs when needed. Unfortunately, there is no sleep mode on this device, but it does have a dry mode to remove excess moisture from the air. A dry mode is particularly beneficial if you live in humid climates.","This window AC unit is around the same size as many similar products. It is approximately 13 inches tall, 18 inches wide and 15 inches long. It weighs around 50 pounds, making it just below the average weight of other window air conditioners on our lineup. This size makes it easy to move and store during the winter months.","A one-year warranty is available on this product, which is low compared to some five-year warranties offered on other window air conditioners. However, if you do have any issues or problems with the device, LG customer service has many resources to help you. Email, telephone and live chat support options are available, so you can speak directly with a customer service representative, and a FAQs section and online manuals are available on the company’s website."]},"id":"94a92723-4c91-4007-beea-26c692c9722b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dd1cb305-f39e-4ef5-8454-4082cc7d9a76","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you need a window air conditioner with the ability to cool approximately 250 square feet, the LG LW6014ER can meet your needs.
