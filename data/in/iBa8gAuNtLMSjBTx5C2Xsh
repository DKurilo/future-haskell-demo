It doesn’t have as many accessories as other models and is less focused on teaching the most beginning, basic and universal microscopy topics. This product is beyond the scope of the best kids microscopes. Also, there’s just not enough to play with to keep kids entertained.","The defining feature of this microscope for kids is the inclusion of a digital camera. It&#39;s a great idea, except the camera is not of very high quality. Celestron also includes a zoom eyepiece, top and bottom LED lights and three prepared slides. Apart from the prepared slides, which feature a mosquito head, a cross section of bamboo and the hairs of a silverberry, there are rocks and a honeybee wing for samples.","There are no Petri dishes, slides, stains, scalpels, forceps, test tubes, needles or anything else harmful on this microscope for students. While these items are great for a children&#39;s microscope set, they require an adult’s supervision. That leaves very little inspiration and equipment for children to make their own slides, although it is pretty easy and inexpensive to buy blank slides or more prepared slides.","This scope features a lot of plastic in its construction, making it much better suited to an older student who is not as likely to accidently knock it off of a table. Of course, it&#39;s not designed for a real researcher. The optics would never satisfy a professional, but none of the scopes in our lineup would. This scope would likely be suited to a middle or high school student. This model is not particularly portable, with no carrying case and a lot of breakable plastic parts. We think the youngest explorers would benefit from something sturdier.","One plus in the ease of use column is the multiple light sources. There is LED illumination on both top and bottom. That means you can see a wide variety of specimens, including things like pennies and small rocks.","This kit includes basic instructions and an entire booklet about microscopes, their history and the various types. These materials were not written for the youngest scientists, but they will be informative for students who have already learned basic scientific principles.","This is the only kids microscope we reviewed to include instructional software of any kind. This is much more inspiring for young kids than a colorless instruction booklet.","Customer service from this company is hit and miss, and usually a miss in our experience, at least the telephone support. Our wait time was rather extreme. The company does have an excellent website, though. Celestron also stands behind its products with a two-year warranty."]},"id":"e5bf14b4-7337-4702-9e99-d17b229916bf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"514d6fd7-70d6-4f78-976f-e8bb9e28a111","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The bottom line with Celestron’s Digital Microscope Kit is that it has good optics, though not the best.
