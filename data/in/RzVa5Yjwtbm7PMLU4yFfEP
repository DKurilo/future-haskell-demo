Additionally, we looked for programs that let you use keyboard shortcuts to make changes to your design and checked to see which applications compile shopping lists as you create your plan so you know exactly what you need to bring your vision to life.","<strong><strong>Does it work as advertised?</strong> </strong>","During testing, we created a list of the most important features found in the best landscaping software and looked for them in each application we tested. This list included topography designers, which help you recreate your yard’s unique landscape. We also favored programs that let you edit 3D objects, since they allow you to fine-tune the items you place in your design and preview them as they appear in real life. In addition, a photo importer is a great tool that can help you replicate real-life yards and landscapes you love. Further, a cost estimator feature can give you an idea of how much it will cost to make your dream design a reality.","The three top-scoring programs in our lineup include a seasonal change preview. This allows you to toggle between all four seasons to see what your plan will look like throughout the year. This can help you make more informed choices about what will work for your specific climate, especially if you live in an area that has more pronounced weather differences during the summer and winter months.","Another tool worthy of note is the virtual reality preview. This tool exports a preview of your design into a format that can be used by the Oculus Rift so that you can walk through it as though it was already built. This is great because it can show you any flaws in your design that you might not have noticed in your plans or in previews on your computer screen.","<strong>Does it have a lot of good content? </strong>","We examined each program’s object and plant libraries to see what types of lighting, grills, outdoor furniture and foliage they contain.

We spoke with several landscape designers and contractors, and they cautioned that it is difficult to create a useable outdoor space without professional knowledge. Nearly any landscaping software can give you a good idea of how you want to set up the zones in your yard. However, the professionals we spoke with stressed that it’s much harder to get a good-quality planting design that suits your local climate – in fact, they claimed it is next to impossible to do without the help from a local professional. They also advised checking with local contractors to see if they work with plans made with these applications, since many don&#39;t accept homemade designs.","Additionally, you should check with your municipality to learn about local ordinances. Many cities and counties list certain types of plants that are either required or forbidden – if you violate local ordinances, you risk being cited and having to pay fines. All cities have a code services office you can check with before you start planting or construction.","We have reviewed landscaping software for more than a decade.
