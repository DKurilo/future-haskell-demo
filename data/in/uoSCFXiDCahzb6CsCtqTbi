Though it didn’t have the lowest prices, it was still below average with lower prices than <a href=\"/allstate-review\">Allstate</a>, but more expensive policies than <a href=\"/progressive-review\">Progressive</a>. It offers the most discount options of any insurer, though, and you can also sign up for accident forgiveness.","There’s a lot of different factors that go into determining how much you’ll pay for your auto policy. Some of it is based on the type of car you drive, how long you’ve owned it and whether you own it outright or are making payments. Where you live and your personal driving history also has a big impact on your rates. One factor you might not expect to affect your rate is your credit score. Having only a good score, in the 650-700 range, can increase your premiums by several hundred dollars.","We got quotes for two different cars, one regarded as more expensive to insure and one listed as being low-cost to insure. The estimated quotes for these polices were below the average cost, by a hundred dollars or so. We saw lower costs, but the prices we got were still good.","Two-car policies follow the same trend. The average quote we got was around $970 and our quote for a policy with two cars from Liberty was around $800. One of the costliest increases to a policy is a teenage driver. Adding a young driver can increase your premium by as much as 80%. Our quote for a Liberty Mutual policy with a teenage driver was around $1,200, a few hundred less than our average of $1,400.","Those quotes reflect the industry recommended 100/300/100 coverage limits. Each state has its own legal minimums, usually around 20/65/20, so if you only want basic coverage you can end up paying much less. Liberty had one of the lowest basic policy rates, quoting us $144 while the average for our lineup was $385.","Liberty offers multiple discount options to shave more money off your policy costs. Most of these discounts are standard, such as a discount for having a clean driving record and for student drivers keeping good grades. Liberty offers a discount for driving a hybrid vehicle, which many other insurers didn’t offer.","You can also join Liberty’s RightTrack program. This is similar to programs offered by other insurers. You’ll install a small device to your car that will monitor driving habits like the miles you drive, when you drive and rapid acceleration or braking. After 90 days of monitoring you’ll get a discount on your policy, sometimes up to 90 percent.","Liberty also offers accident forgiveness. This is an additional feature that, for an additional cost, will prevent your policy from increasing after an accident. The small cost for adding accident forgiveness will often offset the dramatic policy increases that occur after an accident."]},"id":"6932a3aa-461f-411b-b58a-26a83863edbc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3501","url":"/liberty-mutual-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-08-04T15:53:48Z","datePublished":"2009-08-04T15:53:48Z","name":"Liberty Mutual Auto Insurance","synopsis":"After comparing quotes, discounts and other features, we settled on Liberty Mutual as our pick for the best overall auto insurance company.","review":{"rating":90,"verdict":"With lower-than average policy rates and a wide range of discounts and other features, Liberty Mutual is our choice for the best overall auto insurance company.","pros":["Minimum coverage policies are among the cheapest."],"cons":["Policies with teenage drivers have Liberty&#8217;s least competitive rates."]},"strapline":"After comparing quotes, discounts and other features, we settled on Liberty Mutual as our pick for the best overall auto insurance company.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-10T00:00:00Z","id":"uoSCFXiDCahzb6CsCtqTbi","meta":{"title":"Liberty Mutual Auto Insurance Review - Pros and Cons","description":"With lower-thanaverage policy rates and a wide range of discounts and other features, Liberty Mutual is our choice for the best overall auto insurance company."},"products":[{"slug":"liberty-mutual-auto-insurance","url":"/product/liberty-mutual-auto-insurance","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:34Z","name":"Liberty Mutual Auto Insurance","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:34Z","id":"upePCRnMdT4Li3dJgre7hJ","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-05T14:09:35Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/L35mjvNUmt7iuB3P5xQw53.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:34Z","mimeType":"","name":"bfe523fa6ff044fa2573919635862db3.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/bfe523fa6ff044fa2573919635862db3.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:34Z","id":"L35mjvNUmt7iuB3P5xQw53","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L35mjvNUmt7iuB3P5xQw53.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Liberty Mutual Auto Insurance Review - Pros and Cons","description":"With lower-thanaverage policy rates and a wide range of discounts and other features, Liberty Mutual is our choice for the best overall auto insurance company."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/L35mjvNUmt7iuB3P5xQw53.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:34Z","mimeType":"","name":"bfe523fa6ff044fa2573919635862db3.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/bfe523fa6ff044fa2573919635862db3.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:34Z","id":"L35mjvNUmt7iuB3P5xQw53","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L35mjvNUmt7iuB3P5xQw53.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Liberty Mutual Auto Insurance Review - Pros and Cons","description":"With lower-thanaverage policy rates and a wide range of discounts and other features, Liberty Mutual is our choice for the best overall auto insurance company."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/services/insurance/best-auto-insurance/liberty-mutual-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"travel-and-auto","url":"/travel-and-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:34Z","name":"Travel & Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:34Z","id":"HmhJjMTFinoVnKmEwqRGEm","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"auto-services","url":"/travel-and-auto/auto-services","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:34Z","name":"Auto Services","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:34Z","id":"gtW4iQeXfGEkPDzPmkxeaB","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
