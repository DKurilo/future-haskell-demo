This one comes with CyberLink Power Media Suite, which includes two programs: PowerDirector and PowerProducer. They’re not the latest versions of the software, but they’re still extremely useful, and not just for transferring VHS to DVD.","When you hook up your VCR to PowerDirector, it easily recognizes it. When the digitizing process is done, your converted footage appears in your media bin just like any other video file. Then you can drop it on the timeline and trim away extraneous footage, add transitions between clips, and set chapter markers for your DVD.","Most of the editing tools in the other VHS to DVD converters we reviewed are basic and minimal. PowerDirector, however, is a full-fledged video-editing program that can transform your footage from a bin full of clips to a professional-level video. This software has earned the top spot in our best video editing reviews for more than a decade.","The version of PowerDirector that comes with AVerMedia is a few years old, but it still has powerful tools. You can fix common problems in old, home-shot videotapes like shaky footage, extra noise and distortion, and you can even adjust the lighting and color of the picture. It also has a library of more than 500 special effects that you can browse to enhance your footage so you get exactly what you want.","When you’re done making your videos, PowerDirector allows you to build a menu for the DVD before you burn it. This is a great feature because it lets you program your DVD so it functions just like one you would buy at the store. It has several menu templates and thousands more user-created ones in its video-editing community, Director Zone."]},"id":"20b70736-6739-4a51-a1fb-3fc5bfab42f5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Output"},"id":"36cdd936-ef74-4913-8efb-759fc131ec16","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/8AaWBjurSaXHEjZpWiUypA.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"You can use PowerDirector to burn your converted VHS tapes to a DVD.

You can still watch and enjoy it, but you may be distracted by these imperfections.","PowerDirector also allows you to create stand-alone video files of your tapes. You can export your videos in six different formats, including AVI, MPEG-2, H.264, WMV, MP4 and MKV. You can also optimize your videos for playback on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. In all, PowerDirector has 21 optimization profiles for iOS, Android, BlackBerry and more. It also lets you upload your converted VHS footage to video-sharing sites like YouTube, Facebook, Dailymotion and Vimeo.","PowerDirector is only one of the programs in CyberLink Media Suite. You also get a copy of PowerProducer, which is exclusively devoted to making DVDs. It’s not as easy to use as PowerDirector, but once you learn it, you can dig deep into the creation of the exact DVD you want.
