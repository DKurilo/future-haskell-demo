The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/science/best-weather-stations/\">Weather Stations</a> here.</em>","This weather station is able to receive data from sensors placed up to a mile from the base. This far outdistances other weather stations in this class. It is solar powered and allows you to customize the way measurements are displayed.","Temperatures measured outdoors range from minus 66 to 166 degrees Fahrenheit. This device records minimum and maximum values and notes the time the measurement was done. This allows you to graph the data as a function of time. Temperature measurements appear in either Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on your preference. The relative humidity measured by this wireless weather station includes a range of values associated with the temperature-humidity index.","As with other devices in this class, this instrument measures wind speed. The wind chill is calculated using temperature and wind speed and goes as low as minus 127 degrees Fahrenheit. Barometric pressure is displayed and adjustable for the altitude. This wireless weather station computes the dew point and the rainfall amounts as well as the temperature-heat index.","The weather station&#39;s display is large, bright and viewable from a distance. You can decide what parameters you would like to have on the unit&#39;s screen. You create the weather display you want, allowing for either a few measurements or many, with the clock and calendar consistently visible. This personal weather station also allows multiple computer interface units, so one sensor is able to project weather data to multiple computers. Low battery indicators and data status indicators appear along with the signal strength.","This personal weather station surpasses the distance for wireless transmissions generally seen in similar weather stations. It transmits data over a mile with updates every two seconds without interruption using a spread-spectrum radio frequency. This innovation allows the data sent to the LCD interface or computer to be in real time. It also provides considerable flexibility in placing the sensors. With this sort of flexibility, the unit allows you to cover a broader area while maintaining accurate data.","The Weather Oracle MKIII-LR is a customizable home weather station. Its long-range, wireless distance capacity for multiple computer interfaces and accuracy make it worth considering."]},"id":"2737e801-5654-48dd-b43f-98526366f148","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63343","url":"/weather-oracle-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-09T19:47:00Z","datePublished":"2015-03-09T19:47:00Z","name":"Weather Oracle MKIII-LR","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-09T19:47:00Z","id":"EeeG9NuY45WrPmyxzBLG98","meta":{"title":"Weather Oracle MKIII-LR Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Weather Oracle MKIII-LR is a wireless weather station that provides accurate data on a customizable display.
