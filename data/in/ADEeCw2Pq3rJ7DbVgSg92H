The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/computers/desktops/best-home-computers/\">Home Computer</a> here.</em>","Sometimes, good things come in small packages. The HP Pavilion Mini is a pocket-size home computer that has comparable functionality to larger traditional machines without taking up as much space. It has terrific storage capacity for its size and enough ports to connect to your most important devices and peripherals.","The Mini has a less-powerful processor in comparison to the best home computer options in our review. While the other computers on our lineup have Intel i5 processors – including the other mini desktop we reviewed – the Pavilion Mini’s processor is only an Intel i3-4025U. This processor, combination with the computers limited 4G memory, is not ideal for intensive use. The CPU speed is clocked at 1.9GHz, and it features an Intel HD Graphics 4400 graphics card.","Despite being pint-size, this mini desktop has 1TB of built-in storage – double what the other mini option we reviewed has. With this capacity, you can easily store your favorite photos, music, documents and other files.","This desktop PC doesn’t have the best port selection in comparison with other computers we reviewed, though it does have four USB 3.0 ports, which is enough to connect your most important peripherals. It also features other ports, including HDMI, DisplayPort and a memory card reader.","This mini home computer is portable; thanks to its small, slim design and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, you can move it around your house easily. Measuring 5.7 inches square and 2 inches tall, its compact size saves you precious space in your work area.","HP offers direct technical support via phone, email or live chat, giving you multiple options to choose from. In an undercover test performed by our sister site, Laptop Mag, HP’s customer service received a B-minus score. The test revealed that it was a bit of a hassle to get hold of a live rep, but they eagerly gave out answers to questions, along with a few service upgrade pitches. The computer comes with a one-year warranty, and for an added cost, you can extend it up to three years."]},"id":"efaf4e3b-92cd-451f-8586-37ba567dfae0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"42b881ef-072c-44ad-9bda-fe3b9f96cd9f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You don’t get the processing power, memory capacity or port availability with the HP Pavilion Mini that you do in a traditional tower, but it’s still a decent option for those who want something simple or portable.
