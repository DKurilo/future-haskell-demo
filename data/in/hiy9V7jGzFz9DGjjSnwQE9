You can search by discount, store, category or your own favorites once you create an account. There are cards available from a multitude of websites like Advance Auto Parts, MAC Cosmetics and CVS, though overall the selection wasn&#39;t as vast as some other <a href=\"/best-gift-card-exchange-sites\">gift card exchange services</a>. Selection can vary day to day, but in our tests, GiftCardBin got a mid-range grade of C+ because two of the three gift cards we searched for were available: we could buy Target and Walmart cards, but nothing was available from Amazon.","You can buy electronic or physical gift cards and if you choose the latter you can expect it in the mail within 10 business days. Digital cards will appear in your account within two business days. You can also get vouchers printable at home and redeemable in-store for certain retailers. We saw discounts as high as 32 percent during our testing, which means you can buy a $25 gift card for only $17. That said, there was only one gift card from Brookstone with that high of a discount, with most available cards selling for 25 percent off or less. We also experienced problems with the website&#39;s various search functions. When searching by discount, our search results rendered mostly Build-A-Bear Workshop cards despite ones from other stores being obviously available through other links on the page. It’s unclear why those cards didn’t appear in any search results.","The website design isn&#39;t the best of the websites we tested, but it&#39;s functional. There is a &#34;sell&#34; button on the page though it merely lets you search for a store to swap your cards. The website advertises a &#34;100 day, 100 percent guarantee&#34; though the claims process seems a little intense for buyers. When selling a gift card, you&#39;ll need to make a claim via email or on the phone if you haven&#39;t been paid within two weeks. If you&#39;ve bought a card and it came with an incorrect balance or didn&#39;t come within 10 days of purchase you&#39;ll file a claim the same way, then fill out a form that will be provided and mail it in.","If you’re trying to sell your unwanted gift cards we’d recommend another website like <a href=\"/cardpool-review\">Cardpool</a> or <a href=\"/cardcash-com-review\">CardCash</a>. With GiftCardBin, you’ll need to find a partner location to sell your cards, and frankly the website doesn&#39;t make them easy to find. Rather than being able to search the entire United States you&#39;re prompted to enter your zip code. If there isn&#39;t one within 100 miles of that zip code, you&#39;re prompted to call customer service for more details. We couldn’t find any locations within 100 miles of our office in northern Utah, but when we used a New York City zip code we were directed to numerous check cashing establishments. This isn&#39;t useful if you live in a rural area.","With GiftCardBin, you can easily set up email alerts so you’ll never miss out on a card from the stores you love. The service also has an A+ from the Better Business Bureau, a consumer watchdog group. This was one of only three websites we tested with an A+ rating, though service isn’t technically accredited by the BBB. This means the A+ comes from consumer reviews, so you can rest easy GiftCardBin has a lot of happy customers."]},"id":"911bd19d-5655-4240-98bd-ace7756eeb73","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50067","url":"/giftcardbin-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-07-13T15:35:40Z","datePublished":"2010-07-13T15:35:40Z","name":"GiftCardBin","synopsis":"Buying gift cards from GiftCardBin is similar to the other websites we tested.
