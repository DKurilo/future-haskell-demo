And of course, it is well known for its Swiss Army knives, including the RangerGrip 74. Rather than focusing on a large selection of driver heads and wrenches, RangerGrip offers 14 tools that cover more universal functions.","Active Junky testers were surprised when the bulky 5.1 in multi-tool didn&#39;t prove to offer bulked-up power. The design of the pliers meant a lessened chance for accidentally squeezing fingers or palms, but the bending and cutting power was underwhelming. Further, the 3.9 in blade underperformed when cutting deeper than surface level, and the serrated teeth on the blade were less than productive for sawing.","Despite the ergonomic grips, using the screwdrivers or cutting edges required full concentration for successful application. However, this Victorinox multi-tool is among the easiest to unfold and switch between tools. Active Junky would list this as a good starter full-function multi-tool or backup option for light-duty work because its solid construction is built to last.","<strong>Key Attribute:</strong> Durability","<strong>Best For:</strong> Home, campground and car light duties that are less demanding","<strong>Tester&#39;s Comments:</strong> &#34;Haul this one anywhere with little thought for dropping, dunking or dragging it through tough conditions. The single-lever plier is a well-conceived addition to this multi-tool with solid openers and drivers frequently coming to the rescue. Nothing was exceptional, and there were few surprises in either direction. Neophyte users can certainly build confidence with this model from Victorinox.&#34;","<strong>Trial Results</strong>"]},"id":"2f63d191-7acd-4ecd-b843-76696548409d","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Point Break: </strong>When clipping through metal wire, it cleanly cut with only two squeezes. The design makes for low potential for squeezing and pinching hands during use.","<strong>Around the Bend:</strong> The plier jaws failed this trial, with significant deflection that worried testers that the pair might break in half.","<strong>Rope &#39;Em In:</strong> Cutting through nylon cord required moderate to high pressure and resulted in a subpar cut.","<strong>No Turning Back: </strong>The drive performed poorly over multiple attempts as the drive&#39;s off-center location on one grip handle made it hard to handle and manipulate.","<strong>Eyes on the Pries:</strong> With no locking mechanism on the slotted driver head, it closed under pressure, failing the prying trial.","<strong>Lumberjack Olympics:</strong> Again, testers were surprised that this bulky tool underperformed, only carving to medium depths with high pressure on both the footprint and blade&#39;s thumb guide, and sawing potential was less powerful than expected."],"type":"ul"},"id":"aba9915a-6c16-4f8f-af14-5e2df1a03063","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67967","url":"/victorinox-rangergrip-74-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-10T19:36:27Z","datePublished":"2016-06-10T19:36:27Z","name":"Victorinox RangerGrip 74","synopsis":"Always a leader in knives and multi-tools, Victorinox offers products from cutlery to travel gear.
