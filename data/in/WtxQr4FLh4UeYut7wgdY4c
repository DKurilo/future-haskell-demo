Navigation in this software differs from most, but it&#39;s worth a little digging for such impressive language options. The translation tool allows you to translate text strings directly in the software. Additionally, it links with Google Translate. You can even change the interface to Danish, German, Spanish, French, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese or Swedish if you prefer to read in any of these languages. This is a great option if you&#39;re sharing or collaborating with bilingual families or using old documents written in a different language.","Many of the specialized and standard features are easy to use, but some tasks require some hunting through menus to start. For example, if you want to edit or add a relative, you can&#39;t scroll through to navigate. Instead, Myblood uses arrows at the top of the page like a web browser to toggle through the people and click the one you want. While it&#39;s not as intuitive as scrolling down a list, it keeps the software compact and uncluttered.","When you&#39;re creating a webpage, you can customize content for your homepage text, media, timelines and privacy settings. You get several choices of styles, but there is no way to preview what they look like, so your webpage may take several attempts to perfect.","You can also export images to a Picasa web album for extensive editing. Myblood-line has filters and simplified photo-editing tools for your family-history media. While Myblood-line has impressive photo-editing capabilities, its charting and reporting features are limited. This software has 11 basic family tree charts and reports, but no stylized templates or customization.","Myblood-line has some quality organization features that are useful for a family-tree builder. You can link sources directly to people and to events in their genealogy profile. If you have many sources, you can use this feature to add them as you add personal details. The to-do list lets you link tasks to people, media or entire families. You can connect tasks with a related event like birth, death or religious event and assign a deadline for yourself. The to-do list features markers so you can indicate the importance and the type of task, which will help you complete the most pressing tasks first."]},"id":"1801f31c-f55d-431f-9c7d-d3006fa6576c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d0b0379f-7344-4d5c-9601-2b7b89862a85","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While there are limits to the charting and sharing options, Myblood-line is a solid choice if you plan to handle sources in other languages or collaborate with non-English speakers.
