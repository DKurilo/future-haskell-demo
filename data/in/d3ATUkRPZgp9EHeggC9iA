The Hoover Quick and Light is convenient to use because of its size and maneuverability.","The Hoover Quick and Light Carpet Washer is equipped with five rows of brushes across an 11-inch cleaning path. It has a fingertip trigger, so you can apply extra cleaning solution for stain removal and for cleaning high traffic areas.","This carpet-cleaning machine has two one-gallon water tanks that keep clean and dirty water separate. These large-capacity water tanks allow you to get more work done because you don’t have to stop and refill as often as you would if you were using a machine with smaller tanks. The tanks are transparent, so you can see when the water needs to be changed.","Unfortunately, this carpet cleaning machine does not come with a built-in hot water heater to keep the water at an optimal temperature. However, you can still fill the tank with hot water to get sterile carpets.","This rug cleaner is one of the lightest we reviewed. It only weighs 11.7 pounds, so if you have back problems or difficulty lifting, you will like this steerable cleaner. It fits easily in small spaces and will maneuver around furniture so you don&#39;t have to move your furniture or do a lot of heavy lifting.","If you have many emergency cleaning needs due to pet accidents or frequent spills, this cleaner is ideal. Because it is lightweight and easy to use, it is convenient for quick clean ups. One 16-ounce bottle of Deep Cleansing Carpet Detergent is included with your purchase to help get you started.","The power cord is short at 20 feet long, so you will have to plug in and out of outlets when you go from room to room. While the Quick and Light is great for cleaning floors, it does not include a hose or cleaning tools for above ground or stair cleaning.","The Hoover Quick and Light Carpet Washer has a one-year warranty. The Hoover website offers email and telephone contact information, so you can contact a representative if you have any concerns or questions. There is also a FAQs page for commonly asked questions. Because Hoover is a major carpet cleaner manufacturer, there are service centers or certified repair shops in most major cities."]},"id":"4405bdc6-820c-4439-a0ff-9590b22ae5e2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"eb3fd86f-da0d-4a78-b190-e1051c04c33f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This lightweight carpet cleaner is ideal for homes that have frequent spills and pet accidents because it is lightweight and maneuverable.
