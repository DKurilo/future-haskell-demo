You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","You can use the Egg Station ES-1200 <a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">electric egg cooker</a> to cook a large batch of eggs quickly for big groups of people. The eggs are ready to eat in only 120 seconds, allowing you to make breakfast and other meals for many people at once.","With an exterior made of stainless steel, the Egg Station ES-1200 cooks your eggs using a steam method to produce patties that are moist and evenly cooked. The steam comes from the pivoting cover, which closes over the eggs being cooked. In approximately two minutes, they are ready to be removed and replaced with the next round, helping to speed up the process in commercial kitchens. The compact size of this appliance makes it easy to store in most kitchens.","When the egg cooker is on, the power switch illuminates as a warning that the accessory is heated. It shows both audio and visual indicators when your food is ready, emitting a noise when it is time to remove the eggs from the cooker. The included plug allows you to power the 17.25 x 17.5 x 9-inch griddle correctly. The control panel is located on the front of the cooker, letting you set your heat and power in one spot.","Six different models are available in this line of egg cookers. Two feature a nickel-plated grill, and all of them deliver individual 3-inch patties. With the plated grill, you cook your eggs on one side while preparing ham, precooked bacon or other breakfast meats on the opposite side. This lets you make a full meal using one surface instead of multiple pieces of cookware. All items beneath the cover cook with the same steam method, keeping everything moist.","The set includes 12 nonstick rings to give your eggs an even, round shape with a diameter of 3 inches, while the material keeps them from clinging to the sides. Optional accessories for the machine include a spatula, scraper and a squeeze bottle to aid you in preparing your food. You can use the utensils during active cooking time to make cooking easier. The optional brush lets you scrub down the griddle in case you need a full cleaning before the next day&#39;s round of food. Due to the stainless steel construction, this electric egg cooker is easy to clean and maintain in a professional kitchen.","The Egg Station ES-1200 is an expensive piece of equipment that is best suited for restaurants and commercial use. It cooks efficiently and quickly for large crowds of people."]},"id":"767949c2-462a-4aba-a58e-8e11f28e2ee0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63187","url":"/egg-station-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-03T19:11:28Z","datePublished":"2015-03-03T19:11:28Z","name":"Egg Station ES-1200","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-03T19:11:28Z","id":"XPAHNJHGok8NjaE9HnkLdA","meta":{"title":"Egg Station ES-1200 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Egg Station.
