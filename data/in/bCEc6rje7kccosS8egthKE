The sound module is tucked away nicely in the back of the stuffed animal and has four nature sounds and four lullabies to help your baby fall asleep and stay asleep. The heartbeat sound profile is the most realistic among the <a href=\"/best-baby-sound-machines\">baby sound machines</a> we tested, and the spring showers sound did a good job of masking external noise in our test. It’s a bit more expensive than most products we reviewed, but it has the potential for extended use because you can remove the sound module to make it a normal stuffed animal.","The Sleep Sheep is softer and easier to clean than the other stuffed animal we tested, the <a href=\"/bubzi-co-soothing-sleep-owl-review\">Bubzi Co Soothing Sleep Owl</a>. The Sleep Sheep is machine washable and squishes down to a more compact size to fit in a diaper bag. The sound module is secured in the pouch on the back of the sheep by a flimsy Velcro strap, so consider reinforcing that design flaw if you want to leave the sound module in place while your toddler plays with it. There’s also a Velcro strap on the back to attach the Sleep Sheep to a crib or car seat.","We removed the sound module to conduct our sound masking test because the stuffed animal reduces the volume and sound quality significantly. The spring showers sound profile is high-pitched and did a great job of masking the sound of a vacuum in an adjacent room. The thunder clap in that sound profile sounds natural and isn’t startling, which is rare for a rain sound profile. The timer on the Sleep Sheep has two options: 23 and 45 minutes. This baby sound machine doesn’t have a continuous play feature and it isn’t powered by an AC adapter. Battery operation adds to its portability and the batteries are included.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Cloud B Sleep Sheep is a cuddly stuffed animal with a well-designed sound machine. It is a great option if you aren’t sure how your infant will react to sleeping with nature sounds and lullabies because it doubles as a plush, machine washable playmate."]},"id":"d1edac51-0d87-41d6-b8dd-65050e759054","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52312","url":"/cloud-b-sleep-sheep-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-03-07T18:51:03Z","datePublished":"2011-03-07T18:51:03Z","name":"Cloud B Sleep Sheep","synopsis":"The Cloud B Sleep Sheep is a soft and plush stuffed animal with a removeable sound machine.
