You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Worx WG789 PaceSetter is an <a href=\"/home/outdoor/best-electric-lawn-mowers/\">electric lawn mower</a> that features a self-propel function and a wide 19-inch cutting path. Gas-powered mowers require maintenance, produce smelly fumes and plenty of noise. With a cordless lawn mower like the PaceSetter, you can quietly mow your lawn and get a clean cut without worrying about oil changes or running out of fuel.","The removable 36-volt battery can last up to 55 minutes on a full charge and this should be plenty of power if you have kept up on your mowing. The Worx PaceSetter&#39;s lead-acid battery weighs 30 pounds, which is a third of the mower&#39;s weight. It is removable and fully recharges in 16 hours. The battery level indicator is a convenient power feature of the Worx WG789. This helps you see the amount of energy your electric lawn mower still has left as you mow.","The Worx WG789 PaceSetter can handle lawns up to 1/3 of an acre and the self-propel function ca help you mow more efficiently while putting less stress on your body. A unique feature of the self-propel feature is the propulsion engage handle. This handle is supposed to guide the mower&#39;s speed by monitoring the amount of force you use to push the mower. The faster you walk behind the mower, the more force you use, and the more rapidly the mower&#39;s drive system should accelerate to keep up with your pace.","While this is a great feature, the drive system frequently has a delayed response to the amount of force you are applying to the handle. The delay means you&#39;ll often end up pushing the handle too far, and the drive system then has to rapidly accelerate to catch up. As a result, the PaceSetter&#39;s system can take some getting used to as it frequently jerks forward or moves along slower than you are walking behind it.","The biggest problem with an electric mower that has a lead-acid battery is the weight. The best electric lawn mowers strike a balance between weight and performance and the WG789 weighs over 90 pounds. If you like to bag your grass, the weight of a full bag will increase the weight of this mower even more and make it nearly impossible to push if you struggle finding the strength to move heavy objects.","If you prefer to mow your lawn when the rest of your neighborhood is still in bed, consider the WG789 for its Quiet mode. With the flip of a switch, you can smother the noise of the mower&#39;s motor. It is a bit of a mystery how Worx pulled this one off, but Quiet mode definitely reduces the WG789&#39;s noise.","Worx warrants the WG789 for two years against any defects. It offers customer service online through a live chat feature, so you can message an online representative if you have any questions. If you prefer to speak to a representative over the phone, a hotline is also available. Unfortunately, there are no service centers available for the WG789, so all repairs and claims are done through their main office."]},"id":"c06d5854-9d47-4cc8-94a6-aa7a9fc3c7d1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"05e813e6-b7a0-4c1c-b5b9-e75b38ef381e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Worx WG789 has many of the features in advanced electric lawn mowers, but it is a bit less effective when compared to the best mowers on our lineup.
