The Oxlife Independence portable <a href=\"/best-portable-oxygen-concentrators\">oxygen concentrator</a> – made by O2 Concepts – does just that. With the Dynamic Network Analysis (DNA) add-on feature, you can stay connected to a team of engineers who monitor your concentrator to ensure it’s always working properly and who can fix issues as they arise. The device also monitors your usage rates, breathing rate and environment conditions to tailor itself to be more efficient. It can even locate your device via GPS if you happen to lose it.","Depending on your needs, you can opt for a single or double-battery setup. Each battery lasts up to about 5.75 hours on a low setting. You can also recharge the battery or simply run the device off either an AC or DC power adapter. Each battery can recharge in an impressive 1.5 hours – quite a bit faster than nearly all other models currently available – and two batteries can be recharged in 2.5 hours.","It is also one of the quietest units in our comparison, running at about 40 decibels while used on a level 2 setting, which is equivalent to a whisper. It also comes with a five-year manufacturer warranty on the system and a one-year warranty on the battery and accessories.","The concentrator works for both continuous flow and pulse flow users. It weighs 16.7 pounds, making it one of the heaviest units in our lineup, but it&#39;s still considerably lighter than the <a href=\"/nidek-review\">Nidek Buvo Lite</a> and the <a href=\"/devilbiss-review\">DeVilbiss iGo</a>. However, it has a built-in protective case with large wheels that you can easily roll around with you wherever you go. It measures 20.2 inches tall, 10.9 inches wide and 8 inches deep. It is FAA approved for domestic flights and is small enough to be brought as a carry-on. It can conveniently stow below the seat in front of you.","The O2 Concepts Oxlife Independence is a great option for users who need portable oxygen but who like the benefits of staying connected to a technical support team that can troubleshoot a wide array of problems. Though it is one of the larger units we looked at, it runs quietly, offers multiple power sources and is FAA approved for domestic flights."]},"id":"e41dcb39-4006-4ed6-afdc-1b52e0a632c5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68652","url":"/o2-concepts-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alexander-eriksen","url":"/author/alexander-eriksen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Alexander Eriksen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"hwemruvZsTXWMqRixKJ49","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-28T20:46:29Z","datePublished":"2016-10-28T20:46:29Z","name":"O2 Concepts Oxlife Independence","synopsis":"Good medical equipment should do more than fix a singular problem – it should actively strive to work harder for you and give you more over the long run.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Good medical equipment should do more than fix a singular problem – it should actively strive to work harder for you and give you more over the long run.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-28T20:46:29Z","id":"CxbJWe4vN66z4G3LvTUe89","meta":{"title":"O2 Concepts Oxlife Independence Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Oxlife Independence portable oxygen concentrator has granular flow rate adjustment increments.
