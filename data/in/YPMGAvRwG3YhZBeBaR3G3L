Along with DVDs, the Mustek PL-510 reads CDs, CD-R/Ws, Kodak Picture CDs and jpeg files, and can also play properly-formatted MP3 files. What’s more, The Mustek PL-510 comes with a MMC/SD card reader slot, furthering its functionality and compatibility. Most importantly, this portable DVD player boasts a 10 inch active matrix TFT screen with a built-in 16:9 wide-screen aspect ratio. While most portable DVD players are coming around to this aspect ratio, most lack the screen size to really make a difference. Not so for the Mustek PL-510.","<br/>The 10 inch active matrix TFT screen truly is a thing of beauty, delivering a picture quality standard in larger and more costly televisions without the weight—and expense.","<br/>Experts like the Mustek PL-510 for its overall value. Only taking up about the space of a magazine (the remote control is about the size of credit card), this portable DVD player still delivers impressive picture and sound quality while maintaining a very affordable price tag. Users love the Mustek PL-510 for its versatility and durability. This portable DVD player truly was intended to go anywhere and do—well, just about anything. And with a 3-hour battery pack, you can actually watch an entire movie on one battery.","<br/>The Mustek PL-510 might just be everything you could ever want in a portable DVD player."]},"id":"474ca0c8-7c90-460b-9a14-5d800ec61303","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_6246","url":"/mustek-pl607-2950-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-knoder","url":"/author/jonathan-knoder","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jonathan Knoder","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"yRHneGGUztMrGu99zxra6M","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-06-11T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-06-11T06:00:00Z","name":"Musket PL-607 PL607","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":38,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-06-11T17:00:03Z","id":"YPMGAvRwG3YhZBeBaR3G3L","meta":{"title":"Musket PL-607 PL607 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
