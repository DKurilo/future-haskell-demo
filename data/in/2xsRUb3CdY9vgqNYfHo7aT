You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Equator EZ4000CV <a href=\"/best-washer-dryer-combos\">washer dryer combo</a> was the first machine to offer both venting and condensing for the dryer cycle. This means you can plug it into a vented outlet, but you are also able to pull it out and hook it to a standard faucet. It is a small unit but doesn’t have wheels, making it hard to move around when you need it.","The machine has 14 different washing cycles, which puts it in the same class as the best washers in that category. Still, there is only one drying option. You are able to change the drying time, but you cannot change the temperature level. This is a concern if you have clothes that shrink in hotter settings. This machine also has only one soil level setting, so you can’t adjust the speed, time or agitation to deep clean heavily soiled clothing.","The machine costs an estimated $13 a year to operate if you use it once a week. The drum is small, though, so it’s likely you’ll need to use it more often, especially if you have a large family. The drum is 1.6 cubic feet, which is enough for two people but lacking in space for a large family or for big items like blankets and sheets.","The machine’s design leaves something to be desired. The front of the washer dryer is white plastic with a small door. You can control the different washer levels with a knob, and extra features are available using push buttons below the digital display. The dial and the LED display, while functional, share a confined space next to the automatic dispenser drawer. This creates a busy design that looks like the cycle and LED options are running together.","Equator offers several levels of support on its website. There is a complete customer service tab that provides a support phone number and email address, and the company has offices around the world. The main page for the combination washer dryer has reviews from other customers and a video that explains how to use the machine. There is an online manual, which has some helpful information. The manual doesn’t have full PDF functionality, however, so you can’t do keyword searches to find specific topics you’re looking for. The warranty is only the standard one year on parts, service, motor and drum."]},"id":"39ffab5a-c776-4cc2-996d-32c6dbc31287","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c10c5b3a-c52d-4296-9e35-ccace2418560","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Equator lacks the functionality of the best washer dryer combos and isn’t convenient to move around in a small home because it lacks wheels. The ability to vent is a plus, but if you choose to use the condenser, moving it around to a faucet means more work for you. It only has one dryer setting and one soil level setting, so this limits your options for washing and drying clothes. There are better choices available for around the same price."]},"id":"fd2f0bff-d3d1-4426-be12-49be80e7aefc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67065","url":"/equator-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-23T15:50:52Z","datePublished":"2015-09-23T15:50:52Z","name":"Equator EZ4000CV","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":61,"verdict":"The Equator EZ4000CV, while compact, is not easy to move around and lacks such fine tuning capabilities as spin speed control and varied soil level settings that would make it a better machine for washing clothes of all kinds.","pros":["It can either be vented or plugged into a faucet."],"cons":["There is only one dryer setting."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-07-19T00:00:00Z","id":"2xsRUb3CdY9vgqNYfHo7aT","meta":{"title":"Equator EZ4000CV Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Equator EZ4000CV has separate attachments for both venting and condensing.
