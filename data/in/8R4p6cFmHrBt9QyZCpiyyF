Though it is the largest unit on our lineup, it is still easy to use and clean. We were impressed with its various safety features and quiet performance.","This machine quickly slices all food types. It excelled at cutting bread and vegetables in our tests, though they weren&#39;t consistently even. It sounded a bit labored while processing cheese and various meats, though it produced quality slices overall, both thin and thick. The motor is belt-driven and has 150 watts of power. After slicing, the machine is easy to clean, as the carriage tray tilts up and out, letting you lean it over a sink to clean it. The hand guard is fully detachable, as is the blade, which only takes a couple seconds to remove.","The blade is made of stainless steel and has an 8.6-inch diameter, which is one of the largest in our lineup. It has smooth edges, which are typically ideal for slicing vegetables and cheese. Its slices, though not always even across, had no jagged edges and looked nice in our tests. The slice thickness is easy to adjust with the knob by the carriage tray. However, it has the most limited thickness range we saw, from 0.06 inches up to half an inch.","It is large for a consumer-grade meat slicer, measuring 19.4 x 12.1 x 14.4 inches. If you aren&#39;t planning on keeping it on an open countertop, you may want to measure the area you wish to store it in to ensure it has big enough dimensions. It weighs 15 pounds, making it also the heaviest unit on our lineup, though it is still reasonably light enough to move around. For a smaller meat slicer that is easier to store, you might consider the <a href=\"/chef-s-choice-review\">Chef&#39;s Choice 610 by EdgeCraft</a>.","You can slice without feeling stressed about safety, as this slicer comes with a variety of safety functions. It has suction cups that stick soundly to your countertop, preventing it from slipping around and risking your safety. Furthermore, its recessed power switch reduces the likelihood of you accidentally turning it on, though the button is still easy enough to reach and press.","It comes with a lightweight food pusher that doubles as a hand guard so you don&#39;t have to worry about getting your fingers too close to the sharp blade. It has small spikes that help grip the food and keep it in the right position for a clean slice.","Weston backs this slicer with a one-year warranty, giving you plenty of time to use it free from worry. Its customer service team is available to you either by email or telephone, whichever you prefer. While Weston does not have a digital copy of the product&#39;s owner manual available on its website, it does have a general FAQs section that you can use as a resource."]},"id":"0d820cb6-f309-4bb1-b181-039ad5f95413","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"050e1b37-5d4f-4c26-af2d-a64c4c48d228","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Weston 61-0901-W slicer has a decently powerful motor and a large blade that, together, produce clean-looking slices, albeit ones that are somewhat uneven across the cut.
