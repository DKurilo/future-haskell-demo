The tire itself is made up of a silica-enhanced compound combined with a tread pattern designed to promote consistent traction and long-term wear. The tire features important elements such as four wide circumference channels and lateral grooves for water evacuation and high-density sipes for extra traction.","As an all-season tire, the LTX M/S2 tire is intended largely for use on paved roads. For the occasional off-roading trip, you’ll find these provide sufficient traction. However, for more frequent adventures, you may want to consider all terrain tires instead. The main tradeoff in going all-terrain versus all-season is a reduced level of traction on icy roads. The treads on this tire excel in both winter and summer conditions on paved surfaces, which make it an excellent investment for regular travel.","This set of tires carries with it a lengthy tread-life warranty of 70,000 miles. During this period, the tires can be replaced for little-to-no cost, provided you return to the tire store that installed your tires originally. Even with this lengthy warranty, many consumers report having driven more than 90,000 miles on the tires with little decrease in performance. This high tread life plays largely to these truck tires’ advantage in comparison to cheaper options.","Picking the best all-season truck tires isn’t just a matter of price. The tread pattern on your tire largely influences the gas mileage of your vehicle and can thus impact its overall performance and health. If you want a value-building tire that excels on paved surfaces, the Michelin LTX M/S2 is one of the best options available."]},"id":"67b65c03-e806-41fe-aff7-8d5a535ad3a3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58022","url":"/michelin-ltx-m-s2-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T15:02:40Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T15:02:40Z","name":"Michelin LTX M/S2","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
