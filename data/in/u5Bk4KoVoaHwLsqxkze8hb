You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Boston Acoustics SoundWare is one of the best <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater speaker systems</a> we reviewed. It comes with a subwoofer and five small satellite speakers that are only about as big as a baseball. The small home theater speakers don&#39;t look like much, but when you put them all together, they combine for a full surround sound experience. The subwoofer rounds out the sound quality by producing powerful bass tones that submerge you in the action. ","<strong>Audio Performance</strong>","Our reviewers listened closely to each home theater speaker system and compared them based on dialogue clarity, bass response and surround sound effect as they watched a scene from an action movie. This system scored highly on all graded criteria.","This system&#39;s bass response was among the best in our lineup. During a fight scene, we were drawn into the action by the punches, kicks and crashing furniture. The bass was punchy and definitive without sounding muddy. Even after volume matching the subwoofers, the subwoofer had plenty of volume available if you feel the need for more bass. Our entire panel was impressed with the bass response.","The surround sound effect was almost equally as impressive, scoring an A- from our listeners. Compared to other speakers in our lineup, the small cubed speakers don&#39;t look like they could produce much for surround sound. However, the satellite speakers surrounded our listeners with sharp, clear treble. The small cubed speakers produce powerful high-frequency tones that cut right through the strong bass of the subwoofer, providing a well-balanced tonal quality."]},"id":"cd109615-e2c4-4452-a4e4-ee2e19c3ac5a","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/XqDc5JkXcfiAf7CN8Yzy28.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/59753-boston-acoustics-soundware4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XqDc5JkXcfiAf7CN8Yzy28.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"XqDc5JkXcfiAf7CN8Yzy28","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XqDc5JkXcfiAf7CN8Yzy28.jpg","alt":""},"id":"15d5ce9e-624f-41b8-9a4d-15ac34a135c3","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There is a scene where a villain is twirling a big spiked ball on a chain over her head. As this is happening, you can hear the sound of the ball quickly shoot from one speaker to the next – all of them working in unison and surrounding the listeners with the sound effect. Speaker systems with poor surround effects sound as though the audio is only coming from the front-left and front-right speakers. Surround sound submersion is one of the keys to emulating the movie theater experience. This 5.1 surround sound system excelled in this area.","Dialogue clarity scored a B with our listening panel. We connected the front-left and front-right speakers to a channel switcher so we could quickly switch between different pairs of speakers to get a direct comparison. As we switched between the speakers, this Boston Acoustics pair was a bit brighter and thinner than most left and right speakers. This makes the dialogue sound clear, but it doesn&#39;t have as much body or depth as others. Without the subwoofer, the dialogue would sound a bit weak, but when the system is set up as a whole, the results are great. ","<strong>Satellite Speaker Specifications</strong>"]},"id":"997425bf-4fe9-438c-bb28-01a048827b3b","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/cKMvSpFG9FhRvVsgxvp5NK.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"and a 0.5-inch tweeter.
