This also gives you a bit more softness compared to a single piece of foam, and it’s more breathable so you don’t get hot at night. It’s also hypoallergenic, which is good for allergy sufferers. Testers described feeling their head sink into this pillow but still having firm support so their heads were perfectly cradled.","The Sleep Number Comfortfit pillow is a bit pricey, and it only comes in two sizes, standard and king. But you also get a five-year warranty just in case something goes wrong. Sleep Number also gives you 30 days to try out your pillow and decide if you want to keep it. This isn’t as generous as most other pillows we tested.
