Since then, the service has become one of the most popular <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-systems\">medical alert systems</a> in the United States and Canada.","Life Alert, like other medical monitoring companies we reviewed, provides you with a pendant you wear as a wristband or around your neck. The medical alert device features an emergency button that you can push in the case of an emergency. The pendant then communicates with the console connected to the customer&#39;s phone line that contacts Life Alert&#39;s monitoring center, which in turn contacts first responders or other emergency contacts.","A Life Alert technician professionally installs each system. This is a great feature for those with family who live too far away to help. However, the company charges an installation fee as well as an activation fee for its service. No long-term contract is required to use Life Alert, but a cancellation fee applies if you cancel without 30 days&#39; notice.","The core feature of the Life Alert medical alert system is the console that enables two-way communication with the company&#39;s reputable monitoring center. The operational range between the console and pendant is 150 feet. This range is the smallest of the medical alert devices we reviewed and makes the system best suited for smaller living areas. All products include a lifetime warranty.","While Life Alert doesn&#39;t offer popular additional premium products, like a voice extender or lockbox, it does include a 911 phone, a phone exclusively designed to contact emergency services directly, as part of its monitoring repertoire. The Life Alert GPS mobile service allows you or your loved ones to leave home – and the limited 150-foot range of the console – to enjoy the freedom of coverage everywhere. Simply press any button on the phone to connect to Life Alert&#39;s monitoring center.","Life Alert also offers premium plans that include fire and carbon monoxide monitoring through additional monitored detectors it can place throughout your home. You can also count on Life Alert during other non-medical emergencies, such as a break-in."]},"id":"65e6b5e2-cca4-4062-b1e3-fe214fc23e23","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dae5a987-1b7a-4315-b592-3352ad4c897e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Life Alert medical alert system has the smallest range for its base station console of the services we reviewed.
