The last thing you want to do is scuff up your nice floor or injure your back while moving these hefty devices. To make things easier, look for a chair that has wheels on the bottom, making it more mobile. If you&#39;re using a massage chair regularly, you should expect it to get a little dirty, and since it is an electrical appliance, it is best not to get it wet. Try finding a chair that is made of soil-resistant or easy-cleaning material.","Since massage chairs can cost a lot, it’s smart to buy one with a decent warranty. The best massage chair warranties last at least three years. If you want to easily access a beverage, cell phone, MP3 player, book or other item while getting your massage, look for a chair that comes with built-in pockets and cup holders. Massage chairs tend to have weight and height limits, so before making a purchase, be sure to find a product that fits your body. They are rare, but you can find some machines that have adjustable leg extensions to fit taller and shorter users.","Many massage chairs require assembly upon delivery. If you&#39;d prefer that a qualified professional put it together, look for a company that offers assembly services, often referred to as white glove delivery. This service typically costs extra. Keep in mind that some products require minimal assembly while others are relatively toolbox and labor heavy.","<strong>Types of Massage</strong>","Shiatsu massage traditionally relies on a therapist applying pressure with the fingers, thumbs and palms. The aim of this style of massage is to improve health by stimulating your internal energy system. A massage chair mimics this with small, round balls beneath the padded surface of the chair. Oftentimes these balls move in circular motions at varying speeds. Vibration massage is much harder to attain by hand, so if you enjoy this style it&#39;s best to own a massage chair. The entire chair vibrates depending on the settings you select, which can feel good and be very calming.","The way massage chairs mimic various types of massage is through the track behind the seat. Most massage chairs work on an S-Track system. The chair is built on a steel frame in the shape of a letter S that follows the curve of the spine. This frame has rollers mounted on to it that move. Other chairs are built with a hybrid L/S-Track, which is similar to the S-Track but curves below the seat under the back of a person&#39;s thighs. There are other kinds of track depending on the chair you buy that will address different massage needs, so make sure to try out the chair before you buy it.","Some chairs also have body scanning technology. This means the chair uses sensors to evaluate the user&#39;s size, weight and curves to deliver the best massage. These chairs usually take a moment or two to complete the evaluation, so it&#39;s important to sit still during the process."]},"id":"e8ba6fc6-057b-40ab-a5e4-4a2af53f32a5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"01daf84f-401b-4c77-b382-eb073e2bc52d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0187VV2F0/?&tag=ttr_chair-massagers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1868[art|NA[pid|69485[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Best Choice Products</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029PGLGG/?&tag=ttr_chair-massagers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1868[art|NA[pid|69487[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Human Touch</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MXESPKI/?&tag=ttr_chair-massagers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1868[art|NA[pid|69488[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">INADA DreamWave</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M24RKQY/?&tag=ttr_chair-massagers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1868[art|NA[pid|69489[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Kahuna</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BPE533E/?&tag=ttr_chair-massagers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1868[art|NA[pid|69490[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Luraco</a>","<a href=\"http://www.medicalbreakthrough.org/breakthrough8-final.php\">Medical Breakthrough</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003H96IYS/?&tag=ttr_chair-massagers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1868[art|NA[pid|69492[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Osaki</a>","<a href=\"http://www.panasonic.com/ca/consumer/health-beauty/massage-chairs/ep-maj7k.html\">Panasonic</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WRNTQX4/?&tag=ttr_chair-massagers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1868[art|NA[pid|69494[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Real Relax</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014VBOIOC/?&tag=ttr_chair-massagers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1868[art|NA[pid|69495[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Relaxonchair</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"7d36e672-142c-48b4-9d78-adbdbe02dbbb","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1868","url":"/best-chair-massagers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-07-13T16:03:26Z","datePublished":"2017-07-24T20:42:17Z","name":"Best Massage Chairs","synopsis":"From zero-gravity to deep tissue shiatsu, learn which chair massagers loosen muscles and help you relax the most.","review":{},"strapline":"From zero-gravity to deep tissue shiatsu, learn which chair massagers loosen muscles and help you relax the most.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","id":"7835RcJ8NUGRqqxDbr8yiS","meta":{"title":"Best Massage Chairs of 2019 -
