You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Sharp LC52LE640Uis the next <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TV</a> in our lineup and, while it doesn&#39;t perform as famously as some of Sharp&#39;s larger-screened models do, it can still hold its own in comparison with the big players in this category. While the screen only measures 52 inches, whereas 55-inch screens are more standard, this model in the Quattron line still makes a solid case for itself.","Sharp uses a proprietary LED technology that goes by the name of AQUOS, which, from what our testing revealed, is a technology with a great deal  of hype and not much substance. The picture is bright and clear, but the blacks in the movies we tested never fully approached the deepness we&#39;ve seen on some other models&#39; screens. However, after watching a movie on this set, the few visible defects that were present at the beginning became less and less noticeable. Even with these few drawbacks, the Sharp LC52LE640U has a lot going for it and is a solid choice among LED TVs. If you&#39;re on a budget, this is a good set to start with.","The 52-inch screen looks a great deal bigger than it is. Its discreet bezel and thin panel make it a great, unobtrusive set to place on a wall or in a theater room. The Sharp LC52LE640Ualso has a built-in subwoofer along with its two 10-watt bezel-embedded speakers. The Sharp model we reviewed does not offer local dimming or 3D capabilities like several of the other LED TVs on our lineup, bringing it down in our rankings.","A few standard specifications for the 52-inch Sharp TV lived up to our expectations, including a middle-of-the-road refresh rate of 120Hz, a contrast ratio of 4,000,000:1 and a standard 176-degree viewing angle. It also supports standard widescreen and high-definition resolutions. As you can see, there isn&#39;t anything exceptional about this TV, but it meets average specifications on almost every front. The Sharp LC52LE640U offers a respectable array of connections, including two USB ports, four HDMI connectors, two composite video inputs, two audio inputs, one PC and one Ethernet input.","Sharp&#39;s customer support is competitive, offering a one-year limited warranty, telephone support, email support and live chat. The company provides a selection of downloadable manuals online and a comprehensive FAQs section. We were almost always able to find answers to our questions in the existing documentation."]},"id":"2ba4b108-eda3-4159-8961-54d891dd9b81","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2217e6cc-e4e8-4399-84be-08be83851ad8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sharp LC52LE640U LED TV is a great buy for anyone in the market for an affordable flat-panel LED TV.
