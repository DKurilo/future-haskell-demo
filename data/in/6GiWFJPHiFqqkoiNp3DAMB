You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Card Hub serves as a gift card aggregator, combining the inventory and features of three different gift card exchange sites into one. While this limits the amount of support the site can offer, it increases your selling opportunities and the likelihood of finding that perfect gift card.","Since Card Hub serves more as a portal to a marketplace than a dedicated site to exchange gift cards, you can list any type of gift card at any price. For instance, you can <a href=\"/best-gift-card-exchange-sites\">sell gift cards</a> for local restaurants or businesses, and Card Hub will direct them to an applicable marketplace where people in your area can buy them. While you can set the price of your gift card, any gift cards you sell must be over $10.","The structure of this site excludes it from having a specific percentage that it pays toward a card. The sellers decide how much the gift cards will sell for, which consequentially affects how much the maximum discount will be. While this allows the seller to set their own profits, it eliminates any set of parameters for the buyer.","Card Hub does not directly buy or sell cards. Instead, it directs you to the respective company’s website, which then completes your transaction. As such, you can buy and sell gift cards electronically or by mailing the plastic card to either another company or directly to a buyer or seller. The gift card exchange service makes payments in cash or through PayPal.","Where you buy or sell your gift card greatly determines the shipping fees. If you list the gift card independently on Card Hub’s site, you are responsible for shipping. However, if you sell it to one of Card Hub’s partnering sites, such as GiftCardRescue.com, you may qualify for free shipping. Since the service is more of a marketplace, it is missing some key features that some stand-alone gift card exchange services offer. There are no expiration restrictions, so if you are purchasing a gift card, ensure it does not expire. The site also lacks a bulk buying and selling department.","Unique to Card Hub is its Wish List feature. Most sites offer email notification when a specific gift card becomes available on their site. Card Hub offers such a notification, but it also has a Wish List that works similar to a wedding registry. You simply indicate which cards you are interested in, and your friends or family can access your Wish List from the website.","With three different gift card communities, the inventory is large and offers gift cards for most major retailers. To help you search through such a large selection, the site has a general search function, as well as specific filters that enable you to search by retailer, category, price or discount. You also can search by distance, through Facebook friends and even by delivery methods.","Card Hub serves as a platform for buying and selling gift cards but removes itself from the actual process. The transactions and responsibility are solely through the two parties buying, selling or trading their gift cards. As such, the support options are limited and the service focuses more on buyer beware. The website features FAQs, an email address for support, an online contact form and a guarantee. It does not provide a phone number for customer service.","Card Hub is different from other gift card exchange services. It serves as an aggregator that will direct you to other sites that will suit your needs. It holds one of the largest inventories that puts most gift cards in one place for you to search for and purchase."]},"id":"d90b0339-51cb-4af2-a78c-5542ed06c2a7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56132","url":"/card-hub-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-04-05T17:07:26Z","datePublished":"2013-04-05T17:07:26Z","name":"Card Hub","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-04-05T17:07:26Z","id":"6GiWFJPHiFqqkoiNp3DAMB","meta":{"title":"Card Hub Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Card Hub provides access to a large amount of gift card buyers and sellers.
