You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The ClearClick QuickConvert is a <a href=\"/best-slide-to-digital-image-converters\">slide to digital image converter</a> that works on physical prints, slides and negatives, and features a 20 MP resolution output. This is one of the highest resolutions of any device we reviewed during our comparison.","The scanner is a standalone device, meaning that it’s not dependent on a computer connection to run and process your images. You can simply plug it in to a power source and start using it. Additionally, it ships with an SD card so you can immediately stop using the converter and even transfer your images once they’re converted.","If your old photo collection consists solely of 35 mm slides and negatives, as well as physical printed photos, then this converter is a decent option for you. It can process photos of 3 x 5, 4 x 6 and 5 x 7 prints, which are the most common sizes. However, the unit lacks the ability to process and digitize 110 and 126 slides and negatives, as well as Super 8, so if your collection contains those formats, you’ll be better off considering another slide to digital converter.","Despite being limited by its film format compatibility, the QuickConvert comes with a variety of accessories than can help make your photo conversion process a bit simpler. The included cleaning brush can assist in removing dust and smudges on old slides, and image editing software allows you to apply more in-depth editing and polishing to your images.","The film to digital converter ships with a one-year warranty from the manufacturer. There aren’t any informational resources or a support page on the company’s website. You can contact the technical support team via email, though the company doesn’t provide a telephone number or a live chat option. The converter measures 9.5 x 8.5 x 5.5 inches and weighs 3 pounds."]},"id":"fefa81a1-84aa-47e5-9518-8e1b2c73667f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"83e32386-0f21-4f66-a93a-f4048b4c5ce4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ClearClick QuickConvert is packed with features and accessories but lacks considerable format compatibility and wasn’t the easiest to use in comparison with the best slide to digital converters we reviewed.
