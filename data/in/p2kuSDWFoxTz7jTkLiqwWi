The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-snow-blowers\">Snow Blower Reviews</a> here.</em>","For homes or neighborhoods in need of a simple and reliable snow thrower, the Snow Joe SJ620 is an exceptional value and a reliable device for small jobs. Whether you need to clear a short driveway or a long stretch of sidewalk, this electric snow blower is well equipped for removing snow with minimal effort.","Clearing snow from around your home can become tiring with a shovel. The Snow Joe can help you regain control of your paved areas within a reasonable amount of time. It excels when the snow is still fresh and hasn’t had time to be compacted or driven on. This is largely because it is a single-stage snow blower. It doesn’t have the same capabilities as a gas-powered dual-stage snow blower, but it still packs quite a punch if you use it promptly when snowfall occurs.","The SJ620 isn’t the most lightweight of our electric snow blower lineup, but it can still remove upwards of 650 pounds of snow each minute. The weight of the device comes from its 13.5-amp electric motor that you can turn on and off with the flip of a switch. Fortunately, the auger blades pull this snow thrower along in a gentle forward motion, reducing the amount of effort and strength you have to put into pushing the machine along.","The engine powers the auger to clear up to 18 inches of space at a cut depth of 10 inches. The speed of the auger spinning allows it to discharge snow through the chute up to a distance of 20 feet. The auger blades are made from a firm, yet gentle rubber that will not mar the surface below the snow. The controls to start the SJ620, run the auger and rotate the discharge chute are located all within reach of the handle. Unfortunately, the handle does not allow you to adjust it to your height.","While the snow blower works best on freshly fallen, powdery snow, it can still make quick work of heavy snow. However, with settled or hard snow, you should expect the discharge chute to clog on occasion. Despite this minor nuisance, this is still superb snow removal equipment if you don&#39;t want to spend too much."]},"id":"18814335-5791-49ad-824c-c1f3334ba5d0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bc11fe7a-dee1-4b76-9714-00e14d3c048e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Snow Joe is a name commonly associated with reliable and durable equipment that can stand up against even the heaviest of snowstorms.
