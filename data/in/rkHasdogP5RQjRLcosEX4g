Features packed into running machines include cool interactive elements, as well as a host of connectivity options and built-in workouts and training plans. ","With most gyms offering banks of running machines, why splashout on one at home? If running is your only interest, they can be  solid investment, giving you years of use, while the fact it’s at home means you’re more likely to hop on it before work or when you’re back, rather than having to venture out to a gym. Having a running treadmill at home also means you can use it even when the weather doesn’t permit a run outdoors.","That said, a treadmill is a major purchase, and pricing is an important consideration. You can pick up a low-end machine for under $100, and top-of-the-line models can nearly $10,000.

Some even offer interactive training via GoogleMaps, which will allow you to set a route, with the treadmill replicating the terrain to a point (provided you have an incline mode).  ","Purchasing a new treadmill can be likened to purchasing a car,” said Pete Schenk, president of LifeSpan Fitness. “You should purchase based on treadmill capabilities first and foremost. Whatever attractive features are built in should be viewed as a bonus.”","Schenk also said many first-time buyers are swayed by a feature or two and are then disappointed when the treadmill needs repairs just a few months down the road. "]},"id":"b496c1b7-928f-4302-ad0b-acb12f346e29","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Gn9Su2UWvUwP5yTjBvpQ5A.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/treadmills/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9aL1UvODE3NzcwL29yaWdpbmFsL1RyZWFkbWlsbHMtVGVzdGluZy0wMDEuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gn9Su2UWvUwP5yTjBvpQ5A.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Gn9Su2UWvUwP5yTjBvpQ5A","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gn9Su2UWvUwP5yTjBvpQ5A.jpg","alt":""},"id":"85a67d7a-99e3-4e14-bbde-7a83ac0fa4da","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>How much should you spend on a treadmill?</strong>","Treadmill price points are driven by many factors. These include the quality of the treadmill’s design components, its durability, the type and size of its display and the features of its console. You’ll want to think ahead about how much you can afford to spend and where you want your money to go. For example, if the stability of the machine is what matters most to you, you might not need to spend additional money on an upgraded console. However, if connectivity is your priority, you might be willing to pay more for a larger screen and more features. As you determine your budget, we recommend paying more attention to engineering and technology than to brand names. Also, making a larger upfront investment may save you repair and replacement headaches in the future.","“In this industry, no manufacturer has the luxury of over-pricing their treadmill options,” said Brant Brooks, Etail account manager at LifeSpan Fitness, “so you get what you pay for, so-to-speak, in respect to build quality. While budget models may look attractive from a price standpoint and may work for a very casual user, an owner will likely run it into the ground within a year or two with moderate to heavy use.”"]},"id":"67a10723-41e1-4608-b87a-c527a3538aa7","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/qfUHaC7rsKzVpqf8tLRYpN.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"<strong>Performance</strong>","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/treadmills/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9aL1MvODE3NzY4L29yaWdpbmFsL1RyZWFkbWlsbHMtSG9yaXpvbi1FbGl0ZS1UNy0wMi1UZXN0aW5nLTAwMS5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfUHaC7rsKzVpqf8tLRYpN.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"qfUHaC7rsKzVpqf8tLRYpN","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfUHaC7rsKzVpqf8tLRYpN.jpg","alt":""},"id":"ff5c2d21-f7da-4080-a189-c96ac8ced64d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you want to get the most out of your treadmill, you’ll want to consider the size of its running surface, the quality of its belt, the cushioning of its deck and the power of its motor. It’s also important to determine how many people in your household will use the machine, how intensely each person exercises and how console features and technology can help you achieve your fitness goals.","In recent years, improvements have been made industry-wide to make home treadmills more energy efficient, durable, useful and enjoyable. From making advancements in the stability of folding treadmills to adding workout tracking, Bluetooth compatibility, and Wi-Fi connectivity to consoles, manufacturers are responding to consumer needs.","“One recent technological advancement that is forging the future of in-home fitness is the inclusion of live workout classes and friendly competition via social-active apps such as RunSocial,” said Brooks.","This trend to integrate with <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/482-best-fitness-apps.html?_ga=2.152146553.1771547323.1526925201-19531800.1519921344\">popular fitness apps</a> is enhancing the performance not only of the best treadmills but also of the <a href=\"/best-elliptical-machines\">best elliptical machines</a>. Whether you’re hoping to lose weight, improve your cardiovascular health or reduce stress, home fitness equipment is becoming an increasingly popular tool to help you reach your goals.<br/><strong><br/>Safety Features</strong>","It’s important to make sure the treadmill you buy has an automatic shut off feature of some kind. This means the treadmill will abruptly stop running if you lose your footing or need to stop your workout for any kind of emergency.","The automatic shutoff feature on most treadmills is controlled with a small plastic key. In order for the machine to run, the key has to be inserted in a slot on the front of the treadmill, usually toward the bottom and under any kind of interactive screen. The key is connected to the treadmill by a string so that when pulled, the key slides out of its slot causing the whole thing to turn off. The key’s location is important because you’ll be able to grab the string and stop the machine if you fall forward. When installing it, make sure you leave enough loose string hanging to get your hand around. If for any reason you lose your treadmill key, you can buy replacements at numerous stores or through Amazon. They usually cost less than $10.","Even with a safety key, make sure there is plenty of open space around your treadmill. If your treadmill randomly shuts off for no apparent reason, this is unrelated to the safety features and usually means there is a problem with the treadmill&#39;s belt not being able to move smoothly.","Some treadmills also have an automatic pause function. This means if you step off the treadmill at all for a given period of time – usually less than a minute – the machine will pause the belt. We can see this being useful if you have to hop off quickly to grab something off the stove or keep your family pet from eating something important. Still, you should always try to shut off the treadmill yourself before walking away even for a moment.<br/><strong><br/>Best running apps for treadmill workouts </strong>","All the treadmills we tested come with built-in workout programs, but if you grow tired or need some extra motivation from certified trainers and professional runners, a running app is a better option. The best mobile applications have workouts specifically designed for treadmill running.  ","<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nike-run-club/id387771637?mt=8\">Nike+ Run Club</a><br/>This app has more than 50 guided runs and six workouts specifically designed for treadmills. The treadmill workouts last 15 to 30 minutes and include audio instructions, pace and incline settings and tips from Nike running coaches. Each workout is paired with a custom music playlist if you sync a Spotify or Apple Music account. Additionally, all the training and tracking features are available for free on iOS and Android devices.","<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/peloton-digital/id792750948?mt=8\">Peloton Digital</a><br/>You don’t need an expensive Peloton treadmill to take advantage of this running app and its vast library of exercises. Unlike Nike Run Club, this app requires a monthly membership fee of $19.49, but it has more than 175 treadmill running classes that range from 10 to 60 minutes. In addition to the treadmill workouts, Peloton Digital also has more than 10,000 on-demand exercises, including strength training, yoga and floor workouts. If you are looking for some external motivation, this app has a wide variety of virtual instructors with more than 15 new exercises added daily.","<strong>Best fitness trackers for treadmills </strong>","The best treadmills we tested have chest-strap and pulse-grip heart-rate monitors. If you want more accurate readings, workout archives and personalized fitness feedback, a wrist-worn fitness tracker is the best solution. Here are some of our favorite fitness trackers that cost less than $150.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvosmart-Activity-Fitness-Tracker/dp/B0%E2?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Garmin Vivosmart 4</a><br/>The Vivosmart 4 tracks heart rate, blood oxygenation and sleep patterns, and it has a unique Body Battery feature that tells you your body’s optimal active time and when you need to rest. The rechargeable battery lasts up to seven days on a single charge or five days with the Pulse Ox sleep-tracking function enabled. This fitness tracker’s design is a little boring compared to other wearable devices from Garmin. However, it has a slim silicone strap that’s comfortable and available in four color options. Unlike the Fitbit fitness trackers, the band on the Vivosmart 4 is permanently attached to the sensor, so it’s impossible to customize.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FTN21JL?th=1/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Fitbit Charge 3</a><br/>The Charge 3 automatically begins monitoring your activity when you start a treadmill workout and sends your heart rate and calories burned to the Fitbit app or other popular fitness apps, like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal. The touchscreen is simple to use and has a backlit display that’s easier to read than those on smaller trackers like the Vivosmart 4. This fitness tracker has customizable clock faces and swappable bands that make it an attractive accessory.","<strong>Treadmill Maintenance </strong>","Like any piece of machinery or technology, it’s important to keep your treadmill clean and working properly. Start small with daily cleanings. Wipe down the treadmill every day after you use it to prevent any moisture buildup on important electronics. Then, check the walking belt and deck once each week. Make sure it&#39;s running centered without any snags, and listen for any scraping sounds. You should also vacuum the area around the machine, if possible. If dirt and dust build up on the floor, it could migrate to the delicate mechanical parts at the base of the machine and cause problems. Every month, double check the bolts, and make sure the treadmill frame is secure. If you notice any strange noises or the machine feels shaky when you run, stop immediately and check the bolts.","Large scale maintenance only needs to happen once a year. We recommend vacuuming the motor compartment carefully to remove built-up dust and grime. Don&#39;t touch any mechanical or electronic parts with the nozzle of the vacuum. You should also lubricate your treadmill once each year. Keep the manual on hand, and consult it if you need to, as you might just need to restart the machine.","If the electrical components of your treadmill start glitching, it&#39;s time to call a professional or the company you ordered the machine from. If you keep experiencing problems with the treadmill’s computer components, it’s most likely a larger problem you won’t be able to fix yourself.","<strong>Read more: </strong>","<a
