You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Sennheiser is a German company represented in the United States by the wholly-owned subsidiary, Sennheiser Electronic Corporation. They are known for making high-quality professional and personal audio equipment, including microphones, assisted listening devices, communication headsets and <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">stereo headphones</a>.","The Sennheiser HD 448 over-the-ear audio headphones are a mid-level entry in Sennheiser’s HD product lineup. These are really good, affordable full-size stereo headphones that Sennheiser says are optimized for use with MP3 players and other portable devices. We found in our testing that the stereo headphones performed well with a variety of different portable devices and other sound sources at good volume levels.","The stereo headphones weigh only seven ounces and are comfortable to wear. The closed-back design offers some isolation and blocks out enough ambient noise that you should not need to turn up the volume to have a pleasant listening experience with these stereo headphones. When we did turn up the volume we found that the sound leaked out and could be heard by those around us.","The ear cups are large and fit well around the ear. There is enough padding to offer a comfortable fit, but the leatherette pads don’t breathe and you may find that your ears will get hot and start to sweat after extended use.","The HD 448 headphones have a frequency response of 16 Hz to 24 kHz. This means that they are capable of reproducing tones that are too low and too high for the human ear to hear. Some songs use subsonic and supersonic tones to add more presence and warmth to the bass, and to add more clarity to the treble. Even though you can’t hear these tones, you might be able to notice a difference if you use headphones that can’t reproduce them.","The overall balance of these stereo headphones is very good, but the bass seems to be a little weak. It is possible that if you give them a chance to break in the bass will eventually become more pronounced. If you like your music to be bass-heavy, you might be a little disappointed. If you like to listen to classical or acoustic music, these stereo headphones are the best.","These stereo headphones come with a 4.6-foot cable, which is just about the right length for portable applications. The cable is not too long to get in your way, and it is not so short that you feel tethered to the sound source. It comes with a 5.2-foot extension cable and a quarter-inch adapter so you can use them while watching TV or listening to your home stereo."]},"id":"2fb02978-ecd9-4ada-8ec1-ff85e91a8e84","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"19bdf618-a86c-440a-8737-839ac63da207","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The lightweight design and comfort of these stereo headphones make them suitable for wearing them on the road or on public transit – if you don’t mind how you look while wearing big, full-size headphones in public. The sound is balanced and well suited for classical, jazz and acoustic music. They also perform very well when driven by portable devices. The Sennheiser HD 448 are excellent headphones in the under $100 price range, but be sure to read our other reviews to find the pair that is best for you."]},"id":"e21f4273-a247-43a2-90ee-96f96681d026","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50441","url":"/sennheiser-hd-448-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-16T19:14:13Z","datePublished":"2010-08-16T19:14:13Z","name":"Sennheiser HD 448","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":81,"verdict":"Very good headphones with great sound that won&#039;t break your budget.","pros":["Well-balanced sound suitable for all types of musical genres."],"cons":["Can get hot and uncomfortable after extended use."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-08-16T19:14:13Z","id":"MaTb2WnKu2TWzLVVB6Ze2D","meta":{"title":"Sennheiser HD 448 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Sennheiser HD 448 stereo headphones deliver well-balanced suitable for all types of musical genres.
