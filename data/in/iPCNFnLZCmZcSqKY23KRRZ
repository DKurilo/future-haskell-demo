We fired up each microwave and tested them on commonly-prepared items like popcorn, pizza rolls and potatoes. Microwaves that cooked food completely and evenly got higher scores than those that left cold spots or burned spots. We also looked for units that have food-specific buttons that work well and a wide selection of power levels, so you can be specific about how your food is cooked on each cycle.","Convenience<br/>Most countertop microwaves come with a Quick Cook function, also known as Express Cook, which makes microwaving food even faster. The 30-second key is also a time-saver because you can simply add 30 seconds to the cook time as your food is cooking.","Sensor cooking is a newer feature that&#39;s only available on a few countertop microwaves. With this feature, you press the reheat button and sensors measure the steam that emits from your food to determine when it&#39;s done, so that it cooks for just the right amount of time.","The preset buttons can also be time-savers. The most common are <a href=\"/best-popcorn-makers\">popcorn</a>, potato and pizza. Other preset buttons that microwaves sport include ones for a beverage, fresh and frozen vegetables, a frozen entree, soup, and bread.","Warranty &amp; Support<br/>One of the most overlooked pieces of information in your user manual is the warranty, and some microwave manufacturers offer a longer warranty specifically for the magnetron. Many manufacturers give you an all-encompassing warranty that covers all parts for the same amount of time – for instance, Kenmore offers two years of protection from defects.","Dimensions &amp; Power<br/>The right balance between a small countertop footprint and adequate cubic footage inside can be tough to work out. We were pleasantly surprised by how much the smaller units could fit so we generally recommend getting the smallest one that makes sense for your household. However, the smaller units tend to have less overall power.
