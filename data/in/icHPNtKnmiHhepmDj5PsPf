The original review is below, but check out our current top</em><i> </i><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/laundry/best-front-load-washers/\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Maytag Maxima MHW5100DW isn’t quite as sleek-looking as some of the other products in our front-load washer reviews, but it has a lot going for it. This machine has eight wash cycles and five pre-wash options, which by itself doesn’t sound all that impressive when compared to the other product in our lineup. It may not have a plethora of options, but the ones it has are impressive.","The capacity is great at 4.5 cubic-feet. This is big enough for all kinds of loads. It is also an energy-efficient washer. As it is ENERGY STAR qualified, this Maytag front-load washing machine has total operating costs estimated at $28 per year. The ColdWash cycle also helps conserve energy.","This washer has an internal water heater, which is an uncommon feature that gets out tough stains by adjusting the temperature during the cycle. Protein stains, like blood, dairy products and mud, get the cold water treatment they respond best to, while other stains and dirt get hotter temperatures in the same cycle. The water heater-enabled PowerWash cycle works at removing tough stains with extra cleaning power and a thorough rinse. The machine also has an allergen cycle, which can remove up to 95 percent of common household allergens and pet dander that often gather on clothing and other fabrics. Unfortunately, there is no prewash option. This is not to be confused with preset options, such as delay wash, which are available on this washer. This washer also lacks a steam option.","You also get a National Sanitation Foundation-certified sanitize option with this washer that helps remove up to 99.9 percent of household bacteria. This front-load washer is 38 3/4 inches high, 27 inches wide and 32 15/16 inches deep. The optional pedestal drawer is available for an extra cost.","This is one of the more affordable front-load washers in our lineup, and it is backed by an impressive warranty. The parts warranty is fairly standard at one year, but the motor and washtub each come with a 10-year warranty. You can receive help and support from Maytag by phone, email and even a convenient live-chat function on its website. Maytag also provides the product user manual and some FAQs on its website for your reference."]},"id":"cc16814b-5142-44dd-b667-1c39a53d5530","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"92dcacdb-f728-4db8-80ca-7d2f4f0db7a5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maytag Maxima front-load washer is an ENERGY STAR-qualified appliance with a 4.5-cubic-foot washtub.
