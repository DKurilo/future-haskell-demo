Rather, the warranties are stipulated by the retail partner, such as Big O, Tire Kingdom and others. This can make it difficult to compare with other brands because each retailer has different stipulations. Still, Cooper has 21 tire performance series covered under its tread-life warranty. The average mileage on these series is 56,500 tread-life miles. The best of these warranties, the CS5 Grand Touring (T Rated), has a mileage of 80,000 miles. This is slightly below-average for a high-mileage warranty. Many tire brands have warranties peaking at between 90,000 and 100,000 miles.
