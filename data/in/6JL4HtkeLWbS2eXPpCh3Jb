Clicking the Buy button will take you to this version for purchase. The manufacturer lists the new version as offering the following features: mount and search ISO discs and automatically resize video files to highest supported quality. We will evaluate, rank and review Power2Go 11 Deluxe when we next update the Blu-ray to Blu-ray Copy Software reviews. Meanwhile, enjoy our review below about the CyberLink Power2Go 10 Platinum.</em>","CyberLink Power2Go is a <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-to-blu-ray-copy-software\">Blu-ray copy software</a> application that allows you to make exact disc copies of your CDs, DVDs and Blu-rays. The program has an intuitive, simple-to-use interface that walks you through specific functions step by step. Unfortunately, this program lacks the power to decrypt commercial Blu-ray discs, so you can&#39;t create safe backups of your Blu-ray collection for personal use.","When you first open the program, you are directed to a welcoming, uncomplicated screen in which you can choose a function. In addition to copying Blu-ray discs, you can create audio CDs, burn video DVDs, create data discs, back up your media online, burn a recovery disc and so on. For these reasons, CyberLink Power2Go ranks among the best media backup software. However, the program&#39;s Blu-ray copying options are more limited.","One of the most important functions of any Blu-ray copy program is its ability to bypass the antipiracy encryptions found on commercial discs. Power2Go lacks this feature, which means that you won&#39;t be able to copy or back up the Hollywood movies you own. As Blu-ray collections are a serious investment, it is ideal to create backup discs for your personal use so you don&#39;t have to repurchase discs in the event of damage or loss. If you need a program with decryption capabilities consider our top pick: <a href=\"/blue-cloner-review\">Blue-Cloner</a>.","For discs that you can copy, this program is simple and easy to understand. After selecting which function you wish to perform, such as copying a disc, you are prompted to insert your disc(s) in a drive. At this point, you can adjust some settings, such as the number of copies you wish to make, and when you are ready, you click &#34;Copy.&#34; At this point, all you have to do is sit back and let the program do its work.","Making a disc-to-disc copy with any Blu-ray copier is time consuming. Depending on the size of the disc, the processing speed and your Blu-ray drive, it can take anywhere from two to four hours to make a new copy directly from a disc. This is due to the sheer size of files contained on a Blu-ray. If you plan to make more than one copy, don&#39;t use the disc-to-disc copy option.","For making multiple copies, we recommend you extract the Blu-ray&#39;s disc image (ISO file) onto your computer&#39;s hard drive. You can then use it to burn as many copies as you wish without the time-consuming process of reading, extracting and writing a new disc image for every new copy. You can also use the ISO file as a virtual disc and watch it on your computer&#39;s media player as though it were the original physical disc.","If you run into any problems, you can contact the company via email or search the online FAQs. The website also includes video tutorials and a user guide, both of which are very informative."]},"id":"51402f30-1a89-4e32-bd0f-f451ae28db88","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b1c20f97-efcc-4cc0-93ea-fa3fea0da88c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["CyberLink Power2Go is one of the best Blu-ray software programs for backing up your personal media.
