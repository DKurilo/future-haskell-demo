The Klipsch Synergy C-10 center speaker is one of the ten best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1286-best-center-speakers.html\">center speakers</a> we reviewed. The center channel speaker is the most important element of a home theater system because it is responsible for the main dialogue of movies and the lyrics of music. Even though the frequency response isn&#39;t as impressive as some other audio products, the C-10 still offers quality sound in a lightweight and compact design.","This 2-way model features one tweeter and two woofers. The dynamic 0.75-inch tweeter is made with an aluminum diaphragm. This driver is set in a Tractrix Horn structure, which projects the sound forward in concentrated waves. This adds additional clarity to the high frequency sounds. The magnetically shielded 4-inch woofers handle the low frequencies.","The Klipsch Synergy C-10 center speaker has a frequency response of 100Hz to 23kHz. This is a narrower range than many of the other center channel speakers in our review. It is unable to hit the low tones, but most everything below 80Hz is produced by the subwoofer anyway. This model is also unable to create the supersonic tones that are sometimes put into audio mixes to enrich the sound.","The recommended amplifier power for this Klipsch center speaker is 50 to 200 watts. Anything below 50 watts may not produce quality audio sound. However, the C-10 can handle up to 200 watts without any damage. This is one of the highest peak wattages we found in our review. This product is more resistant to permanent damage from accidentally turning up the volume too high.","One of the most impressive aspects of the C-10 is the sensitivity. Sensitivity is the measurement of how much power is required to produce a given volume. A higher number means less power is required to get good sound. This center speaker has a sensitivity of 93.5dB. This is the highest sensitivity in our review. This means you can pump up the volume and you won&#39;t be drawing a lot of power and you won&#39;t hear static in the background.","This unit measures 6 inches high, 16 inches wide and 5.25 inches deep. It also only weighs eight pounds. The lightweight design of this center speaker makes it easy to mount on the wall or rest on top of your television or entertainment center. The black ash vinyl sealed enclosure also features a single pair of binding posts on the back."]},"id":"821d50fe-9023-4b1e-86d0-ae3eb964850a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c5d91d2e-3270-4848-bc7e-0f5615c18624","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If your home theater is suffering from unintelligible dialogue or the soundtrack drowning out the music, purchasing a new center speaker, like the Klipsch Synergy C-10, can help. This model is able to play at high volumes without distortion or static. Some of the lower tones may be lost in the transition between this center channel speaker and the subwoofer, but the higher frequencies are perfectly projected through the Tractrix horn design. This high-quality audio device can offer clear and detailed sound. There are better options available, but most users will be quite happy with this center speaker."]},"id":"21a0b91d-00f9-4491-8e53-5e4ed754d732","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50513","url":"/klipsch-synergy-c-10-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-knoder","url":"/author/jonathan-knoder","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jonathan Knoder","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"yRHneGGUztMrGu99zxra6M","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-25T22:47:02Z","datePublished":"2010-08-25T22:47:02Z","name":"Klipsch Synergy C-10","synopsis":"Klipsch has been making quality audio equipment since 1946.
