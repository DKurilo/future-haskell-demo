You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The AGPtek Wireless Backup Camera is a <a href=\"/home/auto/best-backup-camera\">rear-view camera</a> with excellent resolution, night visions and an affordable price tag. It comes with a rear-view mirror monitor that replaces your current rear-view mirror.","The camera attaches unobtrusively to your license plate. It connects to a transmitter that sits in your trunk and broadcasts wirelessly to the monitor. When you shift your car into reverse, a 4.3-inch screen appears on the mirror.","The camera has a field of view of 92 degrees, which is a bit narrower than you get with some of the other backup cameras we reviewed. It&#39;s possible you&#39;ll miss activity on the edges of the field of view that you would pick up with another camera.","The AGPtek has infrared night vision, so you can see a black-and-white video of what&#39;s behind you at night. It also offers distance scale lines on the video, so you can know how close an object is to you by the color-coded lines.","It has a wireless broadcast range of 160 feet, which is one of the strongest signals among wireless backup cameras. However, it broadcasts an analog signal on the 2.4GHz frequency, which means this system is prone to interference from Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth devices and other wireless transmissions. Some competing cameras have digital signals, which are less subject to interference.","This reversing camera has a waterproof rating of IPX8, which means it can be submerged without incurring any damage. One of the weaknesses of this camera is its difficulty of installation. Because the monitor is built into a rearview mirror, you&#39;ll have to run the power cord for the mirror up through the headliner and down into the console area to connect it to a power source."]},"id":"2c733b19-865b-4974-8841-e9cb45737ad2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"85f61804-517f-4065-be47-92d82cc70831","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The AGPtek offers a nice set of features at the manufacture&#39;s price point.
