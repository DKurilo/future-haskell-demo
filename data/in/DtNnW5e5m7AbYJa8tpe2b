The video converter&#39;s editing features are very basic compared to other products on our lineup. The entire capability of this software can be summed up in two steps – open file, convert file.","It does a fine job of this, but our other video converter software contenders do this job in addition to many others. Also, if you are ready to invest in this type of software, you probably want a product that can handle as many file types as possible so that it will be useful for years to come for a wide range of projects.","We give this quality software credit for being easy to use, but a big part of that in this case is having so few features that there is not that much for you to master – just open, convert and repeat.","Using Cucusoft, you will be able to convert videos from a collection of formats that includeH.264, MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, RM, 3GP, FLV, SWF, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, VideoCD, SuperVideoCD and DVD, as well as audio formats like AC3, AAC, MP2, MP3, MP4, RA and WMA. We love to see audio formats listed. That adds a layer of usefulness to the software, but again, we saw more variety in other products.","You can use Cucusoft to convert your videos to more than 120 different profiles. They&#39;re split into the categories: iPod, iPhone, iPad, Zune, Apple TV, Game Device, Mobile Phone, Portable Media Player, HD Video, Flash Video, DVD/VCD/SVCD, Common Video and Common Audio.","You can contact the manufacturer by email if you have any questions. Cucusoft also has an informative FAQs section and user guides available on its website."]},"id":"c72d0b8d-fe29-4786-9c97-9c834aad22bd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cbb05572-0aa5-4b0f-bca4-6655bc7b4f21","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Cucusoft converts video files to a lengthy list of output profiles and file formats, but the list of files it can convert from is less impressive.
