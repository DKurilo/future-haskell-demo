This <a href=\"/software/multimedia/best-blu-ray-to-ipad-converter-software/\">Blu-ray to iPad ripper</a> has an enormous feature set that includes simple and advanced video conversion tools. It has various options that include the ability to extract audio and to create tracks or chapters with the downloaded videos. Also, there are file-merging options that allow you to combine more than one file. You’ll love how simple it is to get started with this application.","When we first started to use the Aimersoft Blu-ray to iPad converter, we were impressed with all the different features it offers. We went on to test the basic and main features of downloading, or ripping, and converting video files using this application. Its CSS decryption tool allowed us to download even copyrighted content for the purpose of backing up our videos. By doing this, we were able to start moving videos from Blu-ray boxes to our iPad. Along the way, there are options to help you create the videos and to create chapters and tracks. The organizational tools are phenomenal.","The advanced capabilities of this Blu-ray to iPad converter are quite impressive and include all kinds of audio-extraction and file-format options. However, the software can be slightly overwhelming for first-time users. It’s slightly less simple to use than some of the other best Blu-ray rippers we reviewed.","When you are downloading and converting videos, time and quality are very important factors. If you can’t preserve the high quality of videos on Blu-ray Discs, what’s the point of having a Blu-ray to iPad converter or the tablet&#39;s high-resolution screen? The slight discoloration we noticed on some of the videos after conversion with this Blu-ray to iPad converter was small, but detectable nonetheless. We did not always see the discoloration, but the gray-like film would occasionally rare its ugly head. This is only a small problem we noticed and is not always present, however."]},"id":"2366da9e-2ac9-43c9-bcf6-65a162d30a14","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7411714c-45bc-450c-89b9-6966c06e6363","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Aimersoft Blu-ray Ripper is one terrific piece of software.
