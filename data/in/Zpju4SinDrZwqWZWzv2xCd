Unlike other systems we reviewed, the satellite speakers don&#39;t have typical +/- connectors located on the back of the speaker. Instead, they have a specially made connector unique to this system. All of the speaker connectors are color coded so you know which speakers go where in your home. All of the satellite speakers then connect to their assigned ports on the bottom of the subwoofer. Then, the subwoofer output connects to the receiver with a special speaker bundle of speaker wire. You can&#39;t use regular speaker wire to connect any of the satellite speakers to the receiver, nor can you use any of the satellite speakers without the subwoofer. The entire process to connect this system to our receiver was a bit of a hassle.","Since this system still connects to the back of the receiver with normal speaker wire, it can be compatible with other home audio equipment. For example, if you already have two floor standing speakers, you can use the Bose 5.1 system to turn your home theater system into a 7.1 setup. Just make sure that your receiver can support 7.1 audio channels. ","<strong>Center Speaker Specifications</strong>","This system does not feature a center speaker.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong>","Bose includes a one-year warranty on the subwoofer unit and a five-year warranty on all of the speakers.
