While versatile, the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-action-cameras,review-3046.html\">life camera</a> does not come with a built-in strap, so you have to purchase a holder separately.","With 1080p recording at 30 frames per second or 720p recording in slow motion, the RE Camera has HD video quality that is good enough for display on large-screen TVs. The handheld life camera is also capable of capturing still photos at 16MP, which produces print quality photos. It has a 146-degree wide-angle lens, allowing you to capture close ups with ease, and it also works with selfies, taking group shots and photos or videos of landscapes.","This wearable camera is waterproof, and you can shoot video up to 3 feet underwater. This makes the camera a good option for filming while snorkeling, in swimming pools and while participating in water sports. Time lapse and regular photos both sync wirelessly to your phone so that you can share them immediately.","The smooth exterior of the RE Camera is easy to fit into one hand, which makes it comfortable to use and carry around. There is one button on the device that you tap once for a photo or press once to shoot video but with no other buttons, you have to use the RE app for other camera adjustment. You can also use the app to take remote photos using a tripod or when using the camera on a mount.","A nearly two-hour battery offers enough use to record some of a day trip, party or some sporting events. However, with no interchangeable battery, it is not suitable for longer events or adventure sports where you need more battery life. The battery charges via a Micro-USB cable.","While the RE Camera does not feature a strap for use as a body camera, you can purchase a clip that attaches to backpacks, collars and harnesses. It also works on helmets, bicycles and car windows with other accessories you can purchase separately.","The microSD card slot supports up to a 32GB card, allowing you to store significantly more video than you can record at once with the battery. You can also swap cards out easily if you do run out of room.","While not a sports camera, the RE Camera has valuable features and functions, including waterproofing, a wide-angle lens and a one-handed design, that make it a good fit for families and parents who want an easy-to-use camera for outings, vacations and adventures."]},"id":"c4afd8a9-9ecf-4f35-8992-dc87cde6c37e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64260","url":"/re-camera-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-21T19:35:09Z","datePublished":"2015-04-21T19:35:09Z","name":"RE Camera by HTC","synopsis":"The RE Camera from HTC shoots HD video, is waterproof and has a 110-minute battery.
