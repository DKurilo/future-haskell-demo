Even in the case of a car accident or other emergency, pinpointing your exact location will be easier for emergency workers than when you are wandering the wilderness.

This unit offers many different ways to reach each target destination. You choose which one is best for you. If you select the ecoRoute, you will be taking the most fuel-efficient path. You can also select the shortest-distance route, an off-road route or the fastest-time route. You can also select the route that will help you avoid certain highways or toll bridges. The choice is always up to you.","You can further personalize this unit by saving up to 1,000 favorites and up to 100 routes. These are your specific stopping points and favorite paths.

At all important intersections, arrows will mark clearly the best lane for reaching your destination.","This navigation GPS unit also listens with its advanced speech recognition. You can offer spoken commands like &#34;find address&#34; to start important processes rather than taking your hands off the wheel to type and search manually.","Garmin gives you access to six million Points of Interest – stores, restaurants, hotels, gas stations, ATMs and more – and street maps for the U.S. and Mexico.","Most Garmin navigation GPS units come with an option for photo navigation, which guides you to anything you see in a geo-tagged photo. Think sightseeing gems such as Union Square in San Francisco or Times Square in New York City.","This navigation GPS unit comes in at a fairly steep price point, but one of the things you are paying for is lifetime traffic and map updates. You will have updated maps for downloading four times a year, and traffic info is updated constantly. Unlike lesser navigation GPS receivers, these features are all available right out of the box so you don&#39;t have to subscribe to anything or purchase updates all the time, saving you time and trouble.","This system offers a lot to anyone in the big city – any big city. As you explore a new town or your town on foot, you will be able to use Nuvi 3790LMT to get information about where to find a bus, subway, tram or other transportation. You can get full transportation schedules and find out how long it will take you to get from your hotel to the theater, for instance.
