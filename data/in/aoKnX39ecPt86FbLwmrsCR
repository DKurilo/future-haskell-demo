You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you are looking for a <a href=\"/best-electric-toothbrushes\">rechargeable toothbrush</a> that comes with all the bells and whistles, look no further than the Pursonic S450. This deluxe electric toothbrush provides conventional brushing plus supplementary features that can leave your teeth feeling extra clean. The S450 costs more than most electric toothbrushes on the market, but is the extra features can make it well worth the price.","Although its cost may seem steep, this rechargeable toothbrush comes with a dozen extra brush heads and bonus functionality you won’t find with other power toothbrushes. When you factor in the cost of additional brush heads, the S450 is actually comparable in price to other electric toothbrushes. The toothbrush also comes with a UV sanitizer. The base for the brush contains a sanitizing chamber that can hold up to four brush heads. When you turn on the sanitizing feature, a UV bulb in the chamber can kill up to 99 percent of bacteria on the brushes. Some people feel you can just as effectively sanitize brush heads on your own, but this is a feature to consider if hygiene is of the utmost importance to you.","Another useful feature of this power toothbrush is its three speed settings. You can choose between normal, soft and massage, whichever pressure level feels the most comfortable to you. According to some users, the massage mode is particularly beneficial if your gums are prone to sensitivity; users say the brush can effectively but gently clean the surface of teeth in this mode.","Two minutes is the recommended time for proper and adequate brushing. The Pursonic S450 has an option for extended brushing time should you want an even deeper and more thorough cleaning.","While the initial price of the Pursonic S450 may give some potential buyers pause, it pays for itself over the long run. You won’t have to buy any additional brush heads for three years, assuming you replace the head every three months as Pursonic recommends. Additionally, its sanitizing feature gives you the peace of mind that your brush heads are always hygienic, and its three speed settings ensure there is a comfortable brushing mode for you."]},"id":"ab9409b0-e57e-489a-ade9-68a1b6f19881","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59542","url":"/pursonic-s450-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-16T14:53:33Z","datePublished":"2014-05-16T14:53:33Z","name":"Pursonic S450","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
