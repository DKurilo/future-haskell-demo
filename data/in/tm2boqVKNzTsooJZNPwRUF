Even though our panel enjoyed the TV&#39;s picture, there were a handful of visual flaws that were produced. As the camera pans across the starry sky in &#34;Gravity,&#34; we noticed some streaking in the stars. This shouldn&#39;t happen. Stars should remain dots in the sky instead of streaks on a chalkboard. We didn&#39;t notice any haloing around well-lit objects against dark backgrounds, which is an issue with the majority of the cheap smart TVs we compared. The absence of haloing issues is a good indication of strong contrast abilities and good backlighting from the display.","The movie &#34;Mad Max&#34; is almost exclusively filmed in the desert so all of the visuals are of bright skies and brilliant orange sand. The Hisense naturally has a bright and vibrant picture quality to it, so as we watched &#34;Mad Max&#34; some of the scenes looked grainy (no pun intended) and not as sharp as &#34;Gravity.&#34; In this case, the naturally vibrant coloration of the TV worked against the Hisense.","Finally, we tested the TV with Calman software to get a reading on the color accuracy and contrast ratio. According to our testing, the Hisense has one of the highest contrast ratios among the TVs in our lineup. A strong contrast ratio means deeper blacks and better-lit bright spots. This makes for better overall picture quality. For color accuracy, the 55H5C ranked right in the middle of our field. While the coloration of the TV looks vivid, it&#39;s not as natural or accurate as other televisions when set to movie mode.","After taking all of this into account, the overall picture quality is better than the majority of cheap TVs we reviewed.
