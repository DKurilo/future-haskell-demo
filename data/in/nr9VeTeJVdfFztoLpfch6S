HDTV antennas like the HomeWorx HW210AN allow you to access local channels for news and sports, as well as hidden virtual channels, for a one-time cost, as opposed to monthly fees. The HomeWorx antennas are surprisingly powerful and get great reception quality, although it is hard to find troubleshooting help from the actual manufacturer. Nevertheless, this antenna is one of the best in terms of pickup quality and range.","Indoor HDTV antennas are devices you can easily install without having to climb onto your roof. The HomeWorx HW210AN is convenient to install as it comes with a detachable 10-foot coax cable. It’s not the longest in the business, but it does give you a lot of room to move the antenna around. Since the cord is detachable, you can purchase a longer cable and attach it to this antenna if you need more cord. Aesthetically speaking, the design is ultra-thin. The antenna is only 1.5 mm thick and is lightweight and durable. It has a black and white side, and the white side can be painted over to match other color schemes you may want.","This HomeWorx antenna not only has one of the best signal pickup ranges among indoor antennas, but it also has some of the best pickup quality. In our tests, this antenna picked up most of the channels in our area and the channels came in crystal clear. It is impressive that this small and thin indoor digital antenna has such a powerful signal range.","We looked for HomeWorx’s website and could not find one that looked reliable. This means it’s hard to find anyone for troubleshooting or for customer service and support. Third-party retailers offer industry standard one-year warranties on this digital antenna though."]},"id":"72415783-4c40-4ddb-a967-05309ffaf91e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"818ee1fc-6c56-4739-914c-94680ba91ba2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HomeWorx HW210AN is surprisingly powerful.
