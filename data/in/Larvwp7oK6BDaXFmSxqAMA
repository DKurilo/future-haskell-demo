People have made careers out of creating gameplay videos and posting them to YouTube. Live streaming is becoming more popular as time goes on. Gamers like to watch other people play games, and you, too, can create gameplay videos or stream. What you need is some <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-free-gameplay-recording-software,review-4657.html\">game recording software</a> and access to YouTube or a live streaming service. You&#39;ll also need to make sure that your computer is up to the task.","Just about any gaming computer can record gameplay videos with the right settings, but to create high-quality, professional-looking videos, you&#39;ll need a gaming PC close to the high end. Keep in mind, your PC has to run the game beautifully before your videos can look beautiful. Capturing that beauty and saving it to a hard drive can be hard for computers to do. You don t want the recording or the game capture software to create lag in your game, so you need to make sure your hardware can handle it.","Let&#39;s look at the three most important parts of computer for live streaming and video game recording:","<strong>CPU</strong><br/>I think it&#39;s clear that the most powerful CPU you can get is the best option, but let&#39;s take a look at what else will handle recording and live streaming. For the highest-quality recordings, you&#39;ll want nothing less than an Intel i7 processor. All i7 processors are quad-core, and they all use Hyper-Threading. The key here is Hyper-Threading, which means the operating system has two logical cores for each physical core. Therefore, a quad-core processor with Hyper-Threading looks and acts like an eight-core processor in regards to the operating system.","With an i7, your PC will handle multiple tasks simultaneously better than any i5. In effect, recording your game and running the game at the same time will consume a smaller percentage of your processor&#39;s power, creating a smoother experience. A slower processor or one without Hyper-Threading is liable to cause lag in your gameplay when recording the highest-quality videos.","<strong>Hard drive</strong><br/>If you don&#39;t set things up right, you can easily bottleneck your system as your hard drive (HDD) tries to write too much information. When recording gameplay, you should have at least two hard drives   one should have the operating system and the game recording software installed on it, and the other should only be used to save recordings. Trying to keep everything on one hard drive will result in slower performance and drops in the recording&#39;s frame rate.","There are several colors, or classes, of hard drives, and they are all suited to different tasks. For video game recording, you should have a Black hard drive. Keep in mind that the Black series will consume considerably more electricity than its Green and Blue cousins. However, the tradeoff is worth it because you also get increased performance and better read/write speeds.","You may want to consider using a solid-state drive to record to. Technically, an SSD will outperform an HDD every time. But there are a couple of things to keep in mind. SSDs are still somewhat expensive per gigabyte, and video game recordings of high quality take up a lot of space. Also, constantly writing to an SSD with large amounts of data will degrade its condition more quickly than an HDD, so don&#39;t expect the SSD to last as long.","<strong>Video Card</strong><br/>Mostly, you want a video card that can make your games look as good as possible. The best video cards are out of most people&#39;s reach, so we&#39;ll take a look at the minimum you&#39;ll need. You shouldn&#39;t go any lower than the GeForce GTX 650 Ti or the Radeon 7770. These cards will run most games on high settings with 1600 x 900 resolution. If you want to record higher resolutions, then you&#39;ll want to look at better video cards.","Recording video games and live streaming can be hard on your PC, so make sure that your components are solid. Think of it like this: If your PC can&#39;t run the game on the highest settings with game recording software or live streaming, then you&#39;ll have to record and stream at lower quality. Many people appreciate high-quality videos, and you don&#39;t want to alienate them with pixelated sequences or unexpected frame-rate drops. Live streaming and recording is fairly complex, but if you learn the basics, it&#39;s not too hard from there on out."]},"id":"d76fb6fa-9068-4927-a30a-17e4aaf15ae6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8294","url":"/video-game-capture-and-live-streaming-can-your-pc-handle-it","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"kyle-rollins","url":"/author/kyle-rollins","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Kyle Rollins","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"GdUbdwhSh8EfhiDybZ79To","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-12T16:17:23Z","datePublished":"2014-02-12T16:17:23Z","name":"Video Game Capture and Live Streaming: Can Your PC Handle It?","synopsis":"The last five years have seen a rapid rise of video game-related recordings on the internet for various purposes.
