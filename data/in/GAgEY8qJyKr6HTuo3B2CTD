Your back has pressure points, which are made up of numerous nerves all in one location. You can manipulate these pressure points in a variety of ways including acupuncture and acupressure with a professional, but one more affordable option is a back massager. If you have a back massager, try applying pressure where your spine meets your shoulders. This spot is a commonly stressed pressure point. Another pressure point to stimulate is located on either side of the spine in line with your elbows. This spot can be easily reached with massagers that reach down the back. If your massager doesn&#39;t have much reach, try the pressure point below the armpits at the side of the back.","It’s important to listen to your body while performing a massage on yourself. If you feel something is too painful, stop what you’re doing and talk to a doctor or licensed massage therapist. The same goes for giving massages to your family and friends; it’s important to communicate about the appropriate levels of pressure and whether something is painful.","Neck and back massagers let you soothe tight muscles, which increases the overall quality of your life.
