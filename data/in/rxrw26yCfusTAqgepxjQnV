Unlike Credit Karma and H&amp;R Block, it can’t import your W-2, which is a useful feature would save you time.","TaxAct offers a free version for basic returns using the 1040EZ and 1040A forms. If you have a home or want to maximize your deductions and credits, you’ll use TacAct Plus, which costs $27 to file. Self-employed filers should use the Freelancer version which costs $39. TaxAct Premium, which costs $51, includes the features of all the other versions plus audit protection. State returns cost $37, which is among the highest prices we saw.","We tested TaxAct Plus and found it relatively easy to use. The interface is simple and navigation is relatively easy, though it doesn’t highlight the most important parts of your return the way other programs did.","The best feature of TaxAct is its review and alert system. Once you’ve completed your return, before you file, it will show you errors and omissions and even make recommendation about where you can add a deduction or credit to improve your return. Red alerts are problems that will prevent your return from being completed, yellow alerts are small problems and green alerts are recommendations to improve your return.","You can import a previous year’s return, which saves some time as you won’t have to enter all your personal information. The lack of a W-2 import is disappointing. Being able to upload your income information saves time and prevents errors from manual entry. Other programs, like <a href=\"/hr-block-review\">H&amp;R Block</a> and <a href=\"/liberty-tax-review\">Liberty Tax</a> let you import your W-2.","Once you’ve completed your return, you can pay an additional $39 for audit protection. With this service, a TaxAct expert will respond to the IRS on your behalf if you’re audited. Audits are rare and usually only happen if you have a complex review.","You can get your refund through direct deposit, a check or a prepaid card. Direct deposit is usually the quickest way. Checks can take several weeks to arrive. Prepaid cards can have additional fees, especially if you use out-of-network ATMs."]},"id":"6d063cc3-a1ec-4bb4-b9c3-542d6a19ff95","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9b44226b-7a02-4373-ac48-10f969f63391","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TaxAct is a solid tax program, with very good tools for spotting errors.
