Not surprisingly, as much care and attention to detail was put into Knox as went into 1Password. Knox couples Mac file encryption tools as well as backup features into a security utility that is truly versatile.","Knox utilizes OSX&#39;s native Mac disk utility to create protected disk images. These images are what Knox calls its virtual vaults. This technology is the foundation of Apple&#39;s own Mac file encryption application, FileVault. Knox incorporates this capability into its own software and gives you a great deal of freedom to encrypt and decrypt the files you feel you need to protect, at your leisure.","Knox can create an unlimited number of virtual vaults to encrypt files on your Mac hard drive, each with its own password. This is great for people who want to encrypt different types of data. Probably the most important thing to encrypt on your computer is personally identifying information such as tax information, credit card and banking statements, and addresses. You can organize these categories however you want.","Another benefit to being able to assign different passwords to different secured vaults is that it gives you greater freedom to grant access to individuals who may need the data you encrypt. For example, you may want to send all your financial data to your accountant for tax time. To do so, you simply create a vault with all the necessary information, send it to the accountant and then call him with the password. He can then open the vault without having to install Knox on his machine. This is great because some other Mac encryption services require that the software be installed on a machine in order to decrypt the data.","One of the best aspects of Knox is that it gives you the option to make the contents of your encrypted vaults searchable in Finder. This means that even in their encrypted state, you can find the information you&#39;re looking for, but in order to access it, you need the password to that specific drive."]},"id":"f20b37ae-ad32-45f1-adad-6d44505d8519","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f0945223-361e-4f57-8008-a2e52d5071e3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Knox is a nice Mac encryption utility that harnesses the technology already available on Macs to create powerful, intuitive and secure Mac encryption software.
