Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The HP LaserJet Pro CP1525nw is a sleek color <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a>. With a handsome design and an adequate feature set, this printer will get the job done without any difficulty. The design and display of this laser printer are highlights of the device, but it also features ePrint, allowing you to print directly from wireless devices.  Duplex printing capabilities and an adequate size of installed memory also contribute to the overall performance of this product.","The CP1525nw offers 600 x 600 dpi (dots per inch) resolution. The images printed on this printer aren’t of the highest quality possible on a laser printer, but we didn’t notice any blurry documents or poor print jobs. This laser printer also offers a 30,000 monthly duty cycle, meaning the printer can produce nearly 30,000 printed pages per month without causing any technical damage to the printer. However, this number of pages is low for a laser printer, particularly if you are looking for a printer for an office environment.","The printing speed of the CP1525nw is disappointing. This laser printer prints black and white documents at a speed of 12 pages per minute, while color documents print at a speed of eight pages per minute. These are both slow compared to several similar devices, and this speed can be troublesome if you are looking to print large, multi-paged documents. There are duplex printing capabilities available on this printer. While the driver support that allows you to print on both sides of the same sheet of paper is provided, you will have to manually reverse the paper to take advantage of this feature.","One of the standout features available on the CP1525nw is the ability to ePrint. This allows you to print documents directly from a mobile device such as a laptop or cell phone. To use HP ePrint, you email your documents to the printer. This feature gives you wireless capabilities unique to ePrint-enabled printers. This printer also has Airprint capabilities which allow you to do the same thing, but from an Apple device such as an iPad or iPhone.","The paper trays on this laser printer can hold up to 150 sheets of paper. This is lower than several similar devices, and if you are constantly printing, you may find yourself frequently restocking the trays. There is 128MB of installed memory available and a one-year warranty. The CP1525nw consumes a measly 295 watts of power and it is an ENERGY STAR qualified device.","We were impressed with the design and display of the CP1525nw. This printer features relatively small dimensions for a laser printer. It is only 15.7 inches wide, 10 inches tall and 17.8 inches deep. It weighs 40 pounds, which is a little large if you plan to move the device from one area to another regularly. The control panel for this printer is located on the right-hand side of the device and only contains a few buttons and controls. This makes the printer easy to use and control."]},"id":"bab7d1af-9d13-4dc9-ad35-4f319d8c609f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0ae7ac9e-826f-407e-9caa-d8b2e726be2d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP LaserJet Pro CP1525nw is a color printer with a few unique features to share.
