For example, if your home Wi-Fi reaches your garage or driveway, it updates automatically. With every other detector I&#39;ve reviewed, you must remove the radar detector and take it inside your home and connect it to your computer via USB port to update the firmware.","<strong>Alerts</strong>","The best alert feature is the over-speed alert. Using the GPS, the radar detector alerts you when you&#39;ve exceeded a speed limit, which you can adjust from 20 to 160 mph. If you&#39;re a habitual lead foot, you need this feature. Law enforcement has several methods of measuring your speed and issuing a speeding ticket without using radar. Detecting radar isn&#39;t a fool-proof plan, but having a device that alerts you every time you&#39;ve exceed a speed limit ensures that you&#39;re aware of your driving.","The next best alert feature is the directional arrows. Few radar detectors provide any spatial awareness of the radar&#39;s location. With arrows telling you the direction the signal is coming from, your spatial awareness is improved. It also makes it easier to spot when an alert is from a false source, like a motion detector.","When you receive an alert, the Max 360c beeps for a second and then a voice tells you what radar band is detected. You can see the strength of the signal in a bar graph. Unlike most radar detectors that beep incessantly until you hit the mute button, these alerts are loud for only a few seconds before automatically lowering to a quiet volume. even when a source is muted by the GPS, you still get visual alerts, reminding you that radar is in the area."]},"id":"873a45bf-3baa-4d5e-a1f0-6b98100c4325","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e366ed7e-121c-40cc-a223-7027c6db326c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Escort Max 360c is the pick for the best radar detector overall because it does everything better.
