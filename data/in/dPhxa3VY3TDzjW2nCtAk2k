Researching high-quality, affordable options, we selected hair dryers for our review priced between $17.99 and $155. If spending closer to $200 is in your budget, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Drybar-Buttercup-Blow-Dryer-Official/dp/B00BIGARH6?tag=ttr_hair-dryer-20\">Drybar Buttercup Blow Dryer</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Elchim-3900-Healthy-Ionic-Dryer/dp/B007RNYA36?tag=ttr_hair-dryer-20&amp;th=1\">Elchim 3900 Healthy Ionic Hair Dryer</a> are excellent options.","Whatever their listed price, you can often find blowers for less at retailers like Wal-Mart, Target and especially at Amazon.com, but you’ll have to do some price shopping to get the best deals. At the same time, several experts we interviewed told us you can justify splurging on a hair dryer because more expensive models will help your hair stay healthier. You can also expect a more expensive model to last longer. While a hair dryer priced under $30 may burn out after just a few years, a hair dryer priced above $100 should last at least five to 10 years.","Wattage &amp; Heating Technology<br/>A hair dryer’s power is determined by its wattage. We tested blowers ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 watts, and experts recommend choosing a device with 1,800 watts or more for the best results, especially if you have thick hair. Salon models often have 3,600 watts. This higher power comes with a much higher price tag, but it can cut drying time in half. This is important because less exposure to heat results in less damage to your hair. Also, higher-wattage dryers typically last longer.","Heating technology also plays a role in protecting your hair, and you’ll want to choose the technology that works best for your hair type. Ceramic and tourmaline technologies are good for controlling and distributing heat and work well on curly or fine hair. However, tourmaline is not recommended for thin hair. Ionic hair dryers speed drying time and combat frizz. They are recommended for damaged and thick hair but aren’t as effective if you’re looking for volume, lift and movement. Nano technology infuses hair with moisture and provides far-infrared heat. It dries hair faster with minimal damage by penetrating the hair shaft from within. Thermal technology provides constant heat, even heat at every setting. While titanium heat works well on thick, heavy hair, it’s not recommended if your hair is prone to damage.","Features &amp; Accessories<br/>All the hair dryers we tested have multiple heat and air speed settings, along with the following accessories and features:"]},"id":"c2dd4313-8719-4134-b834-4c061e288930","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Concentrators direct air to a focused section of your hair to provide faster drying times and help with straightening.","Diffusers are used to distribute air flow and can reduce frizz and define curl.","Cool shot buttons provide a blast of unheated air to help seal the hair cuticle and set your style."],"type":"ul"},"id":"a780695c-c252-4d93-b1c2-f27861e92618","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Some hair dryers come with additional accessories like straightening combs, quick-dry nozzles and sectioning clips. Other things to look for include removable end caps and air filters for easy cleaning, longer cords for more mobility and a good weight balance for comfortable handling. We also recommend considering the placement of control switches and buttons and getting a feel for your preferred grip type.","Temperature<br/>Some hair dryers have multiple heat settings, and you should pick the temperature you use based on your hair type and the style you&#39;re trying to achieve. It&#39;s import to use the correct temperature to limit damage to your locks. You should use the lowest heat setting possible if you have fine hair, as it&#39;s more prone to breaking. Breakage becomes even more of an issue when fine hair is heated up. Even if you have really thick hair, you most likely shouldn&#39;t use the highest heat setting available. When drying your hair, slow and steady is the best way to go.","<a href=\"https://www.haibeautyconcepts.com/blogs/news/what-heat-level-to-use-for-your-hair-type\">HAI Beauty Concepts</a> recommends using heat up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit for fine hair. You can use a hair dryer as hot as 400 degrees Fahrenheit on average hair, and if you have particularly textured or thick hair, you can up it to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. If you’re unsure how hot your hair dryer gets, check the instructions or packaging. You should also be careful about how hot your hair dryer is when storing it. Give the dryer a minute or two to cool down before letting it come in contact with any sensitive or flammable surfaces.","Most hair dryers also come with a button that shoots a blast of cold air when pressed. According to the <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hair-dryer-guide_n_4316330\">Huffington Post,</a> this button should be used once your hair is about 80 percent dry. Using the cold air seals the hair cuticle and makes the final look last longer and shinier. That way, you can get your hair completely dry without frying it.","Warranty &amp; Support<br/>The hair dryers in our review have warranties ranging in length from one to four years, with two years being average. If you need customer service, most companies offer email and telephone support, and some offer live chat as well."]},"id":"c2093b47-8ef9-48d1-8feb-811c4803807d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"9d5e392a-f250-4f3c-aa26-209a7fbff109","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/remington-review\">Remington -
