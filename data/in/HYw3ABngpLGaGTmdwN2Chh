It produces very good home surveillance cameras with nighttime video quality that&#39;s on par with the best <a href=\"/home/smart-home/best-wireless-home-surveillance-systems/\">home surveillance systems</a>. However, the installation, particularly internet connectivity, can be difficult if you&#39;re not familiar with changing advanced settings on your router. The customer support options from Samsung Techwin are decent.","In our tests, Samsung Techwin&#39;s daytime video clarity was excellent close to the camera, poor at 10 feet and very good past 20 feet.

The home surveillance cameras record excellent video close to the camera and at a distance of 20 feet. At 10 feet, the video quality is a little lower, and at 30 feet, the video loses much of its effectiveness. There was almost no graininess in the nighttime video, which made it easy to spot a person&#39;s face up to 30 feet from the camera.","The Samsung Techwin system in our review supports up to and comes with four cameras. The NVR has a 1TB hard drive. While the controls are about the same as other systems in our comparison, the installation process was difficult.
