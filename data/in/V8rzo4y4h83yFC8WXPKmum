One of the factors that makes Grammarly the best choice for an online grammar checker is how easy it is to use on different web apps and even in Microsoft Word. Unlike other grammar checkers, the application isn’t intrusive, and it appears in texts boxes online. Many of the other programs I evaluated made it hard to accurately identify the problem text, but Grammarly’s red underlining is easy to see and clearly marks where the error is.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/49540-grammarly21.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/44TaBgnVKf28TKnPo6uZR.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"44TaBgnVKf28TKnPo6uZR","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/44TaBgnVKf28TKnPo6uZR.jpg","alt":""},"id":"b079a849-0672-4ee9-9c39-90b7ef9f1018","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When you’re in a text box, you need to click an icon at the bottom to get Grammarly to pop up so you can see details about corrections that need to be made. The site then redirects you to a suite where you can read the text in your email or message with more details and helpful input from the checker.  There’s a short lag while the software analyzes your content, and it adds a few extra steps to your writing process. However, Grammarly’s helpful and correct suggestions trump the slight delay.","The service has an online hub where you can manage all its settings. You can compose and save documents within Grammarly if you’d like, and you can also install an application on your phone to check your writing on the go.","While I think Grammarly functions much better than its competition, its price tag is a little much. It costs just under $30.00 for the premium version every month. While I like sending my documents without typos, that’s not a small chunk of change for a beefed-up version of Word’s editor.","The cost of the service is lower when you pay upfront for longer periods of time. The annual plan is the best deal if you can handle parting with $139.95 upfront. You can switch to any of these plans whenever you’d like, so I recommend trying the monthly version for a while before committing to the quarterly or annual plans."]},"id":"be6d8d79-ef0b-4f34-be33-f7ef9bd23494","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Customization"},"id":"c4a5a73c-49f7-462e-8829-d20cd511d718","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Grammarly lets you select American or British English, and you can select a writing genre.
