It has preloaded maps of the USA and Canada with lifetime map updates. You can also purchase maps of foreign countries from Garmin&#39;s website.","The GPS has free traffic alerts, so you can check road conditions directly from the device. Its traffic receiver is built into the device, so you won&#39;t have to waste cell phone data looking up road conditions.","It uses NavTeq maps with 10 million built-in points of interest. Garmin currently offers more points of interest than either of its two main competitors. One of the best features of the Garmin map interface is its 3D maps. These make a significant difference when you&#39;re trying to navigate in a city, because tall buildings are much more recognizable on a two-dimensional map than they are on a three-dimensional map.","Like several of the GPS units we reviewed, the Nuvi 68LMT has a speed limit indicator. You can see both your speed and the speed limit of the road you&#39;re using. It also has the ability to reroute you around traffic, so you can find alternative routes to your destination when your preferred route is congested.","The 6-inch color screen is capable of being oriented either vertically or horizontally. It has a resistive touchscreen, which means it&#39;s a bit less responsive than a premium navigation GPS that has a smartphone-style capacitive touchscreen.","The Nuvi 68LMT&#39;s biggest weakness is that it lacks voice-activated navigation. Unlike with a smartphone, you can&#39;t command the GPS verbally; instead, you&#39;ll have to type in your destination.","This device has a one-hour battery rating, so you can unplug it only briefly to charge something else.  Like all navigation GPS units, it gets its power from a cigarette lighter adapter.","Garmin has exceptional customer service. We&#39;re impressed with the knowledge of the Garmin reps we speak to. The Nuvi 68LMT comes with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"a3be40cc-c69b-418d-b75d-74641f2c1b9a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1cd3ef23-6741-4607-b934-9c1b6998fccd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Garmin Nuvi 68LMT has everything you need in a car GPS to find your way around, though not everything that would help with convenience.
