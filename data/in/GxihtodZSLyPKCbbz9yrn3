Thanks to a Worx-patented tool-free chain replacement device and auto-tensioning system, the device requires minimal maintenance from the operator. The simple design and ease of operation make this an ideal choice for anyone who doesn’t think they need to be a lumberjack to operate a chainsaw."]},"id":"e12bc713-a42f-4617-9c78-9ab1343aa3ea","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/7amQmpRhGjzYimoY5cwBUW.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56686-worx-wg3032.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7amQmpRhGjzYimoY5cwBUW.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"7amQmpRhGjzYimoY5cwBUW","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7amQmpRhGjzYimoY5cwBUW.jpg","alt":""},"id":"021406f2-30fc-4ede-bc9a-edc651ebf520","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Operating on a 16-inch chain and 14.5 amp engine, the Worx WG303 differentiates itself with added stability during cutting. It comes equipped with a 6.75-ounce oil reservoir with an exterior oil level indicator for ease of monitoring. While a common complaint among consumers is that the oil provided with the initial chainsaw is much thinner than needed, acceptable oil types can easily be found in most hardware stores.","The device comes equipped with a sprocket on the bar nose to help lubricate and preserve the life of the chain. This, combined with its automatic chain lubrication, helps ensure the chainsaw will continue to run with ease for prolonged cutting projects. Because this is an electric chainsaw, you don’t have to worry about mixing oil and gas to get through those periods of difficult start-ups. Simply plug in, pull the easy-start trigger and you can start cutting.","Because it&#39;s an electric chainsaw, the Worx WG303 is lightweight and easy to use over prolonged periods and for maneuvering. The saw is well balanced and cuts fast, though it offers a quick stop when the trigger switch is released. This, combined with a chain break, allows for a much quieter sound than you would have on a gas-powered two-stroke engine.","Worx Yard Tools is known well for the ergonomic and eco-friendly nature of its products, and the Worx WG303 is no different. This device is ideal for light- to medium-duty cutting tasks, whether it’s tree pruning or cutting firewood. Its low price tag, combined with the Worx reputation, means this chainsaw is hard to ignore. The electrical power cords may restrict the range of this device, but it is still a powerful device that meets the need of many tasks."]},"id":"47db1179-09d2-4cca-b64a-e7c4d479d904","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56714","url":"/worx-chain-saw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
