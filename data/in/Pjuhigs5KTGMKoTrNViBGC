The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-turkey-fryers\"><em>Turkey Fryers here</em></a><em>.</em>","Masterbuilt makes several indoor and oil-less turkey fryer models, but the company also makes a high-quality outdoor option, the Masterbuilt Propane Fryer. This is your basic, no nonsense turkey fryer. It includes a 30-quart stainless steel stockpot that sits atop a propane burner. This cooker is large enough to fry a 20-pound turkey.","It takes a lot of oil – at least 3 gallons, typically – to do proper outdoor turkey-frying, and you need a lot of heat to get it going. This Masterbuilt set comes with a 35,000-BTU burner that can keep the oil at 350 to 375 degrees throughout the cooking process. One of the advantages of an outdoor turkey fryer over indoor electrical models is generally you have enough heat to compensate for the drop in oil temperature that the relatively cold turkey initially causes. The sooner the temperature recovers, the more likely you’re going to end up with that legendary golden skin at the end. This powerful burner can keep the oil hot. Masterbuilt also includes a long thermometer to help you monitor the oil temperature.","Masterbuilt provides an aluminum basket and a wide lifting hook to aid in getting the turkey into the oil. The unit also has an electric timer with auto shut-off to help prevent the turkey from overcooking or the oil from overheating. Like other turkey fryers, this unit can also be used for boiling or steaming your favorite foods for cookouts.","One thing that sets the Masterbuilt Propane Fryer apart from cheaper models the spigot on the front of the unit which the company calls the Turkey Tap. This feature allows you to safely and easily drain away the oil once it has cooled and makes cleanup much easier than it would otherwise be.","Most of Masterbuilt&#39;s product line includes electric or oil-less cookers. However, for the traditional outdoor turkey-frying experience, the Masterbuilt Propane Cooker is a great choice. You&#39;ll get great results for your next backyard cooking adventure, from an established brand."]},"id":"9be428f5-3fa9-491d-944a-7f3e3cf0deb4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60081","url":"/masterbuilt-propane-fryer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-29T17:00:55Z","datePublished":"2014-07-29T17:00:55Z","name":"Masterbuilt Propane Fryer MBTF30","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
