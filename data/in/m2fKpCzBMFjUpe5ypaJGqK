This is also true if you let it sit for too long without water and without using it. We made sure to rinse the brew head when we were done testing and noticed a buildup of coffee grounds, so it’s a good idea give the machine a good cleaning once a week or more often, depending on how often you brew espresso. You need to empty the coffee puck bin after several shots.
