The extreme proliferation of these external devices has crowded our desks and computers with hundreds of cords and far too few available ports. To solve this problem, all you need is a convenient USB hub. These compact connectivity solutions allow you to connect several additional devices through a single slot by adding multiple extra ports. Leave behind the days of swapping out devices when you need another port by plugging in one of these useful products.","<strong>USB Hubs: What to Look For</strong>","USB hubs are simple devices with basic constructions and limited features. However, there are a few key aspects that go into the high-quality products that we ve collected for this comparison. In addition to the cost of the devices, it is important to consider the features of the hub itself, the overall durability of the product and the customer service backing each device. We ve considered each of these factors in our reviews, delivering to you all of the information you will need to purchase the best 7 port USB hub for your needs. Among the standout devices are the hubs provided by <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-usb-type-c-accessories-cables\">Belkin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-usb-type-c-accessories-cables\">Tripp Lite</a> and <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-usb-type-c-accessories-cables\">Cables To Go</a>. For additional information on these devices, take a look at our <a href=\"/electronics/computers\">articles on USB hubs</a>.","<strong>Hub Features</strong><br/>In this category, we looked at how many additional USB ports the best powered USB hub added and whether the slots were backwards compatible with USB 1.1 devices. We also looked to see if each device came with a cable to attach to your computer or whether you had to buy your own, as well as if the device included a power adapter for connections that require greater power output.","<strong>Durability</strong><br/>A USB hub that adds several ports but can t handle the extra load is useless. Under this criterion, we rated the hubs on the durability of their construction and how well they supported multiple devices. Some products overheated easily and others broke without much pressure, causing them to rank lower in our comparison.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>This criterion rates the products on how thorough their customer service is. Several of these USB hubs offer lifetime warranties, guaranteeing their products against failure for the duration of their use. Other devices are more limited in their guarantees, providing only a few years of insurance while still others only offer one year of protection. We looked for documentation on the products in the form of a user manual and an online FAQs section. Live chat, email support and a dedicated telephone line were also factors considered in our rankings.","If you re on the hunt for a way to clear up the cable clutter on your desk, pick up one of our highly ranked USB hubs. With our research to prepare you, you will soon be ready to organize all of your peripheral devices with one easy-to-use hub."]},"id":"c7ba5aa2-dc28-422c-abc0-6f0c1b7ef249","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"16be99cb-728b-492c-9c3f-7dcf12a7ff58","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ESN9GA/?&tag=ttr_usb_hub1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|665[art|NA[pid|50973[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Belkin</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVEH6I/?tag=ttr_usb_hub1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|665[art|NA[pid|50974[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Tripp Lite</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product//?&tag=ttr_usb_hub1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|665[art|NA[pid|50975[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cables To Go</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QXDNBS/?&tag=ttr_usb_hub1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|665[art|NA[pid|50976[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">iHome</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007RB280/?&tag=ttr_usb_hub1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|665[art|NA[pid|50977[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">IOGEAR</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028Y4EZI/?&tag=ttr_usb_hub1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|665[art|NA[pid|50978[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Syba</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KUQ8FG/?&tag=ttr_usb_hub1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|665[art|NA[pid|50979[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cables Unlimited</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IWOB4U/?&tag=ttr_usb_hub1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|665[art|NA[pid|50980[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sabrent</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007B5OWRY/?&tag=ttr_usb_hub1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|665[art|NA[pid|50981[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">i-rocks</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A4AW8Q/?&tag=ttr_usb_hub1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|665[art|NA[pid|50982[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">TRENDnet</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"e69d1b6c-0c4d-4651-9508-a161be1ac246","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_665","url":"/best-usb-hubs","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-05T16:05:51Z","datePublished":"2011-09-14T18:07:43Z","name":"USB Hub Review","synopsis":"External drives, scanners, printers: Scores of USB devices clamor for our attention, demanding individual ports.
