It saves costs and also makes intra-organization telephone connectivity faster. Popular PBX phone systems include the <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/rhino/\">Rhino Ceros 3U-IP PBX</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/xorcom/\">Xorcom XR1-12</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/sangoma/\">Sangoma Vega 50 Media Gateway</a>.","Having a PBX phone system reduces not only the cost of calls between members of an organization but also the cost of long-distance calls when combined with VoIP solutions. VoIP PBX allows companies to use a single self-managed network for both voice and data.","<strong>PBX Phone System: What to Look For</strong>","In addition to traditional PBX (circuit-switched) and VoIP PBX (packet-switched) systems, private telephone networks can also use hosted (virtual) PBX systems. Hosted PBX can either be packet- or circuit-switched. A fifth type of PBX is mobile PBX. Mobile PBX replaces some or all fixed PBX phones with mobiles phones. All PBX systems share a common set of calling features, but manufacturers also add advanced features to differentiate their products. Here are the key features to look for in a PBX system.","<strong>Extendibility</strong><br/>PBX phone systems have come a long way since the days of switchboard operators managing interconnectivity with cord circuits. A modern PBX system should come with a rich set of features but must also gain new features with hardware and software upgrades. For example, you can easily add VoIP features to a PBX system with NIC ports. Therefore, a good port selection is important to extending the functions of your PBX system. As long as the system has the hardware support required, manufacturers can easily unlock more capabilities with firmware upgrades.","<strong>Scalability</strong><br/>As the size of your organization grows, you need a PBX system that can accommodate the new employees you add. A scalable PBX system should provide unlimited numbers of extensions, voicemail boxes and auto attendants. In addition, it should be easy to add new phones to the PBX network. Therefore, auto provisioning is an important requirement for a scalable PBX system. Auto provisioning makes it easy to quickly add new users to the network.","<strong>Call Processing</strong><br/>The basic function of a PBX phone system is to establish, maintain and disconnect calls between extensions and from outside lines. Besides these core features, manufacturers of PBX equipment also add different sets of call features. These features include auto attendant, auto dialing, conference call, do not disturb, and find-me/follow-me, as well as call forwarding, blocking, waiting, transfer, park, pickup, trace and logging.","<strong>Extension Dialing &amp; Roaming</strong><br/>Extension dialing is a key feature to look out for in a PBX system. It allows you to call other employees with short extension codes rather than their full phone numbers. Extension-to-extension dialing saves time, just as extension roaming provides true mobility within your PBX network. Extension roaming ensures that you can still receive calls when you are away from your desk. This feature quickly provisions the phone you have with you and routes all communication sent to your extension to the new phone. Extension roaming is especially useful for employees who work from multiple stations or sometimes work remotely.","A PBX phone system improves the efficiency of an organization by making it easy for the members to communicate with one another. Therefore, PBX systems can drive your organization&#39;s unified communications system by linking all voice, video and text communications conducted by the employees. With VoIP and hosted PBX systems, you and your employees can easily telecommute and take part in teleconferences from different parts of the world."]},"id":"d9921fd3-ab73-45c4-9978-bb3337a6f03c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"38c53665-0190-490a-a645-34b0cc41a90f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/telecom-equipment/hosted-pbx-phone-systems/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">ADTRAN</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/telecom-equipment/hosted-pbx-phone-systems/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Audiocodes</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/telecom-equipment/hosted-pbx-phone-systems/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Digium</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/telecom-equipment/hosted-pbx-phone-systems/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Edgewater</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/telecom-equipment/hosted-pbx-phone-systems/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Elastix</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/telecom-equipment/hosted-pbx-phone-systems/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Grandstream</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/telecom-equipment/hosted-pbx-phone-systems/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Rhino</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/telecom-equipment/hosted-pbx-phone-systems/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Rockbochs</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/telecom-equipment/hosted-pbx-phone-systems/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Sangoma</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/telecom-equipment/hosted-pbx-phone-systems/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Xorcom</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"070bfbae-c59d-4ef9-858f-e1a033c14e7c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1554","url":"/best-pbx-phones-and-systems","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"mike-mcpeek","url":"/author/mike-mcpeek","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Mike McPeek","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"zHMn9cGyHw9eJCvSFXXYrJ","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-23T22:40:22Z","datePublished":"2015-05-01T15:55:41Z","name":"PBX Phones and Systems Review","synopsis":"PBX, or private branch exchange, is a private telephone network used within an organization.
