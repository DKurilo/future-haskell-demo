While it is among the more high-priced of medium-duty <a href=\"/best-chainsaws\">chainsaws</a>, it makes up for that in simple added value features.","Light-duty cutting is a cakewalk for this device as it can easily handle pruning trees, but where it really shines is in bringing down a troublesome growth. It has a slim body, high center of gravity and flat underside, which makes it easier to not only maneuver, but to use for prolonged periods of time. The shape of the chainsaw is complemented greatly by its LowVib vibration dampening system. This helps stabilize the moving parts of the engine to reduce engine and transmission vibration, which in turn detracts from operator fatigue."]},"id":"07fbf182-8666-4a99-b038-882eec2e5b7b","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/9ALYE6s9LSfemqXFLGz2DF.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56693-husqvarna-440-e-series4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ALYE6s9LSfemqXFLGz2DF.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"9ALYE6s9LSfemqXFLGz2DF","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ALYE6s9LSfemqXFLGz2DF.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e4d06f6d-0a15-4cc5-990b-d5102ec7c695","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This chainsaw uses the X-Torq Engine On E-Series, technology that reduces fuel consumption and exhaust emission levels. This enhancement allows operators to get longer use out of their chainsaw from the same size fuel tank as other models. The fuel efficiency of the Husqvarna 440 E-Series is aided largely through the air injection system. This complements the already-efficient engine by removing dust and debris particles to prolong the engine’s overall life.","The Husqvarna 440 E-Series comes equipped with smart start improvements, making starting even more of a breeze. Resistance in the starter cord has been reduced by nearly 40 percent over previous models and is complemented by an air purge that further enables quick and easy starting. As a chainsaw ages or goes through a period of disuse, it gets progressively harder to start and thus requires additional pulls on the starter. Husqvarna products age more gracefully than most, ensuring you only ever have to pull the starter two or three times.","The Husqvarna 440 E-Series is a reliable gas-powered chainsaw that promises both innovative features and product longevity. The small technological advances ensure that the device will perform above and beyond expectations and still deliver significant value no matter your cutting needs."]},"id":"0f6a620e-ba8d-4821-b055-cdb7e439e744","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56721","url":"/husqvarna-440-e-series-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
