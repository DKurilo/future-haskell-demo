(What we looked for)<br/></strong>","We’ve been reviewing credit reporting services for nine years. In that time, we’ve seen free services for checking your credit scores become more commonplace. Data breaches and hacks have become a seemingly everyday occurrence. To get more context we spoke to Terry Clemans, executive director of the National Consumer Reporting Association, a non-profit that provides training to professionals and resources to consumers about credit reporting and other financial matters.","Mr. Clemans told us that the credit report, and not the score, is the most important thing to pay attention to. He cautions against agonizing about the score, and instead paying attention to the data on your report, because that data is the only thing you can do anything about. If you change that data, your score will follow suit.","The bureaus weigh the past 12 months of activity highest, so the further back your problems are, the better your credit will look. This assumes, of course, that you’ve taken steps to correct those problems. It’s important to remember that just because something has happened that’s left you with bad credit, that doesn’t mean you’ll have bad credit forever. After three to four years, there’s little impact on your history. The NCRA provides a series of educational videos that give additional information about common credit issues.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We researched each of these companies to see what credit reporting services they offered. We considered how frequently you can view your report. Remember, the Fair Credit Reporting Act entitles you to a free report a year, and if you dispute anything on a report, you get another free report.","We also looked at the tools each service offers to combat fraud. The best allow you to send disputes directly from the service’s dashboard or app. This saves you time and makes what can be an aggravating process much simpler. We also like services that send you alerts about updates to your credit file and especially about new applications for lines of credit in your name.","Due to the recent data breach, we opted not to include Equifax on this update. Currently it’s only offering a basic service that doesn’t have the same scope as the other products we reviewed. ","<strong>How Much Does Credit Reporting Cost?</strong>","There are many free credit reporting services available, but usually you only get access to reports and scores from one or two of the credit bureaus. Many services offer access to all three bureaus for $10 to $30 a month, with many of the more expensive services including ID theft protection on top of credit reporting. By law, you’re also allowed one free credit report from each bureau once a year.","<strong>What Goes Into a Credit Score</strong>","Credit scores can seem mysterious and daunting. But once you learn what goes into making them, they’re not as scary. There are five factors that make up your credit scores.","Payment History: This looks at how on time you make your payments. This makes up about 35 percent of your score.","Amount Owed: The amount you have available on revolving accounts like credit cards is weighed especially heavily. This usually makes up about 30 percent of the score.","Length of Credit History: This is the length of time each account has been opened for and accounts for 15 percent of your score.","Types of Credit: This looks at the types of debt you’ve had and the accounts you’ve successfully paid off. This is about 10 percent of the score.","New Credit: This section of your score looks at new inquiries and accounts. It makes up around 10 percent of your score.","One confusing aspect of tracking your credit is that there are numerous scoring models. FICO is the most common, but even within FICO there are different versions that may be used by lenders for specific purposes. If you’re applying for an auto loan, there’s a specific score the lender will use that’s different from the score a lender looks at when you apply for a mortgage.","There are also educational scores, which are sometimes called FAKO scores. These use the same 300 to 850 scale FICO and other models use, but are calculated differently and may not necessarily be the same score a lender looks at.","If you keep a watch on your credit report for inaccuracies and errors, as well as maintaining good financial habits, you should see an improvement in your scores.","<strong>Experian and FICO Debut New Ways to Improve Credit Scores</strong>","It can be difficult to get approved for a loan or credit card when you have a low credit score. Having a low score isn’t necessarily the result of poor money decisions – in some cases, you may not have a long enough credit history to get approved. Generally, lenders look at how long you’ve had credit cards or loans, so if the accounts on your file are relatively new, you’re less likely to be approved.","FICO and Experian have developed new enhancements to their respective scores that will consider other types of data and help borrowers who may not be approved because they have insufficient credit. ","FICO developed an alternative score it calls <a href=\"https://www.fico.com/ultrafico/\">UltraFICO</a>. This score, which will become available in 2019, is different from traditional FICO scores, which look at your credit history, how much available credit you use and other factors. Instead, UltraFICO looks at your savings and checking history to determine if you’re on sound enough financial footing to get approved.","Once available, if you have a low traditional FICO score, you can opt to have it recalculated with UltraFICO. UltraFICO will look at your savings and checking account to make sure you haven’t had any negative balances and that you’ve maintained an average savings balance of over $400. ","Experian’s new feature, called <a href=\"https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/introducing-experian-boost/\">Experian Boost</a>, is similar. It&#39;s an optional service that allows Experian to look at your utility and other bill payments and include them in its credit score calculations. Like UltraFICO, the aim is to help borrowers with thin credit files who are on solid financial footing get approved.
