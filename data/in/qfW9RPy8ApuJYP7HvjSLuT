Plan pricing has remained the same through the rebranding, but plan features have minor changes.</em>","Owned and operated by T-Mobile, MetroPCS offers customers service on par with Big Four cellular companies for a fraction of the price. It is the best <a href=\"/best-prepaid-cell-phones\">prepaid cellular service</a> we evaluated, particularly for moderate-to-heavy data users and families. All four plans available through MetroPCS are a great value, thanks to steep discounts on additional lines and frequent promotional deals.","<strong>Network</strong>","Because it runs on parent company T-Mobile’s network, MetroPCS has nationwide coverage and impressive data speeds. In fact, MetroPCS outperformed <a href=\"/t-mobile-review\">T-Mobile</a> in certain speed tests conducted by Tom’s Guide, our sister site. In the same testing, MetroPCS had faster average upload and download speeds than other network-owned prepaid carriers, including Sprint’s Boost and AT&amp;T’s Cricket.","Historically, the T-Mobile network hasn’t performed well in rural areas, but with expansion efforts in recent years, it’s seeing much more coverage. Still check coverage and service maps for the places you use your phone most, especially if you&#39;re outside of a city, as the network still performs best in more urban places.","<strong>Plans</strong>","MetroPCS offers four plans, which all have unlimited talk and text, but differ in the amount of available high-speed data. The least expensive plan is $30 a month per line for 2GB of data. The multi-line discount does not apply to this plan tier, so prices are comparable to other budget plans, but it does allow you to use your data allotment for hotspot tethering.","Beyond this simple plan, there’s a 5GB plan and two unlimited options, one with and one without hotspot data. For individual lines, these plans are a good value as they give you plenty of data and unlimited music streaming that doesn’t count against your high-speed data use. For the unlimited options, you can use up to 35GB of high-speed data before experiencing deprioritized speeds. If you need more lines, additional lines two through five come at a great discount. Each line is the same price as lines on the cheapest plan, no matter what plan you choose. So a top-tier unlimited plus hotspot family plan for five people only costs $30 more than five lines on the cheapest, 2GB plan. The value gets better the more expensive the initial plan is. Plus, MetroPCS often runs promotional deals that increase the discounts even more.","<strong>Carrier Features</strong>","Fees and taxes are included in MetroPCS’s advertised prices. This counterbalances the lack of paperless billing or autopay discounts that other carriers offer. You also can’t top up on high-speed data in the middle of the month with MetroPCS, but since the difference between data tiers is $10, it can cost less to upgrade rather than pay for an extra GB of data with an alternate provider.","MetroPCS also has a range of international options, including a $5 add on for unlimited calls and texts to Canada or Mexico, plus 5GB of data roaming. You can also add a Global Voice Unlimited plan, which gives you unlimited talk and text to 13 countries, or the Landline plan, which gives you landline calling to many more countries."]},"id":"313a0944-9e25-4762-96ab-847c98ad8116","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e4c7dc8f-76f1-4038-a31c-7c779132f111","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, MetroPCS is the best prepaid mobile carrier.
