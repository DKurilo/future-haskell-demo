It has a great combination of wash cycles and features. This washing machine offers 12 cycles, five wash options, four soil levels and five temperature settings.","The dozen wash cycles include convenient settings for bulky items and a quick wash cycle for loads you need done quickly. Although this washing machine has a prewash option, it does lack a permanent press cycle.","While the stainless steel tub with a capacity of 3.8 cubic feet is more resistant to picking up odors, it&#39;s still best to clean your washer regularly to remove residue left behind from detergent. This top loader includes a great clean washer cycle for that purpose.","This top-loading washing machine is also quiet. Its vibration control makes it a great option if you need to install it on a top floor or next to a bedroom or high-traffic room.","Since you&#39;re likely going to be using your washer usually a few times each week, the savings of an energy-efficient option build up over time. This top-loading washing machine is Energy Star qualified, with an estimated operating cost of $14 and 135-kilowatt hours of electricity yearly.","The Whirlpool High Efficiency also preserves water with its automatic water level settings. With this feature, you won&#39;t waste water by using more than you need to get your load clean. You also have the option of running your laundry through cold wash cycles, which saves the energy the machine would have otherwise used to heat up water for a warm wash cycle.","Like many other top loaders on our lineup, the one-year warranty for the overall machine isn&#39;t ideal. However, Whirlpool provides you with a good set of options for help and support. You can use the phone number, email form or live chat found on their website. The company also posts the user manual and other material like the installation instructions and energy guide on its website."]},"id":"ba5a0a87-456c-4a9e-b4aa-7438301fc811","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fef65eab-ecce-47cc-a123-014e0e5fb58a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool High Efficiency WTW4900BW is efficient in both its energy-saving features and its variety of wash cycle options and settings.
