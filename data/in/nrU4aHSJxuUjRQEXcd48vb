Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","TurboCAD LTE Pro is a step above its sister LTE version. This <a href=\"/best-cad-software\">CAD drawing software</a> has extra design tools and is well-connected in terms of compatible file formats. Features such as the command line, lighting effects and hatching help you quickly create accurate designs.","This CAD program lets you create lifelike designs. It’s a great advantage to see what your creation will look like before you create a physical model. With TurboCAD LTE Pro, you can use textures, materials, transparency options and lighting effects to fully analyze what your designs will look like off-screen. Photorealistic rendering isn&#39;t completely supported, but you can get close with full rendering.","For buildings and floor plans, the wall tools and house wizard will save you time by giving you the tools you need to quickly create walls and houses. Some CAD programs allow you to animate your designs so you can see them move and interact with environments, but TurboCAD LTE Pro doesn&#39;t have an animation feature. So if you want to use your CAD software to, for instance, show a real-life, animated rendering of how a tractor works for a presentation, this software will not give you the tools to do that.","This 2D CAD software has a layout similar to most Microsoft Office programs, so the navigational system will feel familiar when you are first trying out the program. It has a customizable tool palette so you can customize your workspace to best serve your project. The command line is located at the bottom of the screen so you can type in commands to find the tools you need to finish your design and thus speed up the process. The user interface is easy to use with intuitive toolbars. Importing and exporting various file formats is also convenient, especially if you need to collaborate with team members on designs.","This program has some of the best CAD software editing tools. Snap tools, text editing, color tools and a point marker all make your creations faster and easier to design. However, you won&#39;t be able to convert files from 2D to 3D or from 3D to 2D like you can with similar programs.","One of the best features of TurboCAD LTE Pro is the array of compatible file formats. The two major CAD players, DWG and DXF, are supported along with many others including DWF, DGN and STEP. The DWG format is designed specifically for 2D and 3D drawing. This program will let you create and edit imported DWG files. If you need to email or print your models, PDF and image files are supported too. You can open SketchUp files, SKP, and you can export STL files for 3D printing.","TurboCAD LTE Pro&#39;s publisher, IMSI/Design, provides a wide range of support options. There are email addresses and phone numbers for technical support hotlines as well as social media contact options. A forum, tutorials, FAQs, online help and in-program manuals are all great resources for learning and using the software. Support is also free and unlimited for the most recent versions of the software."]},"id":"d37dd8b8-ee50-4cb7-8793-f6edc1071dae","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7adf88ea-2528-4e9b-9231-de1eee1d184f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TurboCAD LTE Pro might not have all of the tools you&#39;ll need for converting and presenting 2D and 3D models, but it gives you the tools you need to create and edit complex designs.
