While the customer representatives were relatively quick to respond to questions, they aren&#39;t as helpful as some other companies are. This company does provide competitive warranties, but the lack of a PPA agreement option might be a turnoff for some.","Direct Energy Solar operates within Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington, D.C.","We asked this solar contactor if it offered battery storage and were told that it isn&#39;t offered at this time. In addition, it only offers grid-tied <a href=\"/best-solar-companies\">solar services</a>. If you purchase solar panels you will receive a 20-year workmanship warranty, which will cover your roof in case the solar panels cause damage over the years. Depending on the plan you choose, the inverter will be covered somewhere between 12 and 25 years. The solar panels themselves are covered by a 20-year warranty, which is standard in the industry.","When you call Direct Energy Solar, a company representative will immediately evaluate your home&#39;s solar eligibility by looking at an aerial view of your home online. This consultation will also include discussing your electricity bill and learning about your specific energy needs. If the company finds that your home is good to make the switch, it will then work on designing a system specifically for your home. Once the design has been drawn up, a consultant will meet with you to discuss the design, your payment options, warranties, incentives and the guaranteed energy cost of the system. The solar contractor will take care of permits, inspections and other paperwork so you don&#39;t have to. Direct Energy Solar states that installation is estimated to be completed within 90 and 120 days. After installation, your home will start generating power once the utility company gives the OK. From there, the 20-year warranties and 24/7 monitoring will kick into effect.","Direct Energy Solarâ€™s website states that it offers two different agreement options: purchase and loan. The purchase and loan options come with 20-year production, 20-year workmanship warranties and 24/7 system monitoring. This company&#39;s loan requires little to no money down and relies on a fixed monthly payment. The lease/PPA comes with a limited warranty. When we asked about a PPA, the company told us it only offers loan and purchase programs.","The FAQs page has detailed answers to many common questions and will help you feel informed. You can contact the company by phone or email and they will answer your questions quickly, if somewhat tersely. We weren&#39;t able to get as thorough of answers from these customer service reps as we were from some other companies.","If you&#39;re looking for a dependable solar company, Direct Energy Solar is a good option. However, if you were planning on using a PPA to switch to solar this probably isn&#39;t the solar company for you. With only purchase and loan options, agreement plans are relatively limited. In the end, the warranties offered by this company are relatively standard and can help you feel confident about your purchase."]},"id":"dd05b206-3cb7-4df5-8fb6-c7a763f93585","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69376","url":"/direct-energy-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-26T12:40:59Z","datePublished":"2017-05-26T12:40:59Z","name":"Direct Energy Solar","synopsis":"Direct Energy Solar's website is full of information.
