Its maximum effective range is 35 miles, although you have to meet some optimal (and rather unattainable) environmental conditions to attain that range. If you are using an FRS frequency while hiking through the woods or communicating across a campground, you may only get an effective range of a mile from this long-range walkie talkie. The MU350R has access to both FRS and GMRS frequencies, but before you use the GMRS channels, you must have an FCC license.","In our testing, the MU350R’s range was great on the high-power, GMRS frequency, particularly when compared to other models we tested; however, it didn’t do as well on our low-power, FRS frequency test, getting only an average range. Our testers were impressed with the consistency over the GMRS channels. The clarity didn’t take a nose-dive as we increased our distance, like some of the other walkie talkies. This walkie talkie works well over a range of about 1.5 miles on either frequency, but beyond that, especially on the FRS frequency, we found a significant decrease in accuracy and reception.","The MU350R comes with three rechargeable AA batteries, and you can easily swap in new batteries if you run out of power.
