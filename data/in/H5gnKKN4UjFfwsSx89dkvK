ProFlowers recommends cutting 1 to 2 inches off the stems before putting them in a vase. Cut the stems at an angle to improve water intake, and continue this process every couple of days. Use room temperature water in your vase and change it out every two or three days, along with any flower food that came with the bouquet. It might seem counterintuitive, but you should keep cut flowers out of direct sunlight and heat. Don&#39;t display them near fresh fruit either, as fruit releases gases that can kill your flowers faster.","ProFlowers conducted tests with myriad household items that are supposed to keep your flowers alive longer: vodka, apple cider vinegar, hairspray and even bleach. It found keeping flowers chilled in the fridge rendered the best results, along with adding a little lemon-lime soda to the bouquet&#39;s water. The home remedy yielding the worst results was hairspray, so keep the Aqua Net away from your flowers at all cost!","<strong>How we Tested and Found the Best Flower Delivery Service</strong>","We thought the best way to find the top flower delivery service would be to order the same thing from each one. So, we ordered either a dozen or two dozen red roses from each website and scheduled them for delivery on the same day. When they arrived we either left them in their respective vases or unpackaged them from their boxes, noting how they looked and following the instructions that came with each bouquet. All of the boxed flowers came with at least one packet of plant food and instructions to clip about an inch or two off the bottom of the stems before putting them in a vase. The pre-arranged bouquets came with no instructions and no plant food, so we left them alone.","It’s interesting to note here that some of the companies we ordered from got it wrong. Some bouquets we received were short a flower or two, while others sent us 12 even though we had ordered 18. ","After letting the bouquets sit overnight, we then took surveys rating the look and smell of each bouquet, as well as whether they appeared to be worth the price, including shipping and handling. The flowers remained in our lab in the following days as we kept their water fresh and collected data on how quickly their blooms opened. We also waited for how long it took them to die, which to us was when the majority of the blooms were droopy, falling apart and no longer visually appealing.","When it came to fulfilling our orders, we discovered national flower delivery companies that outsource to local florists often don’t arrive as they look on the website. We lowered scores for companies that sent us too few roses, but didn’t hold it against companies that sent us more than the order called for – as long as we weren’t charged for the extra flowers."]},"id":"f5b750d6-1067-4ce0-b60d-914d5ef8fc68","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/8nf7dpkMYhZ4SPnGpFnR7a.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/online-flower-delivery-services/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9OLzUvNzU1MTA1L29yaWdpbmFsL09ubGluZS1GbG93ZXItRGVsaXZlcnktVGVzdGluZy0wNTguanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8nf7dpkMYhZ4SPnGpFnR7a.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"8nf7dpkMYhZ4SPnGpFnR7a","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8nf7dpkMYhZ4SPnGpFnR7a.jpg","alt":""},"id":"dedaddb0-6ecb-4d15-aea1-97a8c5228db6","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Mother’s Day Flower Delivery<br/></strong>","Now is the time to start thinking about the perfect Mother’s Day bouquet.

Shipping flowers across the globe and ensuring they’re kept fresh costs a lot."]},"id":"379e17a3-8043-44b4-9824-608ff8f957da","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/b7V6nzevyaRRSaFRu4VhAV.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/online-flower-delivery-services/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9OLzMvNzU1MTAzL29yaWdpbmFsL09ubGluZS1GbG93ZXItRGVsaXZlcnktT3JnYW5pYy1Cb3VxdWV0LVR3by1Eb3plbi1DbGFzc2ljLVJlZC1Sb3Nlcy0wMDMuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b7V6nzevyaRRSaFRu4VhAV.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"b7V6nzevyaRRSaFRu4VhAV","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b7V6nzevyaRRSaFRu4VhAV.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c2d56ffb-f5a0-413d-b895-b4d14ad4763d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>How to Make your Flowers Last: Tips and Tricks</strong>","Now you know where to go to get the best flower delivery, there are several things you can do to keep cut flowers alive for as long as possible. ProFlowers recommends cutting 1 to 2 inches off the stems before putting them in a vase. Cut the stems at an angle to improve water intake, and continue this process every couple of days. Use room temperature water in your vase and change it out every two or three days, along with any flower food that came with the bouquet. It might seem counterintuitive, but you should keep cut flowers out of direct sunlight and heat. Don&#39;t display them near fresh fruit either, as fruit releases gases that can kill your flowers faster.","Here are some more tips and tricks for caring for a bouquet."]},"id":"68074878-c08e-4a8f-8a7b-54385cc9d6e8","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Fill the vase with warm water when the flowers arrive.

Don’t leave any part of the bouquet zip-tied together; it can damage the stems as they sit and bloom.","Put your bouquet in a place where it gets substantial natural light throughout the day.","Avoid using room spray or any other aerosol chemicals near a bouquet.","Clip off leaves or petals when they die.

Have you ever wondered what that powdery substance actually is? These packets usually contain citric acid, sugar and bleach. This is because a byproduct of photosynthesis is sugars that help the plant grow. Adding a little extra sugar to the water the plant consumes essentially gives the bouquet a little boost. You can make alternative plant food at home with one teaspoon of baking soda, one tablespoon of salt and half a teaspoon of ammonia added to one gallon of water.","<strong>Staying in Season</strong>","It’s easy to stick with tradition and buy roses on Valentines Day, white carnations for weddings and lilies for funerals. However, for better bouquets, we suggest buying based on season rather than tradition. Many of the best flower delivery websites and local florists build amazing floral creations based on whatever is in season. For example, in the fall, you see more sunflowers, mums and greenery. In the spring, there are more daisies, lilies and baby’s breath. Following these trends leads to more luscious bouquets. In fact, if you insist on a certain bloom that isn’t in season, it could look dead or droopy. This also means availability varies depending on where you order from. Trusting the florist to arrange the most beautiful version of the bouquet you order is often the best route to take.<br/>","Some flowers bloom through more than one season.

However, there are a lot of flowers you can get that won&#39;t make people sneeze or give them itchy eyes.","The hydrangea plant is ideal because it comes in a lot of different colors but won&#39;t bother allergy sufferers. Allergens are usually found in a plant&#39;s pollen, so try to avoid flowers that carry a lot of pollen. Geraniums, for example, work well because they have low levels of pollen. Flowers with higher levels you should avoid include daisies, sunflowers and chrysanthemums.","If you know the person you’re buying flowers for is very sensitive and you’re afraid to get anything with a bloom on it, a cactus or succulent is a great alternative. These green plants don’t have any blooms and, therefore, don’t have any pollen, making them perfect for folks with sensitive noses. Note that some breeds of cactus, like the Bunny Ear, do occasionally flower under the right conditions, so do your research before you buy. It’s not as fun as surprising a friend or loved one with a bouquet, but you can always ask what types of flowers and pollen they’re allergic to so that you won’t risk giving them a gift that makes them sneeze."]},"id":"c3400237-35de-4d7e-b71d-5e29fb37eb25","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_253","url":"/best-online-flower-delivery-services","authors":[{"email":"anna.burleson@futurenet.com","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-04-03T14:37:00Z","datePublished":"2019-04-03T14:37:00Z","name":"Best Flower Delivery Services of 2019","synopsis":"We bought flowers from the biggest online florists and ranked them from best to worst based on delivery times, appearance and freshness.","review":{},"strapline":"We bought flowers from the biggest online florists and ranked them from best to worst based on delivery times, appearance and freshness.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-04-04T20:33:04Z","id":"H5gnKKN4UjFfwsSx89dkvK","meta":{"title":"Best Flower Delivery Services 2019 -
