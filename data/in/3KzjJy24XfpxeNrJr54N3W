Sometimes there&#39;s no way to be sure, but often computers give hints that something isn&#39;t right. Check your computer for the symptoms below to make sure it is secure and not at risk from a virus.","<strong>1. Slower Internet and Processing</strong><br/>A slower computer doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you have a virus, but if it&#39;s a sudden enough change in speed, it may be worth checking out. Use a speed test to check your internet speed and use your computer&#39;s task manager to measure processing power. If either seem slower than usual, perform a scan with your antivirus software.","<strong>2. Unexpected Computer Behavior</strong><br/>Viruses can do all kinds of strange things to your computer. If your computer stops responding to clicks, decides to open files on its own, scrolls or acts as if a key&#39;s been pressed when it hasn&#39;t, you may be experiencing computer virus symptoms. Your computer shouldn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s thinking for itself.","<strong>3. Sudden Freezes &amp; Crashes</strong><br/>Because viruses damage your hard drive, they can cause your computer to experience a catastrophic failure. If you&#39;re lucky enough that your computer still turns on after a crash, make sure to run <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">antivirus software</a> to determine whether a virus was the cause.","<strong>4. Error Messages</strong><br/>Your computer knows something is wrong before you do. One of the most noticeable symptoms of a computer virus is the sudden appearance of pop-up messages warning you about missing system or application files. Research messages by putting them in a search engine to see if you can diagnose a virus.","<strong>5. Advertisements</strong><br/>It&#39;s common to see ads as you browse the internet, but if you start seeing them when you&#39;re not actively browsing, that is a telltale sign of a virus. Do not click on these ads, even if they say they are for antivirus software.","<strong>6. Outgoing Emails</strong><br/>Viruses try to spread themselves by email. If you notice emails in your sent box that you didn&#39;t send, you probably have a virus. If you get an email from a friend that seems suspicious, they might have a virus. Do not click on any links or open any attachments in questionable emails.","<strong>7. Missing or Extra Files</strong><br/>Keep track of the size of your hard drive. A virus may install copies of itself or unwanted files on your computer. Viruses also delete files unexpectedly. When you start seeing something strange or missing, it&#39;s time to run a virus scan.","<strong>8. Hardware and Accessory Problems</strong><br/>If you suddenly have a problem with your computer&#39;s display, such as mixing pixels or color problems, this can be a sign of a virus messing with your system. A networked printer may also start acting up if it becomes infected.","Remember, your computer will not always show symptoms if it&#39;s infected. Always perform regular system checks and virus scans to make sure your computer is clean. Also, practice preventive care. Never click on unfamiliar links in emails or pop-up ads to keep your computer safe from exposure."]},"id":"7c22fb04-b6a3-4f7f-9ed0-72b52afe9e7e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9716","url":"/symptoms-of-computer-virus","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-22T16:57:44Z","datePublished":"2015-07-22T16:57:44Z","name":"8 Symptoms of an Infected Computer","synopsis":"Do you know how to tell if your computer has a virus?
