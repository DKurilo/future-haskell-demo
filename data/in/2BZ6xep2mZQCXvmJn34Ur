Characteristic of most cordless keyboard and mouse combos, the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 6000 Keyboard and Mouse combo is no different. But unlike its competitors this wireless keyboard and mouse boast maximized efficiency by creating products that extend battery life. Both the keyboard&#39;s and the mouse’s AA batteries will last more than six months before they will need to be replaced. Battery level indicators are located on each component to alert you with an appropriate amount of time to switch batteries before the keyboard and mouse become unusable.","Before using Microsoft’s wireless keyboard and mouse, included software must be installed. Once in place, this software allows for an array of features to be unleashed. For example, after installing, the mouse will now have a magnify feature that enlarges specific parts of the screen, but our favorite feature is the Flip 3D option on the keyboard. By pressing a specific key on the keyboard or the mouse scroll wheel, a 3D display of all of your open windows will appear, allowing you to shuffle through them. If you’re anything like us, several windows are open at all times, and it can be a pain to minimize and maximize each window searching for the right one. This feature makes it easy (and fun) to find the appropriate window. Customizable hot keys are another convenient feature. Five specific keys can be programmed to bring up folders, programs and even the internet with the push of a button. The keyboard and mouse are connected to the computer via a USB receiver, so if you lose connectivity make sure the receiver isn’t being blocked and is securely plugged in."]},"id":"96853458-6e2f-4225-9e43-5a25399b99c1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Mouse Surface Accuracy"},"id":"8ef2dc4f-02a9-4af5-a2db-beaa234aa3a6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Inspired by the Windows Aero glass theme for Windows 7 and Vista operating systems, this wireless keyboard and mouse combo has a translucent trim that complements the sleek design. The mouse has a similar design. It is an attractive silver color with black accents. The receiver conveniently snaps onto the bottom of the mouse, so combined with the keyboard’s mere 37.4 ounces (about 2 pounds), travelling with this particular cordless keyboard and mouse is a cinch.","Speaking to in-depth consumer research, the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 6000 Keyboard and Mouse combo has a very ergonomic design. The keyboard has Microsoft’s signature comfort curve design with a soft palm rest to support your wrists, which helps prevent carpal tunnel. The wireless mouse has a rubber grip, four-way scrolling and laser technology that provides for a more precise response and requires less wrist movement. The keys aren’t spill resistant though, making for disastrous consequences if liquid is accidently spilled on it. The mouse also has five programmable buttons that can be customized for maximum functionality. However, this wireless mouse doesn’t have click-to-click functionality like its competitors, meaning it has a free scroll that makes it hard to precisely reach your desired location."]},"id":"13a43fa6-a068-429c-80ee-d7faffafe829","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Mouse Design"},"id":"782840da-88f8-44c3-a2e9-38caefbe3d5f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["A perk that outweighs the fact that you have to install software before using this wireless keyboard and mouse is that the installed software includes a help page with answers to any questions you may have about the set.

On the product page, Microsoft has included a product tour to familiarize you with the wireless keyboard and mouse as well as a link to product support. The product support page includes contact information or downloadable user manuals and quick start guides. A three-year warranty is included to protect you from any product defects during the first three years of ownership.","In order to install and operate this wireless keyboard and mouse, be sure that your computer’s operating system is Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7.
