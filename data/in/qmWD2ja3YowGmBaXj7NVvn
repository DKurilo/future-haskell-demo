This <a href=\"/best-p2p-payments\">person-to-person payments</a> service runs on the messenger app, so it only works with people who also have Facebook accounts.","To use this feature, you need to register a debit card from a U.S. bank to your Facebook account. To provide extra security, you can require the feature to request your password before authorizing transfers. Once this is done, you can open a chat and press the $ icon in the bottom bar. The payment features open a window to lead you through the process. You can choose to send or request money, set the amount, and make notes.","The money can take three to five business days to process, depending in part on how quickly your bank handles such transactions. Unlike some peer-to-peer payment apps, you cannot cancel a transaction once you&#39;ve made it. In fact, you can&#39;t even decline money someone sends you if you have a debit card attached to your account.","This feature is free for anyone qualified to use it. To qualify, you must live in the U.S., be 18 or over, have a U.S. debit card tied to the amount, and not have been denied the ability to send or receive money from Facebook. Facebook has terms for using this feature and can disqualify you if you violate them. For example, you cannot use this app for selling or buying items.","Many solopreneurs, like authors or craftspeople, use Facebook for promoting their products, and there are groups dedicated to online &#34;garage sales.&#34; It&#39;s important, therefore, to remember that Facebook does not allow you to use its P2P payments app for business transactions. Further, the payments done over this feature are not protected against fraud, so it&#39;s important that you only use it to send and receive money from people you know well and trust.","The information surrounding your transaction is shared only between you and your friend. Your account information is secured on Facebook&#39;s servers with multiple layers of protection.","However, as a large, public platform, Facebook users are always open to scammers, such as the potential romantic interest wanting money so she can visit you or the alleged famous nonprofit personally messaging concerned FB citizens to get donations. The help section lists some of the most common scams and gives clues to watch out for. The best rule of thumb is only use Facebook&#39;s person-to-person payments feature with people you personally know and trust.","Facebook&#39;s Messenger app makes it convenient to reach out to friends and family all over the country. With the P2P payments feature on the Facebook&#39;s Messenger app, it&#39;s equally convenient to send or receive money with these people. It&#39;s limited to people in the U.S. and requires you register a debit card from a U.S. bank. You should only use this feature with Facebook friends you know and trust, as Facebook does not have fraud protection protocols. Facebook also prohibits using it P2P payment app for sales."]},"id":"3286d625-f58b-46bc-ad03-de099e7a6ccb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67656","url":"/messenger-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-02-05T17:30:05Z","datePublished":"2016-02-05T17:30:05Z","name":"Messenger","synopsis":"Facebook Messenger has become a convenient way for people to chat with each other, and with its payments feature, it's now equally convenient to send those friends money or to request money from them.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Facebook Messenger has become a convenient way for people to chat with each other, and with its payments feature, it's now equally convenient to send those friends money or to request money from them.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-02-05T17:30:05Z","id":"qmWD2ja3YowGmBaXj7NVvn","meta":{"title":"Messenger P2P Payments Review - Pros and Cons","description":"Facebook Messenger has a convenient feature for letting you do person-to-person payment transactions among family or friends on Facebook.
