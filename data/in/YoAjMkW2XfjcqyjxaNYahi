You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Lifesmart LS-WAC5 is a small <a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">window air conditioner</a> with several cooling options. This  unit features 5,000 BTU of power, three speeds and a digital remote. You can also set a 24-hour timer, and it includes a one-year warranty.","The power and performance on this product is best suited for small spaces. This Lifesmart AC unit features 5,000 BTU of power and can cool a room up to 150 square feet. There are also several options that allow you to control the airflow of the product. Three fan settings – low, medium and high – are available and produce strong airflow but do not activate the compressor. When using one of the three cooling modes, the window AC unit uses its compressor to cool along with the fan set at your desired intensity.","You can also choose a temperature with a control knob on the unit, and it can be set within a range of 64 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The wide temperature range on this device is one of its many benefits and helps it stand out.","The Lifesmart LS-WAC5 has an energy efficiency ratio (EER) of 9.7, while the best products have EERs of 10 greater. Because of this, it is not Energy Star certified","In addition to the many cool and fan settings, a dry mode is also available. When using this dehumidifying mode, excess moisture is removed from the air, which is particularly beneficial in humid climates. Furthermore, the machine allows you to set a 24-hour timer to automatically turn the unit on and off at specified times.","To make the product even simpler to use, it comes with a remote control. With the remote, you can easily determine settings, set the timer and power the window AC on and off.","One large benefit to this product is its compact design. This window AC unit is much smaller than many similar products, weighing approximately 40 pounds. It is only 12 inches tall, 16 inches wide and 13.5 inches long.","This window air conditioner includes a one-year limited manufacturer warranty. Many similar products provide a warranty that is five or more years, and this unit would benefit from a warranty in line with this standard."]},"id":"36707774-d565-44c3-937f-620146f186a4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"94627af3-9af7-49e0-a6b6-46c58fb720e1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Lifesmart LS-WAC5 has many benefits, including a variety of features, a remote control and a timer.
