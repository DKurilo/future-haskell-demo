Instead, the patterns are offered on the website as à la carte add-ons to the program, which displays and prints them.","The program can fully manipulate a given pattern to suit the needs of the designer. When you load the pattern into the program, a host of options appears. From here you can input the adjustments and measurements as needed to create the pattern on the screen. How much or how little you can do depends on which program you choose. If you&#39;re more interested in embroidery software, you might be interested in <a href=\"/bernina-review\">BERNINA</a>.","Different levels of program can be procured from the website. The Basic Reader, which simply reads patterns and allows for very minor adjustments, is free to download and includes a couple sample patterns with which to familiarize yourself with the products. Only a limited number of customizing functions are available with this option. On the other end of the spectrum, the Marker Studio is designed for high-capacity use by professional textile manufacturers.","The program itself is a 2D CAD drafting program that is designed for flat pattern creation and manipulation. Because the patterns are external additions to the program, created by independent designers, the levels of customization that are available for each item vary greatly. The extent to which a design can be customized is detailed in the product description.","If your needs extend beyond what is provided by the Basic Reader, the program can be upgraded for a fee. For example, the next step above is the Deluxe Editor, which does everything the Basic Reader does with some added editing functions. Compared with other pattern-making software, the cost of the higher-tiered programs isn’t high, but the patterns have an associated cost as well. Depending on how many pattern sets you need, the costs can escalate quickly.","PatternMaker offers a free 30-day trial for any of its more sophisticated drafting programs – as well as a free pattern for pants and a bodice – to give users a sense of their capabilities. PatternMaker is available for Windows systems only."]},"id":"25b0634b-9967-4b22-b5dd-afe69a59d89e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61209","url":"/patternmaker-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-18T17:05:35Z","datePublished":"2014-11-18T17:05:35Z","name":"PatternMaker","synopsis":"PatternMaker software differentiates itself immediately by noting that, as opposed to most other pattern-making software, the patterns are not built into the program.
