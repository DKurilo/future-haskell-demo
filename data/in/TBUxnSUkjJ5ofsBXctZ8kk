These lightweight headphones are suitable for listening to music or watching movies in private without worrying about bothering those around you. Because they are so lightweight and comfortable, they are also perfect for listening to music on the go. Because of their light weight, comfort, impressive sound quality and excellent value, these stereo headphones are the best we reviewed."]},"id":"8d9bed3a-631d-4c50-ab6a-a19c1415f4ae","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"4af7088d-8982-41e6-abc3-2f2d46d1be3f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["These stereo headphones have the widest frequency range of any that we tested. The AH-D1001 can reproduce frequencies from 8Hz to 37kHz. The average healthy young person can only hear frequencies from 20Hz to 20kHz. As we age, we naturally lose our ability to hear higher frequencies. If you are over 20 years old you probably can’t hear frequencies above 16kHz. If you are over 40, chances are you can’t hear much past 12kHz.","So why is it significant that high-quality stereo headphones have a wide frequency response? Basically, it means that they can reproduce all the tones and sounds that were originally recorded. Even if you can’t hear those higher frequencies, their presence can make the music and sound effects sound more clear and crisp. While you also may not be able to hear the lowest frequencies, you will be able to experience and feel the deep, clear bass tones these stereo headphones can reproduce.","In the low frequency range the bass is deep and driving without overwhelming the music. The bass is clear and does not muddy the sound. You can clearly distinguish different bass instrument lines that all reside in a similar frequency range.","The mid-range frequencies are really nice and reproduce the subtle inflections the vocalists make as they sing their songs. The audio headphones do a really nice job of reproducing mid-range percussion and wind instruments, giving them clarity and punch. The mid-range frequencies are bit recessed compared to some other more expensive headphones, but for a set in this price range they perform surprisingly well.","The treble keeps the high frequencies crystal clear without being too bright or sounding tinny. The superior high frequency response keeps percussion instruments, such as cymbals and tambourines sounding clean, crisp and real.","These stereo headphones seem to have been designed specifically with portable music players in mind. They are very easy to drive, meaning you don’t need an amp to use them with an MP3 player. With a maximum power input of 1,300 mW, they can easily be used with just about any portable device.","While the stereo headphones do fit around the ear and have a closed back, they were not designed to cancel out ambient sound. Your coworker or spouse won&#39;t have a hard time getting your attention as you listen to your music. Even though the ambient sound gets in, they do a good job of keeping the music in the ear cups so you don’t bother those around you."]},"id":"7ba5d6ab-af43-4248-87c2-c2c7985c80fe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"b8a734ec-81bb-46ad-bd38-24ddcb04efc5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["These audio headphones weigh only 6.3 ounces. They are very light and very comfortable to wear. You can wear them for several hours at a time without making your ears sore or irritating the top of your head. You might even forget you are wearing them after a while. The ear cups include a good-size 40 mm speaker driver to give you a fairly big sound in a small package.","Because they are so light, the stereo headphones may feel like they are cheaply made and that they can be broken easily. With care they should last you a very long time. The lightness make this product very comfortable to wear. The ear cups stay in place without pressing your head like a vice. However, if you have large ears, you may find that the ear cups do not fit correctly around your ears and that could become uncomfortable if you wear them for extended periods.","One drawback is the black artificial leather (pleather) ear pads and head pads. The pleather gives the AH-D1001 a classy look, but the material doesn’t breathe or wick away moisture. It could be a little uncomfortable to wear these them during the hot summer months if your ears and the top of your head get too sweaty."]},"id":"e84ebd6c-1c11-4254-bafe-f03008f5fd2a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Accessories"},"id":"d22d7578-4a42-4584-a892-f6573c6cf6b9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The accessories out of the box include a handy soft fabric carrying case and a 5-foot cable with a 1/8-inch gold-plated plug.

At the same time, you don’t want a pair  that is so good that they reveal the flaws that can exist in compressed MP3 files.","The Denon AH-D1001 stereo headphones are a perfect match for use with portable devices. They are great over the ear headphones with impressive sound quality and clarity. The headphones are very lightweight and extremely comfortable.
