You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Philips Blu-ray Disc player BDP5506/F7 is a <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">3D Blu-ray player</a> with the ability to connect wirelessly with your PC or Mac via Philips&#39; MediaConnect technology. Add that to its fantastic 3D playback, full 1080x1920-pixel resolution, internet capabilities and more, and you get a product that occupies a place on our list of the top 10 best 3D Blu-ray players.","First things first, the 3D playback on this player is excellent. We rated these 3D Blu-ray players on the assumption that they would be used with a television or monitor with 3D capabilities that includes 3D glasses. Unfortunately, none of the 3D Blu-ray players we reviewed comes with 3D glasses of their own. That is somewhat of a letdown because in many cases, 3D TVs and monitors only come with a single pair of glasses. Watching movies in the third dimension is a social experience. Expect to fork out some extra cash if you want your friends to travel to Pandora with you.","Putting 3D aside for a moment, this Blu-ray player also has fantastic traditional 2D technology. The resolution of this device tops out at 1080 x 1920 pixels. Most commercial content is in this resolution or lower (usually lower.) Therefore, you would be hard pressed to find any film, TV show or video that this player is not capable of playing to its full capacity.","Furthermore, this unit has upscaling technology, which stretches standard-definition video and images to a 1080p resolution. This sort of scaling has the tendency to make standard-def images look somewhat skewed and distorted. To combat this problem, Philips included progressive scan and noise reduction features that help eliminate most of the pixilation and visual artifacts caused by scaling videos and images.","The connectivity array on this 3D Blu-ray passes muster. On the rear panel, you&#39;ll find audio terminals for analog devices. Additionally, you have composite, digital coaxial, HDMI and Ethernet terminals. You get one of each. On the front/side panel, you have a USB port to connect mobile devices. Analog component terminals are the only connectivity options missing from this unit."]},"id":"e74a7d73-b976-4f0b-af26-1edbe5d60d46","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f7758c48-5bce-4b8a-8b98-0ae2957606cd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Philips Blu-ray Disc player BDP5506/F7 has all the features and functionality we expect in a 3D Blu-ray player.
