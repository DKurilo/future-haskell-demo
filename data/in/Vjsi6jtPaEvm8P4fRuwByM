Despite the comfort and companionship offered through owning a cat or dog, these critters have the unfortunate habit of leaving hair and dander everywhere. The end result is a home full of allergens and a rather distinctive smell that can become quite unpleasant. But by using this canister vacuum, you can easily remove pet hair and dander and regain a fresh smell in your home. Your guests won&#39;t even know you have any pets."]},"id":"e66e991e-483b-4521-9ff5-feb0decdaf8f","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/ft7pqkua3sfgn3QhzEhuLi.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57672-eureka-pet-lover-3684f3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ft7pqkua3sfgn3QhzEhuLi.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"ft7pqkua3sfgn3QhzEhuLi","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ft7pqkua3sfgn3QhzEhuLi.jpg","alt":""},"id":"2e427ddf-68d8-4b07-b89c-e816d0cf9511","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Whereas the majority of top rated canister vacuum cleaners weigh 15 to 25 pounds, the Eureka Pet Lover  sets itself apart as a small canister vacuum and only weighs 9 pounds. It accomplishes this because many of its integral parts are actually made of plastic. While this does imply a level of brittleness, it allows for easier handling and carrying.","Despite this compact design, it still has the power needed to agitate carpet and adequately remove pet hair and dander. Its narrow wand and head design allow the device to quickly and easily navigate around furniture and get hard-to-reach spots that your pet may frequent, such as under the bed.","This top rated canister vacuum comes with a patented PetPaw attachment designed specifically for removing pet hair embedded into surfaces like carpet and upholstery. The issue with pet hair is it can easily tangle and become deep rooted into such surfaces, and simple agitation simply won&#39;t remove them. This attachment uses plastic teeth to loosen up trapped particles, and then utilizes a rubber strip to grab the particles from the surface. The bristles on the head brush then remove the accumulated debris.","For individuals seeking a device that will clean up after pets, the Eureka Pet Lover 3684F is one of the best options on the market. Many canister vacuum cleaner reviews will point to this device for its compact design and efficiency in removing hair, dander and allergens alike. Its overall performance is very surprising due to its small size, and with the combination of its HEPA filter with specialized attachments, it&#39;ll make living with pets even less of a burden on individuals with allergies."]},"id":"1b9b0deb-5148-489a-8aef-948fbe5889b4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57700","url":"/eureka-pet-lover-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-04T13:32:07Z","datePublished":"2013-10-04T13:32:07Z","name":"Eureka Pet Lover 3684F","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
