The 1 HP, 6-amp motor gives you powerful performance and features variable six-speed options for uninterrupted work with various weight laminates. The motor is double insulated and housed in aluminum. The base of the router is made of strong metal, and this is where the rack and pinion system helps to adjust the motor’s height. A quick-release flip lever locks it in place and makes adjustments easier.","This laminate trimmer is compact and has a diameter of 2-1/2”. The 1-HP motor can be adjusted from 10,000 – 30,000 RPM. The speed-control flip button sits at the top of the motor housing, which is the location many craftsmen prefer because of its easy access.","A 1” long ruler with 1/16” and 1 mm increments located on the front of the housing of the unit, which can be clearly seen as you adjust the depth of the bit. Swapping bits out is also easier, thanks to a spindle-lock button. Added stability comes in the form of rubber padding that is partly wrapped around the base. This helps grip the area you’re working with, reducing the chances of marring the work surface.","This unit is sturdy and weighs 6 pounds. It is silver and black, with a removable dust extractor port on the side. There is also an edge guide and flush trimming attachment. The Rocky 30 trim router includes a spare set of motor brushes, a ¼” router bit collet, a wrench, a flush trimming attachment and a dust extractor port that you can snap in the router.","The MLCS website offers additional accessories to complement this router, and the PDF version of the instruction manual can be viewed or downloaded online. The Rocky 30 trim router is covered with a limited 3-year manufacturer&#39;s warranty."]},"id":"a26749f8-baa9-445f-b39d-57682b48c213","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61659","url":"/rocky-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-17T19:32:19Z","datePublished":"2014-12-17T19:32:19Z","name":"Rocky 30 Trim Router","synopsis":"The durable Rocky 30 Trim Router by MLCS is easy to use and is one of the few palm routers you can purchase with rack-and-pinion height adjustment that adds to the Rocky 30's solid performance and stability.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The durable Rocky 30 Trim Router by MLCS is easy to use and is one of the few palm routers you can purchase with rack-and-pinion height adjustment that adds to the Rocky 30's solid performance and stability.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-12-17T19:32:19Z","id":"qS84vxiJ3DdUPJAEBxWMn9","meta":{"title":"Rocky 30 Trim Router Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Rocky 30 Trim Router.
