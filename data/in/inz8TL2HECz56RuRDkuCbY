It has excellent features, and both a side and sear burner. This gas grill&#39;s large cooking space allows you to cook burgers, brats and hot dogs all at once. The construction quality of this gas grill could be better, but it is still a solid addition to any backyard.","The Brinkmann has five 12,000 BTU primary burners, totaling 60,000 BTUs generated in the main cooking space. This is a powerful grill, and it spreads heat evenly across the burners. It also features a 12,000 BTU side burner and a 12,000 BTU sear burner. The sear burner is a nice touch for this gas grill. Searing burners are useful for prepping your meat with a quick burst of heat before letting it cook on a primary burner. The 12,000 BTU sear burner on the Brinkmann grill provides plenty of power to get that extra burst of flavor from your barbecued foods.","Whether you&#39;re looking to feed a few guests or supply burgers for the entire neighborhood, the Brinkmann 5-burner gas grill offers plenty of cooking space to get all of your barbecue favorites ready to go. This gas grill has 639 square inches of primary cooking space and 257 square inches of warming rack space, which is one of the most generous cooking areas, in terms of space, that we saw. Furthermore, a built-in temperature gauge helps you make sure the grilling is done right. Unfortunately, the Brinkmann does not have a natural gas option.","The construction of this gas grill, while it’s not bad, is not of the highest quality. The housing material is stainless steel, but appears to be thin and flimsy. It is sturdy, but many other products on our gas grill reviews are made from stronger materials and appear more durable than the Brinkmann. The cooking grates are porcelain-coated cast iron, which allows for easy cleanup after the party is over.","The five primary burners are made of stainless steel, which helps prevent rust and wear. At 160 pounds, which could make it a little difficult to move around once it&#39;s constructed. It stands 66 inches tall and is 49 inches wide. This is a large gas grill, but it makes use of its size by offering plenty of grilling and warming shelf space.","The Brinkmann is covered by a lifetime warranty for the burners and a three-year warranty on all other stainless steel parts, which competes with the best warranties out there. The valves, frame, cart, igniter, cooking grates and other related parts are covered by a one-year warranty, which is fairly standard. The Brinkmann website is full of useful information and tips on how to make the most of your gas grill. You can also reach Brinkmann via phone and email if you need additional support."]},"id":"ef778bb7-6387-4962-abe5-9b830e9fb569","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"02e2f535-7108-43cf-9e60-891e40ea72b4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are looking for a gas BBQ grill with plenty of space and power, the Brinkmann 5-burner gas grill is a good choice.
