With Goowy you can customize your webtop to reflect your personality. In addition to email, Goowy offers 1 GB of online storage, games and all kinds if widgets.","Goowy includes 2GB of inbox storage, 1 GB of online storage, spam filtering, image blocking, drag and drop, and the ability to import your address book from other email accounts.","Goowy includes several unique features with your account registration including, IM, Widgets and RSS feeds. Goowy’s IM can import your buddy lists from MSN messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, AIM and ICQ. Goowy’s customization features allow you to import images for desktops and include several of Goowy’s minis (widgets) like a clock, comics, to–do lists, weather reports, eBay, iTunes, quotes, YouTube and more. Additionally, you can import any RSS feed onto your webtop.","Goowy’s email services are pretty run of the mill. Their spam filter catches most known spammers; however, a few of our legitimate emails were put in the junk folder. Although Goowy doesn’t provide POP3 service, you can configure your Goowy account to access external mail that does provide POP3 like Gmail.","Unfortunately, you cannot adjust the spam filter strength. Goowy mail does not include custom filters to help you sort incoming mail and they do not provide HTTPS secure login. Goowy’s help section was disappointing. They only included a small FAQ section and member forums for all questions and problems related to the program. There is no way to contact the company regarding issues and the forums are cluttered with useless threads.","We found Goowy to be a fun and unique, <a href=\"/best-free-email-services\">free email</a> provider. We think they have a promising future, sadly in this review; they were up against some stiff competition."]},"id":"a074b90d-a070-4045-b197-f7c0f4651941","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_2047","url":"/goowy-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2018-05-24T19:02:56Z","name":"Goowy","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.
