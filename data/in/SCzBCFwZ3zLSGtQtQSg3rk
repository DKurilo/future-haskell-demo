Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This Kenmore Elite <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-mixers/\">stand mixer</a> comes with a 6-quart bowl, which is the biggest bowl capacity of all the mixers we tested. It’s also the heaviest mixer on our lineup, which could mitigate wobbling when you have a big load in the bowl. The Elite includes more features than any of the other mixers we reviewed, and it is one of the most versatile options because of all the attachments you can use with it.","Although this isn’t the best stand mixer on our list, it did well when we challenged the machine and its dough hook to a two-loaf bread dough recipe for 10 minutes. However, it was tripped up a bit when we tossed some butter and sugar in the bowl to cream. The paddle picked up most of the ingredients and mostly combine them, but there was a lot of butter pushed onto the sides of the bowl, where it stayed uncombined with our cookie dough. The egg white test was even less impressive – the Kenmore barely whipped the egg whites to a frothy consistency.","If you need to make several batches of icing at once, this machine can likely handle it, but if you have a recipe that requires more than 8 cups of flour at once, the motor might not be able to manage. Without overload protection, you risk burning out the motor.","This electric mixer includes the most convenience features we’ve seen on any home mixer. It has variable speeds that you can slowly increase to minimize ingredients flying out of the bowl, and you can use the splashguard as another way to keep the contents where they belong.","A timer counts down or up, depending on what you need. The stainless steel bowl includes a handle, and it is dishwasher safe. This machine uses a bowl lift mechanism, which is similar to professional models. It’s neither better nor worse than the locking tilt head, but at one point during testing, the bowl did jump off the base even though it was locked. Additionally, the Kenmore Elite stand mixer includes a small blue light that illuminates the bowl opening, so you can see what you’re doing as you add mix-ins.","As with most stand mixers, this one comes with a paddle, whisk and dough hook in the box. This is also a very versatile machine because you can use KitchenAid attachments with it.","Of all the mixers on our lineup, the Kenmore Elite offers the best warranty at five years; if you find that your mixer has a defective part, the manufacturer works with you to make it right. You can contact customer support by phone or email, and details are available on the mixer maker’s website."]},"id":"fcc6d0dc-e629-4725-b190-a02a9adf525f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f31e0700-c8d0-4b7f-a00f-eb914dc2275e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The modern design and features included on the Kenmore Elite stand mixer are lovely and helpful, but this mixer just doesn’t perform as well as the higher-ranked products we reviewed.
