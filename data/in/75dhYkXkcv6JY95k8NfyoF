It has a traffic receiver built into the device, navigation assistance functions, and a simple array of media playback features to keep you and your passengers entertained during your drive.","This double-din <a href=\"/best-in-dash-navigation-systems\">navigation system</a> comes preloaded with maps of the United States, Canada and Mexico. Premium Aptix Source Units gives you turn-ty-turn GPS navigation for the United States. It has 12 million points of interest – the most of any device in our comparison – and you can program in your own destinations, like your home or workplace. With a few built-in voice commands, you can control the system hands-free. While you’re driving, the VRN-65HB will help guide you into the correct lane and show you the current speed limit so that you can obey driving laws wherever you are, even if you’re in an unfamiliar city.","Like most of the touchscreen navigation units in this comparison, the VRN-65HB can play CDs and DVDs. It can also play saved media files via an external storage source, or through a Bluetooth connection to your Android phone. You can view navigation details, browse the interface menu or watch videos via the 6.2-inch capacitive display, which has a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels. Rear-seat passengers can adjust basic settings and play a movie using the included remote control, so they don’t have to bother you while you drive. The GPS system can also integrate with your existing steering wheel controls so you can keep using them.","The in-dash system ships with a one-year warranty from the manufacturer. There are a couple of informational resources for the GPS system, available online, such as the owner’s manual, and the company does have a social media presence if you want to contact them that way. Otherwise, you can reach the customer support team via email anytime if you have a question or problem.","The Soundstream VRN-65HB is a decent option for anyone looking for strong navigation features and decent media playback options. However, it doesn’t allow for interface customization, it has limited media streaming capacities and it cannot connect to an iPhone. Given that the VRN-65HB is one of the least expensive models in our comparison, it’s a great deal, especially for anyone who doesn’t need or want a bunch of premium features or extended functionality."]},"id":"52b2a684-f211-4eed-a223-8959f627bcce","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69232","url":"/soundstream-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-04-17T14:37:52Z","datePublished":"2017-04-17T14:37:52Z","name":"Soundstream VRN-65HB","synopsis":"The Soundstream VRN-65HB is an aftermarket in-dash navigation system with Bluetooth connectivity and a capacitive touchscreen, much like the Joying JY-UL135N2 and Kenwood DDX24BT.","review":{"rating":32,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Soundstream VRN-65HB is an aftermarket in-dash navigation system with Bluetooth connectivity and a capacitive touchscreen, much like the Joying JY-UL135N2 and Kenwood DDX24BT.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-04-17T14:37:52Z","id":"75dhYkXkcv6JY95k8NfyoF","meta":{"title":"Soundstream VRN-65HB Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Soundstream VRN-65HB has plenty of navigation functionality.
