It can remove pollutants in rooms that reach up to 318 square feet and makes just over three air changes an hour, which means all the air in the room is pushed through the filters once every 19 minutes or so. Although this isn&#39;t the most impressive air change rate we have seen, it is still good enough to prevent allergens from settling in your home.","The purifier has an optional ionizer, so you can use this cleaning technology if you don&#39;t mind the potential risks of the trace amounts of ozone. Unfortunately, this Kenmore air purifier lacks an auto mode, which is a setting found on other air cleaners that detects the level of pollutants in the room and automatically adjusts the settings to maximize the effectiveness of the machine. It does not include a sleep mode either, which lowers settings so the machine doesn&#39;t make too much noise while you sleep. However, it does have an operational timer that allows you to program specific times for it to turn on or off. This is a convenient feature that enables you to have the machine turn on in the morning and operate while you&#39;re out of the house.","The Kenmore 83396 is one of the lighter air purifiers we reviewed, weighing in at only 17 pounds. This is just below the average weight of the machines we reviewed, so it&#39;s easier to move around the house than many of the others on our lineup. It also has a low profile, so you can store it just about anywhere in the house. However, the machine is slightly louder than average, reaching up to 62 dB. To give you an idea of how loud this is, a whisper usually ranges around 30 dB, while a ringtone can reach 80 dB.","This machine is Energy Star verified, which indicates it uses less energy than many other purifiers on the market. Based on manufacturer specifications, we estimate the electrical cost of the machine to be just under $40 a year. The Kenmore 83396 is also AHAM verified, which means it was put through AHAM&#39;s rigorous and methodical testing process to reach its CADR scores. Without this verification, it is difficult to ascertain how a purifier reached its CADR specifications.","Kenmore only warrants this machine for one year, which is the shortest warranty we have found for air purifiers. You also won&#39;t find a user manual for this product on the company&#39;s website, so make sure you hang on to the physical copy that comes with it. However, you can contact the company through email or live chat."]},"id":"1d1dda3f-3b5a-48bb-84cd-8e81e8b4c7fa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9eaf628a-852f-4188-b7a5-49dceeb5dca5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore 83396 is a decent air purifier that has somewhat low CADR ratings, meaning it isn&#39;t as effective at removing indoor pollutants as the best air purifiers we reviewed.

However, you will find an operational timer that allows you to set specific times for the machine to run. Overall, this Kenmore air purifier can clean the air in small rooms but lacks the some of the important options we look for."]},"id":"ac3d0d2f-95cc-47ed-8811-fa6c27c62607","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67853","url":"/kenmore-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-05-05T18:59:12Z","datePublished":"2016-05-05T18:59:12Z","name":"Kenmore 83396","synopsis":"The Kenmore 83396 has some of the lowest CADR scores out of all the air purifiers we reviewed, meaning it isn't as effective at removing indoor pollutants from your home.","review":{"rating":85,"verdict":"This Kenmore air purifier is good enough at cleaning small rooms, but it lacks the convenient features and support options we look for.","pros":["This machine is one of the lighter air purifiers we reviewed, making it easier to move around the house as you need."],"cons":["The Kenmore 83396 lacks an auto mode, a convenient feature found on the best air cleaners."]},"strapline":"The Kenmore 83396 has some of the lowest CADR scores out of all the air purifiers we reviewed, meaning it isn't as effective at removing indoor pollutants from your home.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-09-26T00:00:00Z","id":"BbsftdfEwJg7AyKs6fjCvC","meta":{"title":"Kenmore 83396 HEPA-Filter Air Purifier Review - Pros, Cons & Verdict","description":"This Kenmore air purifier is good enough at cleaning small rooms, but it lacks the convenient features and support options we look for."},"products":[{"slug":"kenmore-83396","url":"/product/kenmore-83396","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:16:06Z","name":"Kenmore 83396","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:16:06Z","id":"QhSyY8QM4Tw6QTAGGyQW9e","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-05T14:16:06Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/dQGummRfHcLnNg56JmwHvE.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:16:06Z","mimeType":"","name":"f66a6e0171938ea74c5944b44b39fe8f.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/f66a6e0171938ea74c5944b44b39fe8f.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:16:06Z","id":"dQGummRfHcLnNg56JmwHvE","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dQGummRfHcLnNg56JmwHvE.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Kenmore 83396 HEPA-Filter Air Purifier Review - Pros, Cons &amp; Verdict","description":"This Kenmore air purifier is good enough at cleaning small rooms, but it lacks the convenient features and support options we look for."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/dQGummRfHcLnNg56JmwHvE.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:16:06Z","mimeType":"","name":"f66a6e0171938ea74c5944b44b39fe8f.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/f66a6e0171938ea74c5944b44b39fe8f.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:16:06Z","id":"dQGummRfHcLnNg56JmwHvE","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dQGummRfHcLnNg56JmwHvE.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Kenmore 83396 HEPA-Filter Air Purifier Review - Pros, Cons &amp; Verdict","description":"This Kenmore air purifier is good enough at cleaning small rooms, but it lacks the convenient features and support options we look for."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/health/wellness/best-air-purifiers/kenmore-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"health-and-beauty","url":"/health-and-beauty","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:16:06Z","name":"Health & Beauty","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:16:06Z","id":"5johNE4w3ctxAug7oACGPh","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"air-quality","url":"/health-and-beauty/air-quality","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:16:06Z","name":"Air Quality","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:16:06Z","id":"9XQeSF4Awfph4vGpgLPmkB","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
