On the app, there is an on-screen gamepad which you press to steer the plane. When using the headset, however, you just tilt your head in the direction that you want the plane to fly. It&#39;s tricky at first, but is still a lot of fun. And if you don&#39;t get the hang of it, there&#39;s an auto-pilot mode. If you don&#39;t want to fly the plane in first person, it has a wing-view or rear-view mode you switch to where you can even take selfies.","You&#39;re able to save your flight recordings on the onboard SD card and transfer them to your smartphone over Wi-Fi. Or if you wish, the video and images can be sent to YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram easily, too.","You can use your own paper if you run out of the included template sheets. The plane has a carbon-fiber and nylon reinforced frame and handles crashes just fine. Not only that, it has sensors that turn off the engine when you are about to land. Other sensors include a gyroscope, accelerometer and barometer.
