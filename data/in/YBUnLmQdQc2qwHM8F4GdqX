Activite Pop <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html\">fitness tracker</a> is an unassuming analog watch with all of its features hidden below the surface. Although it looks like a regular ticking watch, this formidable device does everything you&#39;d expect from a touchscreen fitness tracker. You can keep track of your fitness metrics, set vibrating alarms, set goals and integrate with tons of apps.","It might not look like a fitness tracker, but it tracks all the same metrics as one. You can see metrics like your daily steps taken, distance traveled and calories burned from the Withings app. This exercise tracker is fairly accurate but did struggle with calculating calories burned and active minutes during our exercise testing.","Via the Withings app, you can set custom goals for weight loss, sleep and daily steps. This watch even vibrates when you set an alarm to remind to you get up and move or wake you up silently in the morning.","Like most activity tracker watches, the Activite Pop automatically syncs with your phone via Bluetooth and is compatible with more than 45 third-party apps. However, this watch only stores one day of data, so if you don&#39;t sync every day, you&#39;ll lose your fitness tracking results.","This watch fitness tracker isn&#39;t designed like the typical fitness tracker. Instead it looks like a normal analog watch with ticking hands and a watch face. However, if you tap on the screen, the hands spring to whatever time you&#39;ve set an alarm for. The secondary watch face also features a progress meter. This tracker is waterproof up to 50 meters underwater and comes in four different colors. It has a coin cell battery, so you don&#39;t have to recharge it like you do with a LED-screened device. You can go for about eight months before you have to replace the battery.","The Activite Pop is covered by a 12-month warranty, which is about average for fitness trackers. You can find an email address on the Withings website for customer support. Withings doesnâ€™t publish phone numbers on the website and also lacks a live chat feature."]},"id":"3d3df880-7dab-4809-b88e-f0abffe92c57","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a71f6ae2-47ca-42ef-936a-f24d5069d91c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Withings Activite Pop activity tracker is a simple yet powerful device that helps you better manage your fitness levels.
