It has a robust, 1,900-watt motor and a long, 10-foot cord, but it’s the only <a href=\"/best-hair-dryers\">hair dryer</a> we tested that doesn’t feature an advanced heating technology like ceramic, tourmaline or ionic. It worked well on several hair types nonetheless, and our testers thought it seemed durable.","Although Parlux markets the unit as lightweight, the 3200 Compact is the heaviest hair dryer we tested. It weighs in at 1.9 pounds, and it doesn’t feel evenly balanced.","“I feel like holding it very long would make my hand tired,” said one tester. “It feels heavy and awkward, especially at the back.”","The most compact, most lightweight blower we tested, the <a href=\"/revlon-perfect-heat-review\">Revlon Perfect Heat Fast Dry Travel Styler</a>, is also the most affordable model. While the 3200 Compact has an MSRP of $155, you can pick up the Revlon dryer for less than $20.","“Most of these hair dryers are too expensive for me to consider buying them,” one tester lamented of our top 10, “especially this one [the Parlux 3200] and the <a href=\"/chi-review\">CHI PRO</a>.”","Both hair dryers would have scored higher in our rankings if they had more competitive price tags. Even so, they cost hundreds less than popular blowers such as the $400 <a href=\"https://www.dyson.com/hair-care/dyson-supersonic-overview.html\">Dyson Supersonic</a>.","The Parlux 3200 Compact has two air speed settings and two temperature settings. Its instructional markings are a bit hard to read, and its cool-shot button is unmarked. It operates at a volume of 82.5 to 84.8 decibels, and its air speed ranges from 22.9 to 30.9 feet per second. Its temperature ranges from 114 to 161 degrees.","This hair dryer comes with two concentrators. One is narrow to help straighten hair; the other is larger and beveled for smoother blow drying. The accessories are easy to attach and remove, but they don’t feel secure during use. Like most of the hair dryers we tested, the Parlux has a removable endcap to help you keep its filter clean. Cleaning maintains optimal airflow and thus prolongs the life of the motor.","The best blower warranties we found provide four years of consumer protection, but Parlux covers the 3200 Compact for just one year. You can contact customer service by phone or email."]},"id":"80de2c58-b8d8-4162-a0be-3f8688ee088f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70103","url":"/parlux-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-07-09T21:53:23Z","datePublished":"2018-07-09T21:53:23Z","name":"Parlux 3200 Compact","synopsis":"The Parlux 3200 Compact is made in Italy.","review":{"rating":62,"verdict":"The Parlux 3200 Compact is a heavy hair dryer with a steep price.
