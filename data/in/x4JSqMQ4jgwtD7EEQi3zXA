The easiest upgrade you can do is to swap out your cheap factory speakers for a pair of aftermarket, three-way <a href=\"/best-car-speakers\">car speakers</a>. Next, you can upgrade your car stereo. You can add an amplifier and a subwoofer. You can add tweeters and additional speakers in strategic locations. You can literally turn your car into a rolling boom box. However, unless you install vibration dampeners, you&#39;re only experiencing a fraction of the audio quality that these upgrades offer.","The problem with automobiles is they are cacophonous metal shells that trap and reverberate sound waves. These sound waves occur when something moves the surrounding atmospheric air. Usually, you don&#39;t feel it but it&#39;s much like dropping a stone into a pool   when a speaker vibrates, the waves ripple outward in the air. The quicker it moves the air, the closer the waves are to each other and the higher pitch you hear. Likewise, the slower it moves the air, the further the waves are to each other and you hear a lower pitch. Unfortunately, the sound waves crash and bounce off objects just like the waves caused by dropping a stone into a pool.","Listening to music in your bedroom or living room is not the same as listening to your favorite tunes on your way to work. Your car stereo system contends with a roaring engine, constantly changing road conditions, city noise and acoustically reflective materials   you are sitting in a metal or fiberglass box after all! Sure, cushions and carpet lines the interior, but there are also many acoustically reflective materials like hard rubbers and plastics and all that glass. So what do you do? You turn up the stereo to drown out the cacophony, sacrificing audio quality and your future ability to hear.","Vibration dampeners can help minimize the amount of sound waves your audio has to contend with by absorbing vibrations and minimizes acoustical reverberations. You don&#39;t have to turn your stereo to 11 and damage your hearing to enjoy the wicked riffs of your favorite band. Dynamat is one of the best examples of a vibration dampener. It comes in adhesive sheets made of lightweight elastomeric butyl and aluminum constrained-layers. We recommend installing vibration dampeners in the following areas for a much improved car audio experience:","<strong>Hood</strong><br/>Your engine is the worst offender to your acoustics. It&#39;s loud. It vibrates the entire car. By installing Dynamat on the underside of the hood so that it faces the engine, you can dramatically reduce the sound and vibrations caused by your engine.","<strong>Doors</strong><br/>Your doors are where you&#39;ll likely have between two or four speakers. Placing Dynamat in the door panel, behind the speakers, will greatly reduce vibrations in the door caused by the speakers. It will also reduce the sound of a slammed door to a mere muffle.","<strong>Ceiling</strong><br/>Your rear deck speaker reflects sound waves off the rear window and off the roof. Adding a sound dampener to the roof can reduce that reverberation. It dampens sound waves bouncing between the floor and the ceiling. It can also deaden the sound of rain and other external sounds.","<strong>Trunk</strong><br/>Lining your trunk with vibration dampeners is important if you install a subwoofer. Subwoofers produce heavy vibrations, so anything that can either move or resonate with the vibrations will move, adding unnecessary sound waves into the mix. Without dampeners in the trunk, your subwoofer can overwhelm all other frequencies. Vibration dampeners here are a no brainer. It&#39;s also the easiest place to install.  <br/><br/>"]},"id":"798f414d-f143-41da-ab2d-d8896ad157c3","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The biggest downside to installing vibration dampeners like Dynamat is that it often requires removing the interior. On the surface, the installation seems like an easy ordeal. All you have to do is cut the sheet to the specific shape needed, peel the adhesive backing and press it against the metal or fiberglass body. It&#39;s that simple   until you have to figure out how to remove door panels, carpet and anything else in your way. So unless you&#39;re somebody who can take stuff apart and put it back together again, you may want to leave the installation to professionals.","On the plus side, once the interior is back together, the vibration dampeners are out of sight. No eye sores. No ear sores. Just high quality audio as you roll into the sunset."]},"id":"30864433-e401-4607-ae3a-3b384aa225a8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8504","url":"/vibration-dampeners-how-to-enhance-your-car-audio","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-06-09T15:55:31Z","datePublished":"2014-06-09T15:55:31Z","name":"Vibration Dampeners: How to Enhance Your Car Audio","synopsis":"There are many ways to enhance the audio experience inside your car.
