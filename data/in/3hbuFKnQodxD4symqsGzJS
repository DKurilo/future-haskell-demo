However, Balboa Baby offers a few <a href=\"/best-baby-wraps\">baby wraps</a> that make wearing your baby enjoyable as well as fashionable.","Select products offer different colors and patterns suited for personal expression, though there are several solid neutral colors that would suit dads as well. One product by this company, the Balboa Baby Adjustable Sling, also features a ruffle at the top that, while aesthetically pleasing, also helps prevent your baby from spilling out. A handy pocket on the front of the sling lets you stow small objects as needed. If you don&#39;t want to deal with rings or buckles, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/best-baby-wraps\">Baby K&#39;Tan BREEZE</a>.","Developed, tested and recommended by Dr. William Sears, these slings bear the stamp of approval from the bestselling author, pediatrician and father of eight. Sears has written more than 40 books on child care and has numerous other credentials.","There are product demonstrations and step-by-step instructions for wearing the slings on the company website. These baby carriers come in one adjustable size for parents of all sizes; you choose what size to make it by adjusting the tail length. A longer tail means a smaller sling, and vice versa. The sling also accommodates babies of all sizes and in a variety of positions, including forward facing, cuddle style, cradle style and hip carrying for older babies.","Additionally, the site provides information on how to wear the sling correctly to ensure your baby is safe. Safety instructions include visual illustrations on correct and incorrect baby positioning. Each carrying style has step-by-step written instructions for positioning your baby, in addition to photo examples and how-to videos.","As an added convenience, this baby sling carrier is machine washable. Any parent knows that this is a handy and often-used feature whenever infants and toddlers are involved. You can find more detailed care instructions on the company website to ensure no damage is done to the slings in the wash.","Balboa Baby exchanges all products within 30 days of purchase if you&#39;re unsatisfied. However, you must pay shipping both ways as the customer."]},"id":"79ee1446-a554-4610-880c-67ab6fdc7534","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58770","url":"/balboa-baby-adjustable-sling-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-03T23:51:15Z","datePublished":"2014-02-03T23:51:15Z","name":"Balboa Baby Adjustable Sling","synopsis":"Most baby wraps are a single, stretchy piece of fabric that wraps around your body, and they are not typically known for being particularly attractive, focusing more on function than form.
