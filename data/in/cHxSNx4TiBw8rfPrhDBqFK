This native Australian company began in 1988 as a manufacturer of modems and has continued to innovate its way into several markets around the world, including home security solutions. The kit that we reviewed did not compare well with its similarly featured competitors, earning only modest scores in usability and customer service while offering little in the way of features. The system is worth a look, but it ultimately falls behind our higher-rated video security systems."]},"id":"d3c915f6-1bc8-4aab-9b70-0f3d28916a20","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Pricing &amp; Services"},"id":"18004c70-d91c-4192-b99a-dc4c58c01040","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Only two cameras are included with the Swann home security system, significantly limiting the flexibility of this surveillance kit. The two cameras also have a lower resolution than most of our top-rated products, coming in at 640 x 224. This resolution indicates that the picture produced by these home security cameras falls somewhere between the quality of a VHS tape and an early DVD. The picture is still in color and the cameras contain infrared LEDs that activate at night for 24/7 surveillance, but limiting the system to two cameras greatly hurts this product in our comparison.

However, they still claim that you can record continuously for up to two months with this hard drive by using only one camera at its lowest settings.

Unfortunately, this monitor is one of the few ways to view the feeds from the cameras themselves; you cannot transfer the feeds over a network with this system."]},"id":"6b753f3f-d53a-4ee5-a0a0-7878fb2e0c02","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Security Devices Included"},"id":"1d576652-937a-4054-b9ca-bfe4eb13ec0f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As it lacks the ability to view footage from any location with an internet connection as many other home security systems do, Swann’s video surveillance system can be inconvenient to use on a regular basis.
