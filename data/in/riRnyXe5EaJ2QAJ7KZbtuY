You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","Lockitron Bolt replaces the company’s original smart lock, and it has several important updates. This <a href=\"/best-smart-locks\">smart home lock</a> is good for both renters and homeowners. It notifies you when someone rings your doorbell or knocks at the door. The Bridge unit uses Bluetooth to connect to the web and allows you to grant others access to your home.","The new version does not have Wi-Fi built in but has a Bridge unit that replaces the built-in Wi-Fi. In addition, this Bluetooth door lock replaces your bolt lock. This unit comes at a moderate price, but you do have to pay for many of its add-ons. This may be an important factor to consider.","Rather than sliding over the existing door lock, which caused mechanical issues in the initial units, this smart home door lock replaces your dead bolt. It comes with a latch, lock cylinder and strike plate as well as a mounting plate. The body of this smart lock comes in brushed nickel, and other body styling will be available in the future. The box also includes a Philips screwdriver. If you opt for match keys, this lets you keep your keys by offering a match for different locks. After selecting a matching key set, you need to go to a hardware store to have them keyed, which will cost extra. This smart lock does not transmit photos.","This Bluetooth door lock does not have built-in Wi-Fi. While it was available on the original, there were issues with battery life caused by the Wi-Fi. Instead, this smart door lock comes with a Bridge that allows you to connect to the company’s website. By connecting to the web, you will have control no matter where you are. Since Bolt without the Bridge component still works at your door, Bridge acquisition is optional and adds expense.","The remote access you may want is absent on the base package. With the addition of Bridge, you can let someone enter your home with a virtual key. This is particularly useful for out-of-town guests or if you have construction at your home. Whenever your locked door is opened, you receive an email if you have Bridge. The need for an additional peripheral to enable remote access may be a consideration for some.","This updated smart lock gives you consistent power with Bluetooth for local use and web accessibility with Bridge without problems due to loss of internet, enabling remote access. The Lockitron Bolt with optional Bridge may be worth checking out."]},"id":"20b501d5-f45d-4339-9466-2a4556212ebf","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60660","url":"/lockitron-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-01T19:56:22Z","datePublished":"2014-10-01T19:56:22Z","name":"Lockitron","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
