You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Most cooks who buy <a href=\"/best-cookbook-and-recipe-software\">Mac recipe software</a> are looking for an all-in-one program that will store their recipes, provide them new recipes and plan menus and shopping lists. Some cooks, however, just need an inexpensive and simple database in which to store their information. Kitchen is the software for the latter group of people.","Unlike most of the Mac recipe software we reviewed, Kitchen does not come with pre-loaded recipes in its database. This is unfortunate for cooks who are looking to expand their recipe base with the purchase of a recipe organizing and planning program. But for anyone who wants to create a user-specific recipe database, this saves the extra step of deleting pre-loaded recipes.","Kitchen features relatively advanced search options for recipes, allowing users to search numerous fields at once; quite a relief after seeing the primitive search options offered by Shop’n’Cook Menu.","And adding recipes to the shopping list couldn’t be more straightforward for users with just a few recipes documented; just checkmark the recipes to shop for while on the shopping screen, add any additional items in the box on the right, then print and shop! When the shopping list is printed, it has checkboxes beside the item names to make shopping easier. For users with several dozen or several hundred recipes in their database, however, this is an inefficient way to add recipes, especially when compared to the simple drag and drop functionality found in many other programs we reviewed.","Kitchen even offers users the option to save a backup of the recipe database every time he or she closes the program. This way, the user does not have to remember to manually back up recipes and risk losing data. Users who do not want this information taking up space on their hard drive can chose to opt-out of this feature.","As an additional creative option, Kitchen offers users several font colors, styles and sizes. Much like iCuistot’s customizable themes, this is a feature with little practical value…though it is nice to be able to customize one’s recipes to print and share later.","Unfortunately, Kitchen’s help menu leaves something to be desired. It is simply a text file with the most basic of instructions. The website offers little to no help on the program specifically (we could not even find a direct link to Kitchen’s page from epigroove’s home page), but the site does offer a link to email the program developer, who can answer specific questions. On the bright side, it is unlikely that a help menu or support site would be needed for most users who have a basic knowledge of Mac computers and how their programs tend to work."]},"id":"0b0117e2-aba0-4d94-a0af-d4412648ce63","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a7a66f55-1d8e-41c3-8674-eb1d2e30df1e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though <strong>Kitchen</strong> is among the most bare-bones piece of software we reviewed, we have found that it offers enough features to make the price tag worthwhile for novice and more experienced cooks alike.
