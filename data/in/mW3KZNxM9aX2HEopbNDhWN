With government regulations halting the production of traditional incandescent light bulbs in recent years, new options have surfaced. The first option created was the compact fluorescent lamp, or CFL. These curly fluorescent bulbs are more energy efficient and last longer than an incandescent, but the bulb contains mercury and takes a while to shine at its brightest.","LED light bulbs are even more efficient to run than CFL bulbs and are just as affordable. In addition, LED lights contain no harmful materials and provide the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent, using up to 85 percent less power. This helps you save on your electricity bill without compromising on the amount of light. On this site, you will find reviews of the best LED light bulbs, including the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/light-bulb-guide,review-1986.html\">Cree 9.5-Watt LED Light Bulb</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/light-bulb-guide,review-1986.html\">Philips LED 425264</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/light-bulb-guide,review-1986.html\">Feit 13.5-watt</a>.","<strong>LED Light Bulbs: What to Look For</strong>","When you&#39;re shopping for an LED light bulb, it&#39;s important to find one that provides the amount of light you need, as well as the color of light you like. You&#39;ll also want to consider how the light emits from the bulb, and the dimensions of the bulb and base.","<strong>Energy Specifications</strong><br/>A standard 60-watt incandescent bulb puts off about 800 lumens. The more lumens, the brighter the light shines. LED light bulbs provide many lumens for fewer watts compared to incandescent bulbs. Since this is the case, it&#39;s better to find a bulb that has low wattage but high lumens because it will save you on your energy bill.","You also want to buy an LED light bulb that offers a long lifespan. Most LED lights last up to 22.8 years, or roughly 25,000 hours. The Lighting Facts label on the package shows how long the manufacturer claims the bulb will last as well as the amount of money it costs per year to run. These numbers are based on the industry standard of using the light for three hours per day each day of the year.","<strong>Bulb Characteristics</strong><br/>The dimensions of LED bulbs are similar, but not quite the same as a standard incandescent bulb. The average diameter and length of these LED lights is similar to that of incandescent bulbs but varies depending on the model. LED lights can also be heavier than incandescent bulbs, so you&#39;ll want to be sure that your light fixture can support the extra weight.","You can&#39;t enclose most LED light bulbs in a light fixture because heat decreases the life of the light bulb. If you plan to use your LED light bulbs outside, you&#39;ll first want to verify that they can withstand damp outdoor conditions. If you want to dim your lights with an LED light bulb, you&#39;ll need to have one that the manufacturer has specifically designed to perform as a dimmer.","Beam spread is another thing to consider. While incandescent lights put off light in all directions, many LED lights are designed to send their light in one direction. The best LED light bulbs that are comparable to 60-watt incandescent bulbs are omnidirectional, distributing the light around the bulb as well as from the top.","<strong>Color Spectrum</strong><br/>When you&#39;re looking for an LED light bulb, another thing to consider is the color of the light. Depending on where the light bulb lands on the color temperature spectrum, lights can be all colors, but the shades of white range from warm to cool white. The lower the color temperature, the more yellow your white light will appear. This type of light is referred to as soft white.","If the light is higher on the color temperature scale, it will appear to cast a cool, bluish hue, often referred to as daylight. Another aspect of light color is the color-rendering index (CRI). The higher the CRI number, the greater the number of objects that will appear natural.","<strong>Warranty &amp; Support</strong><br/>Chances are you won&#39;t need to be in contact much with the manufacturer to use your light bulbs. However, having a practical return policy and warranty are importance since these light bulbs cost more than incandescent and CFL bulbs. A good LED light bulb should come with at least a three- to five-year warranty, while the best LED bulbs have up to a 10-year warranty.","LED lighting presents a new, more environmentally friendly option for your home. The best LED light bulbs are long lasting and can save you money over an extended period. These lights will keep going long after incandescent and CFL bulbs would have stopped working, and they&#39;ll save you money on your electrical bill."]},"id":"08ca88e8-7209-4fa2-9a89-e335c10dce65","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"dfa6952b-3230-486d-b1be-d3663d50a477","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GGCASXU/?&tag=ttrledlightbulb-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|952[art|NA[pid|61330[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cree 9.5-Watt</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00APTS030/?&tag=ttrledlightbulb-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|952[art|NA[pid|61331[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Philips LED 425264</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTE8XC/?&tag=ttrledlightbulb-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|952[art|NA[pid|54602[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Feit 13.5-watt</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JHJGPBS/?&tag=ttrledlightbulb-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|952[art|NA[pid|61335[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sylvania 73014</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FQ7F6HY/?&tag=ttrledlightbulb-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|952[art|NA[pid|61336[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">GE 89888</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I134ORI/?&tag=ttrledlightbulb-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|952[art|NA[pid|61337[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Philips 433227</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"a2c914b4-81e8-4c51-b204-d7055fe2422c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_952","url":"/best-led-light-bulbs","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-04-18T19:48:01Z","datePublished":"2014-12-11T21:30:08Z","name":"LED Light  Bulbs Review","synopsis":"With incandescent bulbs on their way out, you can replace your bulbs with a cheap and environmentally friendly replacement—LED light bulbs.","review":{},"strapline":"With incandescent bulbs on their way out, you can replace your bulbs with a cheap and environmentally friendly replacement—LED light bulbs.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-01-21T00:54:22Z","id":"mW3KZNxM9aX2HEopbNDhWN","meta":{"title":"The Best LED Light Bulbs - Top Ten Reviews","description":"Which LED light bulb is right for you?
