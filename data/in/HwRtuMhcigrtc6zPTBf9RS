You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you&#39;re considering a BlackBerry Q10, you&#39;re probably looking for a phone with a physical QWERTY keyboard. In that case, the Q10 is your best <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> bet and an easy buy. Its keyboard is as comfortable as ever to type on, and with BlackBerry&#39;s 10.1 operating system, navigation is a breeze. You can use the touchscreen, or you can just type in app names on the keyboard, like &#34;email.&#34; The result is a phone that&#39;s very finger-friendly, but when it comes to common smartphone tasks such as watching video or navigating the web, it falls flat.","The Q10 is primarily a phone for communication. Be it writing an email, sending a message using BlackBerry messenger, or posting a quick social update, the device&#39;s always-there keyboard makes typing a joy. Unless or until you&#39;re used to it, however, your typing speed will probably slow down. Touchscreen keyboards often have word prediction, Swype-style letter selection and other methods you can use to speed your typing. The Q10&#39;s keyboard relies solely on your button-pressing skills. You can turn a predictive system on that will suggest words as you write, but you have to move your fingers from the keyboard to the screen to tap each suggestion. It&#39;s cumbersome enough that BlackBerry disables prediction by default.","With the physical keyboard taking up so much space on the phone, the Q10&#39;s touchscreen is much smaller that what you&#39;d find on other top smartphones. Offering 720-by-720 resolution on a 3.1-inch display, the screen is sharp, but small. Its square aspect ratio forces common widescreen videos to play with black bars above and below them, which makes a small screen feel even smaller. Even when browsing the web, you&#39;ll find yourself scrolling a lot more on the Q10 than you would on other phones.","As you would find on any modern smartphone, the Q10 has both front- and rear-facing cameras, but neither can compete with the lenses you&#39;ll find on the competition. Photos taken with the Q10 tend to be slightly noisy and fuzzy, and unimpressive in low light. If you&#39;re not much of a shutterbug you&#39;ll find them perfectly adequate, but Instagram fans should be wary.","Likewise, the BlackBerry Q10&#39;s processor is one of the slowest we&#39;ve tested. Startup and shutdown times are abnormally long. Games run poorly, often skipping frames or rendering 3D models without anti-aliasing, so their edges look jagged. And computations for things such as HDR photos, which the system has to combine from multiple exposures on the fly, take noticeably longer than they do on other phones."]},"id":"fd37376d-b156-4595-8d5d-fcd86bf0fc50","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1cc7829a-46b4-47b1-9651-2a1f7897b2bc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In the era of widescreen video, expansive mobile websites, pixel-sharp photography and graphically intense games, the BlackBerry Q10 is a disappointing smartphone.
