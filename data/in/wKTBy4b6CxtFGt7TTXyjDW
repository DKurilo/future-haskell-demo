We’ll provide additional information as it becomes available.<br/>","<strong><br/>Why Trust Us?</strong>","As we prepared for our air purifier review, we contacted the <a href=\"https://www.lung.org/\">American Lung Association</a>, the <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/\">California Air Resources Board</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.aham.org/\">Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers</a> (AHAM). We spoke with experts and read research from each of these organizations to get a good picture of whether air cleaners are useful and for advice on choosing the best one.","We also asked who benefits from cleaner indoor air. For example, we spoke with Janice Nolen, assistant vice president of national policy for the American Lung Association. She said &#34;people with asthma or allergies, especially children and teenagers, and older adults or people with cardiovascular problems.&#34;","However, Nolen also told us that &#34;removing the source of the pollution problem or adding ventilation [is] far more effective than plugging in a device.&#34; After taking steps to remove pollution sources and ensure good ventilation, Nolen suggests using an air purifier as a supplement to filter out airborne particles that can intensify asthma, allergy symptoms and cardiovascular conditions.","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We tested 10 air purifiers from the following brands: Coway, Electrolux, Heaven Fresh, Honeywell, Idylis, Kenmore, Rabbit Air, Vornado, Whirlpool and Winix. Because we don&#39;t have a reliable way to test air purification, we used the CADR scores provided by AHAM to judge the purifiers&#39; effectiveness. Instead, our in-house testing focused on noise levels and energy use.","To test the home air purifiers’ noise levels, we ran each machine at both its lowest and highest settings and, using a sound meter, measured how loud it was. Our tests revealed noise levels on low settings averaged around 30 dB, about the volume of a whisper. When we tested the highest settings, we found an average around 60 dB or greater, about as loud as a conversation.","Noise levels matter most when you plan to use an air cleaner in your bedroom, as loud machines can interfere with sleep patterns. However, if you use it in the kitchen during the day, noise levels aren&#39;t as much of an issue.","Our second test tracked how much energy an air cleaner uses on its maximum settings and what sort of effect that might have on your energy bill. We found these machines are inexpensive to use daily, as the least-expensive purifier costs only about $60 a year, or $5 a month.","The average energy consumption of the purifiers we tested is just above 90 watts. We based each model’s energy-consumption score on the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s (EPA) Energy Star testing results, with the exception of Vornado, for which we used the manufacturer&#39;s specifications.<br/><strong><br/>How Much Do Air Purifiers Cost?</strong>","Air purifiers for small rooms and personal use cost between $30 and $200. Larger air purifiers, like the ones in our comparison, cost between $200 and $300, though some premium models cost as much as $600. Additionally, you can expect to pay between $15 and $100 for replacement filters every few months with larger filters demanding a higher premium.","<strong>What Else to Look for in an Air Purifier?</strong>","Although CADR scores mostly measure purifier effectiveness, they can also tell you what room size a machine can handle. AHAM takes the smoke CADR score and multiples it by 1.55 to get an air purifier&#39;s suggested room size. For best results, an air purifier should cover a larger room than the one you use it in. Using an air purifier in a room larger than it can handle often makes it less effective or useless.","Air Changes per Hour<br/>Air changes per hour refers to how much air the purifier can clean in an hour, and it shows the machine’s airflow. The more times air passes through a machine&#39;s filters, the more likely they are to catch previously missed dust or pollen. For example, if you use a purifier rated for 500 square feet in a room that&#39;s 250 square feet, you essentially make two air changes every hour. All of the units we reviewed can do three air changes per hour, but we recommend getting a unit with at least four air changes an hour.","HEPA Filters<br/>The most important filter in an air purifier is the HEPA filter, which removes 99.97 percent of 0.3-micrometer particles and must meet rigorous regulations and industry standards. HEPA filters allow an air purifier to remove most pollen and fine dust from the air. You should plan to replace the HEPA filter in your home air purifier on an annual basis. Replacement HEPA filters are more expensive than other filters in your machine but don’t need to be replaced as often. Each air cleaner we tested uses HEPA filters.","Activated Carbon Filters<br/>This type of filter focuses on removing smoke and odors caused by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and is often used as a pre-filter to keep large airborne particles such as animal hair and dust from reaching the HEPA filter. These filters should be replaced three or four times a year.","Pre-Filters<br/>Although it’s common to see carbon filters fill this role, some air cleaners may have a separate pre-filter that you clean once a month using soap and water. It’s a good idea to check your air purifier’s manual to see if it has a washable pre-filter since other types of filters can’t be cleaned.","Warranty<br/>Most of the air purifier brands we reviewed, such as Whirlpool, Idylis, Honeywell, Winix, Rabbit Air and Vornado, have an outstanding five-year warranty. Unfortunately, Coway and Kenmore offer shorter three-year and one-year warranties respectively. While you can probably expect most air purifiers to outlast their warranties, longer warranties offer extra peace of mind that you won’t need to pay for replacement parts or defective machines sooner than you’d like.","As with all warranties, if there’s evidence of damage resulting from neglect, misuse or mishandling, the air purifier manufacturer might not honor the warranty. Additionally, some companies request that you fill out and mail in a registration card that comes with your product upon purchase to prevent out-of-warranty service requests.","Due to their disposable nature, there is no warranty coverage on the filters that come with your unit or replacement filters, just the purifier itself. This means that you need to rely on the retailer’s return policy if a filter arrives damaged.","Ionizers<br/>Ionizers charge particles as they move through the machine so they attach more easily to a filter or any other surface, thus removing themselves from the air. Ionizers are fairly common in air purifiers but controversial, as they produce trace amounts of ozone.","&#34;Ozone is an outdoor air pollutant,&#34; Nolen said, &#34;and it&#39;s a very dangerous pollutant that causes asthma attacks and has been linked now to cardiovascular disease and certainly causes premature death.&#34;","Due to the risks associated with ozone, the American Lung Association does not recommend using ionizers in your home. We suggest choosing an air cleaner without an ionizer or with one that you can turn off. We did not include it in our scoring.","<strong>How to Use an Air Purifier</strong>"]},"id":"4e65d7d2-8fd1-4667-8f75-7023e6b1569a","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Air purifiers work best when you leave them on, which gives them a higher chance of removing particulates from the air.

When external sources of air mix with the room’s air, it’s more difficult to get rid of pollutants and shortens the filter&#39;s lifetime.","You should use the highest setting to pull as much air through the filters as possible. You can use a lower setting if you need quieter performance while you sleep.","Place your air purifier near the edge of the room at least 18 inches from other objects and the wall. This reduces turbulence and allows air to flow around into the unit more smoothly. The air purifier should blow clean air toward the center of the room.","Replace the filters on a regular basis, as recommended by the manufacturer for each filter type."],"type":"ul"},"id":"967092a1-ada3-4185-ad9f-3fd47ce64173","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Air Purifier Alternatives</strong>","HVAC Filters vs. Air Purifiers<br/>There’s no doubt that the filter on your HVAC system can clear particles from your home’s air, but there are several reasons air purifiers are more effective:"]},"id":"53d5bde9-8d4d-47ae-b5e7-2cd14bd8b9c0","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<em>HEPA Filters</em> – Air purifiers incorporate HEPA filters to capture a majority of harmful particles in the air, including dust and pollen.

The activated carbon filter is responsible for removing smoke and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are the main source of many odors in your home.","<em>Operation Costs</em> – You can run an air purifier continuously without adding much to your utility bills, but HVAC systems aren’t designed to run that frequently. While HVAC systems have fan-only modes that circulate air throughout your home, they use more energy than an air purifier does.","<em>Different Purposes</em> – Air purifiers focus on cleaning the air, while HVAC systems focus on creating a comfortable environment. The primary purpose of a furnace filter is to protect equipment, and cleaner air is just a beneficial side effect."],"type":"ul"},"id":"3efca7b3-dff9-45a7-8c3b-757adee9c172","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite the drawbacks of using your HVAC system for air purification, it can adequately clean the air if you use a furnace filter with a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of at least 13, provided your system is rated for it. Filters with higher MERV ratings must be changed more often –since they&#39;re more effective at filtering the air, particles build up on them quicker, which can negatively affect your HVAC system’s overall performance.","DIY Air Purifiers<br/>Building a DIY air purifier is a cheaper alternative without HEPA and activated carbon filters, but it can be surprisingly effective against dust and pet hair. The simplest method involves square 20-inch furnace filters and standard box fans, which are a perfect fit for each other. To combine the two, place the furnace filter on the back of the fan where it pulls the air through the filter. This placement keeps debris out of the fan and the fan’s suction helps keep the filter in place.","Some furnace filters have an arrow on the side to indicate flow direction so this should be pointed at the fan. Put tape around the edges where the fan and filter meet to create a better seal and your DIY air cleaner is complete. Remember to change the filters following the manufacturer’s directions. Unlike normal air purifiers, this DIY setup isn’t a good option for places where you need a quiet room, but can be used anywhere in your home.","Plants as Air Purifiers<br/>Plants have been widely shown to improve indoor air quality. And although plants may not eliminate dust and pollen from the air, they can help remove VOCs and carbon dioxide. You can even increase the effectiveness of a plant’s filtration by using a fan to circulate the air around it.","If you want more information on the science behind plants as air purifiers, check out this article by our colleagues at Live Science: <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/38445-indoor-plants-clean-air.html\">Do Indoor Plants Really Clean the Air?</a>","Air Duct Cleaning<br/>Air duct cleaning may be another way to improve air quality in your home. Over time, air ducts in an HVAC system can accumulate dust and other particles, which has the potential to degrade air quality when the system’s running. In which case, having someone clean your air ducts seems like a straightforward way to improve air quality, right?","Unfortunately, there isn’t much evidence to support air duct cleaning as a viable alternative to air purification. For example, an <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/should-you-have-air-ducts-your-home-cleaned\">article on air duct cleaning</a> by the EPA states that “Duct cleaning has never been shown to actually prevent health problems. Neither do studies conclusively demonstrate that particle (e.g., dust) levels in homes increase because of dirty air ducts. This is because much of the dirt in air ducts adheres to duct surfaces and does not necessarily enter the living space.”","Despite pointing out the lack of research evidence in favor of air duct cleaning, the same EPA article <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/should-you-have-air-ducts-your-home-cleaned#deciding\">goes on to provide a fairly comprehensive guide</a> with situations where duct cleaning might be a good idea such as mold problems, vermin infestations and clogged ducts. It’s certainly worth checking out if you’re trying to decide if air duct cleaning is the right option for you.","Essential Oil Diffusers<br/>Some essential oil companies market products they claim can clean the atmosphere when diffused into the air. While the <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/52080-essential-oils-science-health-effects.html\">science of essential oils</a> is far from conclusive, some oils have antibacterial qualities that can help improve your home’s air quality. There’s also a case for using them to refresh your home’s air and to mask strong odors. Additionally, the strong smell of essential oils can have a positive effect on your mood. Despite the possible positive benefits, we don’t recommend essential oils as a replacement for an air purifier.","It’s important to note that essential oils are VOCs, so any air cleaner with an activated-carbon filter will likely pull them from the air. If you must use essential oils, you might consider turning the air purifier off or to a lower setting while your diffuser runs. Likewise, if you are allergic to any of the plants used to produce a particular essential oil, you should probably find an alternative.","<strong>Do Air Purifiers Really Work?</strong>","Yes, though they are not a cure-all for poor air quality in your home. As we mentioned earlier in our guide, removing sources of indoor air pollution and having proper ventilation in your home are often more effective solutions than air purifiers. However, an air purifier can still improve air quality, especially if you have asthma, allergies or a cardiovascular condition that makes you more sensitive to poor-quality air.","That said, you’ll get the best performance out of your air purifier if you follow some guidelines to eliminate indoor air pollution in your home beforehand:"]},"id":"f37ea9a6-f42c-428b-9165-2f421b52b444","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Vacuum your carpet three times a week. Vacuuming regularly helps prevent dust, dust mites, pollen, animal hair and other particles from building up in your carpet, only to get kicked into the air as you move through your home.

Ionizers are the only type of air purification that can potentially make you sick because they produce small amounts of a harmful gas called ozone.","According to the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/ozone-generators-are-sold-air-cleaners\">EPA</a>, ozone exposure can potentially cause symptoms such as coughing, throat irritation, chest pain, shortness of breath, inflammation in the lungs and decreased lung function. These symptoms can make you more vulnerable to respiratory infections. If you have asthma, you might experience more frequent asthma attacks.","With regard to the safety of other methods of air filtration, such as HEPA filters and activated carbon filters, these actually remove common contaminants that can make you sick. Because of this, there’s no risk of an air purifier making you sick when used properly, provided it doesn’t have an ionizing feature.","<strong>Do Air Purifiers Dry Out the Air?</strong>","The filters in air purifiers do not remove moisture from the air. The easiest way to tell if a device removes moisture from the air is to see if it has one of the following: a dehumidifier setting, a water storage tank or a drainage hose. Without a storage tank or drainage hose, there’s no place for collected water to drain, except onto the floor, which is a safety hazard.","If you’re concerned that the air in your home is too dry, you should consider getting a <a href=\"/best-humidifiers\">humidifier</a> to bring the humidity up to a more comfortable level. Humidifiers provide some of the same benefits you get from air purifiers. For example, they can relieve symptoms associated with asthma and allergies. You can use both devices together, depending on your needs. On the other hand, if the air in your home feels muggy, you might need a dehumidifier.","<strong>Do Air Purifiers Eliminate Odors?</strong>","Air purifiers are good at reducing or eliminating pollen, dust and other allergens, but are they any good at removing odors from your home? Our research indicates that not many are, as they would require specific carbon or “charged” filters to catch odors. In our tests, we did not specifically target odors, such as smoke, food or pet smells, but a <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2008/01/q-a-can-air-purifiers-get-rid-of-household-odors/index.htm\">study done by Consumer Reports</a> shows that the majority of their test purifiers didn’t remove odors, while the ones that did took over an hour to noticeably remove them. We also researched into the effectiveness of aerosol odor removers such as Febreeze and Lysol, and came to the conclusion that, while they do give more pleasant smells than the offensive odors you are wanting removed, they are better at masking smells rather than removing them. Many purifiers have odor removal features, but our recommendation is to not purchase an air purifier solely to remove odors.","<strong>How Long Does it Take an Air Purifier to Work?</strong>","The effectiveness of an air purifier depends on its rated room size. According to <a href=\"https://www.alencorp.com/pages/alen-air-purifier-frequently-asked-questions-faqs\">an article by Alen</a>, a manufacturer of air purifiers, an air purifier rated for 750 square feet will yield a measurable difference in air quality after about two hours, provided it’s used in a 750-square-foot room. Additionally, using the same air cleaner in a smaller 375-square-foot room will produce similar results in about an hour.","As we mentioned earlier in our guide, the air purifier needs to stay on, even after it cleans the air, for it to continue being effective. If you turn off the unit, the air quality will eventually go back to what it was before.","<strong>Glossary of Indoor Air Pollutants</strong>","Air purifiers can often remove the following airborne pollutants, though you can get better results by eliminating the source of the pollution if possible. The information below has been adapted from an EPA resource: <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/indoor-pollutants-and-sources\">Indoor Pollutants and Sources</a>.","<strong>Biological Contaminants</strong> - Biological contaminants can cause infectious illnesses and are potential triggers for allergic reactions and asthma. They are found throughout the home and include viruses, bacteria, pollen, mold, pet dander, pest droppings, mildew, mites and dust. Proper ventilation and HEPA filtration can help remove these from the air.","<strong>Particulate Matter (PM10 &amp; PM2.5)</strong> - These are small particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter (PM10) and fine particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5). Particulate matter in the air can lead to heart and lung problems or aggravate existing conditions. Particulate matter comes from cooking, burning candles, cigarette smoke, fireplaces, unvented heaters and some biological sources. Proper ventilation, HEPA filtration and activated carbon can help remove them from the air.","<strong>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)</strong> - VOCs are gases that can cause headaches, irritation (eyes, nose, throat), liver and kidney damage, and central nervous system problems. There is also evidence that some VOCs can lead to cancer. These gases come from most household products used for cleaning, disinfecting, hobbies, cosmetics, painting, wood treatments, pest control and car care. To some extent, these gases also come from furniture and building materials. Proper ventilation and activated carbon can help remove them from the air in your home.","More Guides to Help You Live Healthier:"]},"id":"beeee9b4-dff9-400e-ade6-a8b8461a1f3a","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-humidifiers\">The Best Humidifiers</a>","<a href=\"/best-mattress\">The Best Mattresses</a>","<a href=\"/best-light-therapy-lamps\">The Best Light Therapy Lamps</a>","<a href=\"/best-mold-test-kits\">The Best Mold Test Kits</a>","<a href=\"/best-water-filter-systems\">The Best Water Filter Systems</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"5ffcc47a-64e8-4f11-b169-7817827ff386","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_20","url":"/best-air-purifiers","authors":[{"email":"jcarlsen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-11T18:56:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-11T18:56:00Z","name":"Best Air Purifiers of 2019","synopsis":"We tested 10 air purifiers to find the quietest, most energy-efficient model and compared their Clean Air Delivery Rates (CADR).","review":{},"strapline":"We tested 10 air purifiers to find the quietest, most energy-efficient model and compared their Clean Air Delivery Rates (CADR).","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-11T20:42:45Z","id":"wKTBy4b6CxtFGt7TTXyjDW","meta":{"title":"Best Home Air Purifiers 2019 -
