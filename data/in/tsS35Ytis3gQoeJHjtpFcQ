Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","We&#39;ve anxiously awaited the U.S. release of the Xperia PLAY from Sony Ericsson, a device that&#39;s long been known somewhat incorrectly as the PlayStation Phone. Just imagine – it&#39;s a full-featured <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> and a genuine portable gaming console wrapped up in one convenient package. In large measure, we are not disappointed. It does satisfy the requirements of both these disparate roles, but not without some compromises along the way. As a gap-bridging device, it&#39;s very good. However, it&#39;s not the best hand-held gaming device on the market, and it&#39;s far from being the best smartphone available. Still, we think that the Xperia PLAY will be appealing to many smartphone users who are serious about their gaming.","The big news, of course, with the Xperia PLAY is the integration of a game console into the phone unit. Sure, just about any cell phone these days is capable of some game play, but you can only expect so much from a touchscreen phone. This device has a slide-out control panel that&#39;s clearly modeled on the PlayStation controller. You&#39;ll find the standard 4-way directional keys as along with the familiar square, circle, triangle and cross controls. The big difference is that, in place of the typical pair of joysticks, there are two circular, touch-sensitive pads. We&#39;ve always had mixed emotions about touch-sensitive controls, and these are not an exception. True, they work pretty well, but there&#39;s a degree of uncertainty and inconsistency. They work perfectly much of the time and then surprise the user with a misstep that can result in a gaming mistake. Joysticks they&#39;re not, and many users seem to quickly default to using the directional keys.","The Xperia PLAY comes pre-loaded with several games, including &#34;Bruce Lee: Dragon Warrior,&#34; &#34;Star Battalion,&#34; &#34;Madden NFL 11,&#34; &#34;Crash Bandicoot&#34; and others. You can download more games from the Verizon Wireless V CAST Apps Store and, since it&#39;s an Android device, from the Android Market. Note that not all games are compatible with the PlayStation-style controller, so you&#39;ll need to choose carefully in order to take advantage of this feature. Game play is excellent on the Xperia&#39;s bright and bold 4-inch screen.","The Xperia PLAY is certainly sleek when compared to the cell phones of yesteryear, but by today&#39;s standards, it&#39;s pretty bulky. Measuring 0.63 inches thick, it&#39;s the chunkiest device in our top ten smartphones lineup and is nearly twice as thick as much of the competition. It also weighs more than 6 ounces, which is pretty hefty by current phone standards. These figures aren&#39;t a big surprise given all that&#39;s packed into the unit, but it&#39;s worth knowing if you plan to slip it into a pants pocket or a nearly maxed-out bag.","Though the Xperia PLAY offers more in the gaming arena than other smartphones, some important features that we&#39;ve come to expect from a cutting-edge smartphone are conspicuous in their absence. Chief among them is the lack of 4G LTE functionality. Sure, 3G data was the gold standard not long ago, but that&#39;s changing at an ever-increasing pace, and 3G compatibility will likely seem rather dated by the end of a 2-year contract commitment. Although a highly capable 1GHz Snapdragon processor powers this smartphone, it too will likely become a limitation as dual-core chips quickly become the norm among the most powerful smartphones.","We expected this sort of phone to be a multimedia powerhouse, but there are some holes in that arena as well. The camera offers only average performance. While it is also a video recorder, it won&#39;t capture HD video. The front-facing VGA camera accommodates video chatting, but it doesn’t perform as well has more highly rated devices in this category. The Xperia PLAY would also be more versatile if it had an HDMI output to allow you to view the phone&#39;s display on a monitor or TV screen.","There are some notable positives too. The phone runs the newest Android 2.3 operating system. Sony Ericsson and Verizon Wireless have made some minor customizations to it, but we appreciate their minimal intrusion. The OS is great just as it is.","Predictably, the phone has Bluetooth connectivity, including stereo Bluetooth. It&#39;s also a social-media champ with integrated apps for YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Among our favorite features that aren&#39;t universally available is this phone&#39;s capability to function as a Wi-Fi hotspot for as many as five devices. The practicality of this feature is nearly limitless. We’re also particularly fond of the Skype app for VoIP telephony."]},"id":"ce061ae3-b060-40be-8d93-d57acc03879b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"29e4d7bc-f714-4620-a640-cf72fefcbade","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Xperia PLAY pushes the limits, expanding the type and number of video games beyond those that have previously been available on smartphones. The phone&#39;s PlayStation-like controller sets the bar higher than it&#39;s ever been for exciting game play on a phone. The hybrid device also performs well as a phone, though it has several technical limitations such as only 3G data transfer and a single-core processor that we expect will become dated relatively quickly. Nonetheless, for consumers who need the functionality of a smartphone but place great emphasis on high-quality mobile game play, this phone is hard to beat."]},"id":"55c51daf-da3d-4e72-832d-b50112740b11","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52893","url":"/xperia-play-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-05-24T18:18:12Z","datePublished":"2011-05-24T18:18:12Z","name":"Xperia PLAY","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":71,"verdict":"This is a major step forward for those who want great gaming on a phone, but there are compromises on both sides of the equation.","pros":["A brilliant display and excellent controller make this the new standard for cell phone gaming."],"cons":["The absence of 4G LTE is a disappointment in a media-intensive new smartphone."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-05-24T18:18:12Z","id":"tsS35Ytis3gQoeJHjtpFcQ","meta":{"title":"Xperia PLAY Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
