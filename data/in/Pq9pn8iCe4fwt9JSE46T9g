You can still read our original review below, but TopTenREVIEWS is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","We’d feel better about recommending the Tasco <strong>Discovery Microscope Kit</strong> if there was a bit more support to back it up. The Tasco label has been around for over 50 years in many forms. Currently it is being produced under the umbrella of Bushnell Outdoor products, its parent company.","Judging by their 2010 catalog, Tasco is not even making microscopes anymore, and that includes this one. Lots of other vendors do sell this product, however, so we wanted to research it and weigh it against other <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43718-best-microscopes-for-kids.html\">beginner microscopes</a>. You are sure to run across it in your search for the perfect instrument for the budding scientist in your life.","We feel this particular kids microscope kit belongs at the lower end of the lineup. It is our favorite of the bargain basement priced ones we saw in our search.","There is really quite a bit included for the price. If you are going to go for the under $20 range this is the scope to get. We still think it is worth investing a bit more for a kids microscope that will really last, but this set is impressive in many ways.","Tasco Discovery Microscope Kit includes a butterfly specimen, color filter, blank labels, cover slips, two prepared slides, four blank slides, shrimp hatchery, spatula, scalpel, tweezers, eye dropper, gum media, shrimp eggs, sea salt and eosin stain.","The inclusion of shrimp eggs was a nice surprise for a kit at this price point. Watching the eggs go through their various stages is fascinating for children. Do not expect great things from the optics on this kit, but you should be able to see some shrimp coming to life at the very least.","Between the stain and the color filter you should be able to see the maximum amount of detail that is possible.","We love that even at this price point Tasco included prepared slides. The children will love them. There is also a sturdy carrying case for on-the-road discoveries. A battery-powered light source will also add to portability.","Basic instructions are all you can hope to find in this particular kit, though it really won’t take much more than that anyway to get some great experiments going.","As mentioned before, there is not a lot of support from the manufacturer in the case of this product. Tasco is largely out of the microscope market. The Tasco brand was purchased in 2002 and that complicates things even more. But excellent retailers should be able to fill in the gaps for the most part, including Amazon.com.","We tried to get a few answers from Bushnell customer service but we could not get through. We never even talked to an actual person. This was on a weekday, mid-morning. We’re still not sure if they can answer technical questions about Tasco Discovery Microscope Kit but we’re pretty sure they can’t. They can’t even answer the phone."]},"id":"f0689512-844a-4a49-bcc2-06db78f99ba0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f8de7b88-fc8a-4dab-97b9-e039d04b20f3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This <strong>Discovery Microscope Kit</strong> has some pretty nice features, but the lack of support and iffy quality make it less of a solid option.
