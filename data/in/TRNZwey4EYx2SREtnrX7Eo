This <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-to-blu-ray-copy-software\">Blu-ray copy software</a> makes copies of full movies in the same amount of time it takes to view those movies. This speed is complemented by full-fledged decryption support that works without a third-party plugin. This enables you to protect your Blu-ray collection by copying discs for your own personal use. The program also includes basic video editing tools, such as trim, crop, effect and audio.","ByteCopy is great for making simple Blu-ray backups. It makes perfect clone copies of high-definition movies and copies Blu-ray disc data to our computer&#39;s hard drive with ease. The application also supports ISO disc image copying. These functions allow you to watch videos on your computer and protect your Blu-ray collection from disappearing due to scratches or other damage to the original disc.","The sound quality of the Blu-ray copies we created using Pavtube&#39;s Blu-ray backup software was amazing. In fact, we couldn&#39;t distinguish it from the original. Picture quality, however, was a different story. All of the detail visible in the original movie showed up in the copies we made, but the stunning clarity and striking depth-perception experience we saw in the originals was lacking.","The Blu-ray backup software from Pavtube is quick and easy to use. It opens with a simple interface from which you can find your Blu-ray or DVD file in a dropdown menu. You can then choose the output and conversion options you want, all without leaving the home interface.","If you run into problems while using this Blu-ray copy software, you can email the company to receive support. You can also check out the FAQs section to see if there are any solutions to the problem. The program&#39;s user manual contains thorough, in-depth information on how to perform certain tasks."]},"id":"7deb482f-7291-4855-af54-d3b4a5078a1b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e534350a-09c4-4c3a-b93b-ba989d2bd092","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Pavtube ByteCopy is a great application if you simply want to protect your Blu-ray disc investments by making backup Blu-ray copies.
