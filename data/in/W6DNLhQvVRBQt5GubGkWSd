You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Garden Spas Azalea <a href=\"/best-hot-tubs\">two-person hot tub</a> is a good fit for a single individual or a couple. It has both upright and lounge seating, and its jets give your body a full massage from your neck down to your feet.","This hot tub has a total of 21 jets, which is actually a lot for a two-person hot tub. The jets gives your body a complete massage while you sit back and relax in the lounging seats. Each seat has a handful of jets, and there are even jets along the bottom of the tub to massage your legs and feet.","The unit has an easy-to-use control panel with only four buttons. The control panel is on the edge of the unit near one of the seats, so it&#39;s easy to access without getting up out of the hot tub.","You don&#39;t get any extra features standard on this unit, but you can opt to add an LED system that turns your hot tub into an even more fun experience after dark. The lighting system includes multicolor LEDs that light the inside of the tub.","The pump on this outdoor hot tub is a 3-BHP dual-speed pump that circulates the water in your hot tub continuously and faster than a single-speed pump. This tub only seats two people, but there is a lot of room for those two people because the seats are on opposite sides of the tub, so you can sit back and stretch out. One of the seats leans back farther than the other so you can really relax.","The hot tub has a long and skinny design that measures 76 inches long, 46 inches wide and 32 inches high. This makes it easy to fit in even a small backyard or on a small deck, and it won&#39;t take up an overwhelming amount of space. You get a lifetime warranty on the unit&#39;s structure and a one-year warranty on the surface, electrical equipment, plumbing and the cabinetry of the unit.","The Garden Spas Azalea outdoor hot tub is small, but it is a great option for couples or single individuals who don&#39;t have a lot of space. This hot tub is small enough to fit into a small backyard without taking up a lot of room."]},"id":"1804710d-07ce-479d-b2a1-c4ebac7ebcab","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60796","url":"/garden-spas-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-15T17:38:41Z","datePublished":"2014-10-15T17:38:41Z","name":"Garden Spas Azalea","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
