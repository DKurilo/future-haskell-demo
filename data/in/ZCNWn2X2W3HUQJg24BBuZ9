For the most part, it sells DIY alarm monitoring plans that come with cellular monitoring and a basic selection of security devices. The company supports every standard alert and offers decent technical support.","The equipment selection of this DIY home monitoring company is quite good. The company has nearly everything you might need in a DIY home security system, from security cameras to glass-break sensors. The only equipment concerns come from an absence of recessed door sensors and starter kits. Although you buy the equipment for your system, DIY security does not disclose the pricing for each security device. Instead, you must call a sales representative to get pricing. DIY Security offers a pet-immune motion sensor but does not disclose the weight limitations of that device.","When a security device in your home senses a hazard, such as fire, smoke, intruders or other problems, the system sends a signal to the monitoring station. The monitoring station contacts you to verify that you need help and contacts emergency responders if you request so or if you do not respond. DIY Security supports every standard home security alert; however, the company doesn&#39;t offer a natural gas alert.","You can choose from four DIY alarm monitoring plans; the more expensive plans are able to support functionality that is more complex. None of the plans requires a contract and each comes with cellular monitoring, wireless equipment, nonstop monitoring and alarm status reports. For home automation, smartphone access, browser access and live video monitoring, you need to purchase one of the pricier service plans.","DIY Security relies on the original equipment manufacturer, Honeywell, to administer the warranty on your security devices. Honeywell&#39;s warranty varies from one to five years, depending on the device. You might find it bothersome to deal with an additional party to address warranty concerns.","DIY Security pre-programs your DIY home monitoring system before sending it to your home to minimize any problems installing the equipment. However, if you do have installation questions or problems, you can read the FAQs section and watch quick video tutorials. You can also contact DIY Security by phone and email. DIY Security does not offer a live chat support option."]},"id":"7ba9e2f0-3ebf-4c91-a355-b9c2b0817d49","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"70bf260d-4eb6-4842-b27a-54790fccd483","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["DIY Security sells most of the everyday security devices, which can protect your family in nearly every emergency.
