You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The RS622 <a href=\"/best-robot-lawn-mowers\">robot lawn mower</a> by Robomow can automatically keep your lawn looking great with its heavy duty motors and 22-inch mowing width. It’s only capable of handling lawns up to 0.5 acres, however, so isn’t suitable for large, sprawling areas.","With 400 watts of mowing power, the Robomow RS622 robot lawn mower uses up to four configurable mowing zones to take care of your lawn. It has a 26-volt lithium-ion battery that works for between 50 and 65 minutes on average on a single charge. Recharging the battery takes between 90 and 135 minutes, however, which limits the amount of available mowing time.","This robot lawn mower has a modular design, which makes it easier to change parts as needed. The mowing blades, for instance, are easily changed without requiring any additional tools. They snap on and off, so you don’t need to break out the toolbox or take the mower to a shop to have the blades replaced.","The Robomow RS622 robot lawn mower has a rain sensor that detects moisture. When it rains, the mower stops what it’s doing and returns to the charging station to prevent damage to itself. Sudden showers may not give it enough time to return to its base, though, so checking the weather beforehand is essential. It has a floating deck so that rough terrain doesn’t result in an uneven cut.","Robomow’s RS622 robot lawn mower is energy efficient as well. It only consumes about 25 kilowatts of energy per month during its recharging cycles. However, the more you use the mower, the more energy it consumes, so if you frequently mow your lawn, your electricity bill may increase.","Robomow makes iOS and Android apps available to RS622 robot lawn mower owners. This app enables you to remotely control the mower as well as see crucial information such as charging status and remaining battery life. The app supports both GPS and Bluetooth and lets you change or set mowing zones, adjust cutting settings and move the mower between areas.","The Robomow RS622 robot lawn mower is a good choice if you have a smaller lawn but don’t want to manually mow. With its smartphone compatibility, this mower makes it easy to take care of your grass. It does have a somewhat long charge time, though, so keep that in mind when deciding on a mower."]},"id":"017c5873-a780-4583-93d6-ff2674e8bc8a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63708","url":"/robomow-rs622-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"danny-chadwick","url":"/author/danny-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Danny Chadwick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"DhF8Hg8QQde8MtLyq8X8JN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-25T21:11:03Z","datePublished":"2015-03-25T21:11:03Z","name":"Robomow RS622","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-25T21:11:03Z","id":"Nwsa2F8Ha6h2QWNJAPnxiL","meta":{"title":"Robomow RS622 Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Robomow RS622 can handle lawns up to 0.5 acres with a 26-volt lithium-ion battery that works for 50 to 65 minutes on a single charge."},"products":[{"slug":"robomow-rs622","url":"/product/robomow-rs622","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:16Z","name":"Robomow RS622","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:16Z","id":"GNiv7adQUMpxmLo2fkJejk","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:16:16Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/FP6kBkDoNKYTaRyWDCkUQA.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:16Z","mimeType":"","name":"63680-robomow-rs622-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63680-robomow-rs622-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:16Z","id":"FP6kBkDoNKYTaRyWDCkUQA","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FP6kBkDoNKYTaRyWDCkUQA.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Robomow RS622 Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Robomow RS622 can handle lawns up to 0.5 acres with a 26-volt lithium-ion battery that works for 50 to 65 minutes on a single charge."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/FP6kBkDoNKYTaRyWDCkUQA.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:16Z","mimeType":"","name":"63680-robomow-rs622-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63680-robomow-rs622-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:16Z","id":"FP6kBkDoNKYTaRyWDCkUQA","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FP6kBkDoNKYTaRyWDCkUQA.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Robomow RS622 Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Robomow RS622 can handle lawns up to 0.5 acres with a 26-volt lithium-ion battery that works for 50 to 65 minutes on a single charge."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/outdoor/best-robot-lawn-mowers/robomow-rs622-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:16Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:16Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"lawn-mowers","url":"/home-and-garden/lawn-mowers","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:16Z","name":"Lawn Mowers","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:16Z","id":"smr57URmWPEAAvpHn7aR9h","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
