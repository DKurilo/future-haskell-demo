The original review is below, but check out our current</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/mobile/accessories/best-bluetooth-car-kits/\">Bluetooth Car Kit Reviews</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The SonicRider is Motorola&#39;s most affordable Bluetooth hands-free car kit. As such, it lacks many of the features and call quality found in Motorola&#39;s more expensive Bluetooth car speakerphones. While the design is simple with only four buttons, learning to use it effectively is complicated because it lacks voice commands. Many of the functions and features can only be accessed by pressing the call button in sequence with the other buttons. It can be difficult to operate without taking your eyes off the road.","The best feature of the Motorola SonicRider is the battery life, which is capable of 45 hours of talk time and five months of standby time. If you only use it for the rare phone call on your commute, then you may only need to recharge it twice a year. For comparison, the second best battery life is 20 hours. Since you can use it while it&#39;s plugged into the charging port in your car, you&#39;re not likely to ever run low on power.","Another good feature is the advanced multipoint pairing, which allows you to have two devices connected to it at the same time. This is great if you use a work phone and a personal phone or if you have a passenger who wants to use it.","The main reason the SonicRider doesn&#39;t compare to the best Bluetooth car kits is the call quality. While the speaker has the necessary power to make sure you hear every word of a conversation, it lacks HD voice. Instead, it relies on the standard frequency range of 150Hz to 3.4kHz, which is only a fraction of the frequencies produced by the human voice. This results in a call quality that sounds thin and tinny, which is the standard for a phone call. Bluetooth hands-free speakerphones with HD voice expand the frequency range to cover 50Hz to 7kHz, which produces a more realistic-sounding voice.","Another flaw in the call quality is the unidirectional microphone. The best Bluetooth car kits use multiple microphones, because this allows the internal digital processor to more effectively recognize and filter out background noise and echoing. A unidirectional microphone reduces background noises by narrowing the focus of the microphone so that it only picks up the audio that it&#39;s focused on. Unfortunately, this also means that you have to have your head positioned perfectly in that narrowed focus for your caller to hear you. Stray outside that focus and your caller will think you&#39;re 30 feet from the microphone."]},"id":"8df4154e-2f92-4e41-a615-93254c0fde44","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"833712f2-ea48-44cb-9e06-2075ba24b96c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Of all the Bluetooth car kits, the Motorola SonicRider has the best battery life with the longest talk time.
