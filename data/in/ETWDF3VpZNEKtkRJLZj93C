You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Sun Joe SB600E electric trimmer actually doesn&#39;t use a string to cut with; however, it has the same general design as an <a href=\"/best-electric-string-trimmers\">electric string trimmer</a>, so we put it in this category. Instead of a string, it uses a flexible, plastic blade that spins in the same fashion as a string to cut grass and weeds. The Sun Joe electric trimmer also converts to an edger.","At 7,700 rotations per minute (RPMs), the Sun Joe electric trimmer isn&#39;t the fastest trimmer you&#39;ll come across. Although it&#39;s slower than other electric string trimmers, it still has plenty of speed to get the job done right. The Sun Joe electric trimmer also uses fewer amperes (amps) to run. The power you&#39;ll get in this trimmer is 4.5 amps. The Sun Joe SB600E connects to an extension cord, which isn&#39;t included with the electric weed trimmer.","As we mentioned before, this electric weed trimmer uses what the company calls a SharperBlade to trim away unwanted grass and weeds. The blade gives you a cutting swath of 12.6 inches. An edge guard extends a little past the end of the blade so you can keep track of what you&#39;re cutting and what you&#39;re preserving.","To keep you comfortable while you&#39;re trimming and edging, this electric weed trimmer adjusts in height from about 3.5 feet up to about 4.5 feet. It also has two handles, one of which is adjustable, to give you a stable grip on the Sun Joe SB600E. To keep you safe, Sun Joe has included a safety switch on its trimmer that you have to press when you first start the trimmer. That way, you don&#39;t accidentally start the trimmer before you&#39;re ready.","Assembly includes attaching the front-facing handle by connecting the included knobs, as well as inserting the edge guard, shield and SharperBlade. The Twist-N-Groom Shaft makes it easy to adjust the trimmer into an edger. The maintenance instructions suggest cleaning the entire Sun Joe trimmer after each use to keep it working well and to avoid mold.","You can obtain an electronic version of the manual online. It walks you through the process of assembling your Sun Joe trimmer. It also gives you instructions on how to operate the machine safely. The warranty covers the product in case of defect for two years.","We called Sun Joe to learn more about the product. The customer service representative had a model of the trimmer in front of him that he could reference, as well as product information in paper form, to answer our questions. Sun Joe has a relatively short hold time as well. Customer service was not as prompt in replying to our email, however."]},"id":"b1d21601-2b57-4caf-a704-d11145ae0e9c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"62343f3c-cf7f-4193-a43d-5826e986f132","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sun Joe SB600E electric weed trimmer has enough power and speed to buzz through grass and weeds.
