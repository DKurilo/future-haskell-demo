This software comes with a library of over 200 recipes, which means you can try out a number of dishes before adding your own. However, this Mac recipe program lacks certain functions, such as a reference tool and a nutritional analyzer, which can be extremely useful, especially if you’re looking out for the nutritional needs of a big family.","This Mac recipe software has a clean, easy-to-use interface and is easy to navigate. Drag-and-drop options are available in nearly every capacity, which makes creating shopping lists and moving recipes into categories a breeze. YummySoup offers very specific search options, which is necessary when you build a large recipe collection. You can search for keywords in a recipe&#39;s name, directions, yield, description, source, prep time, cook time and more. Unfortunately, you cannot search more than one field at a time, as you can with the more advanced search functions found in the best Mac recipe programs.","YummySoup allows you to create notes, which is a small feature but really helpful in the kitchen. You can remind yourself what you liked or didn’t like about a certain recipe. You can share your notes with others to help them get the edge on certain recipes. This Mac recipe software also includes a simple scaling tool that allows you to adjust serving sizes.","This recipe manager for Mac automatically generates a list of your favorite recipes based on your ratings and whether or not you mark the recipe as &#34;prepared.&#34; The option of marking a recipe as &#34;prepared&#34; is a unique feature among the Mac recipe software programs we reviewed, and it helps you organize the recipes further and continue to try new ones, rather than simply making the same meals every week.","The program offers a weekly menu planner that allows you to plan your meals out a week in advance. It also has a smart group option, which allows you to create a filter that finds all recipes that meet certain criteria, including rating, difficulty and the standard search criteria. These groups are saved in a separate folder for quick reference. The software lacks a monthly menu planning option, however, if you’re someone who likes to plan way ahead.","The online support for YummySoup is extensive and includes video tutorials, a quick guide and an email address. The quick guide has detailed photos and easy-to-understand instructions for the basic functions of the program. The video tutorials are very helpful, and if you still have questions or concerns, you can contact the developer via email."]},"id":"03fcbb13-47dd-4d41-a006-6f7e667d6972","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2c2f8e6e-65d2-4322-906f-0d953cf573c9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["YummySoup is a good option for Mac recipe software.
