This behemoth weighs 20 pounds and applies up to 950 grams of force while cutting. The size contributes to its large cutting width. Even the smallest version of the Maxx Air cuts materials up to 15 inches wide. This is the widest reach of any die cutter on our lineup and larger than most sheets of cardstock. It can cut through just about anything, from delicate tissue paper to sheet metal. If you want to use your <a href=\"/best-die-cutting-machines\">die-cutting machine</a> for more than just scrapbooking and cards, this machine could be the right match for you.","Because of its size, this is the least portable unit. It&#39;s relatively heavy, lacks a handle or tool storage and must be connected to a computer in order for it to work. If you like to take your hobby on the road, the MAXX Air is not a good option. This die cutter could stay in one place and accomplish plenty, though. Besides cutting, it can draw, pierce, engrave and emboss. It can also cut a very wide range of materials, including cardstock, vinyl and tissue paper. It can also handle heavy-duty materials like balsa wood, leather and sheet metal.","You can use either Make the Cut or KNK Studio software with this unit. KNK Studio allows you to control the order in which you cut the lines in your design and offers other sophisticated operations. For instance, you can cut out a face on one color of paper and clothing on another color â€“ there are some fun options with this cutter.","There is definitely a learning curve with this unit, but we found Klic-n-Kut customer service to be quite responsive. It&#39;s one of the few manufacturers to offer live chat, and the only one we ever found to be staffed. We received timely responses to email inquiries too."]},"id":"b1a5bebd-3d3e-45da-a944-adf3f16679a8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ece04294-2aa2-428b-bfc9-cd41e9b95073","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With 950 grams of cutting force, the Klic-N-Kut MAXX Air lets you cut through a wide variety of materials with relative ease.
