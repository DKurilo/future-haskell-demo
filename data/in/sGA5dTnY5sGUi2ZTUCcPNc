You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Arrowmounts AM-T102MB is a durable and sturdy wall mount that allows you to secure most flat-panel plasma and LCD TVs to your wall. This mounting device is sleek and slim, and it&#39;s a good fit for most television sets measuring 32 to 50 inches. This wall mount allows you to tilt the television set, which helps you to minimize glare.","The mount is made out of solid heavy-gauge steel. It can support TVs up to 100 pounds, which is certainly less than many <a href=\"/best-tv-wall-mounts\">TV wall mounts</a>, but very few TVs weigh more than 100 pounds. It’s a double-stud installation, which means it mounts to two studs. The mounting bracket fits 16-inch and 24-inch studs.","The mount features lift-and-hook installation, making the process quick and simple. All of your mounting hardware is included with the TV wall mount, which means you do not have to gather or buy any accessories. It also features snapping wall brackets to aid in the installation process and a built-in level, which helps ensure you don’t hang the TV like a crooked painting.","The TV wall mount sits approximately 2.36 inches from the wall. This provides a crisp and clean look. A horizontal adjustment bar on this device allows you to adjust how the TV rests on the mount even after it has been installed, allowing you to slide the TV left or right for optimal viewing. However, we were disappointed to see there are no cord management features on this product, which are used to contain and hide all of those pesky cords.","We were impressed with the help and support Arrowmounts provides. It offers email, telephone and live chat support to answer any questions or concerns. It also provides an installation guide to assist you through the entire process and ensure you get the most from this TV wall mount.","The Arrowmounts AM-T102MB is a good option for a TV wall mount. It provides a slight tilt to the TV to reduce glare and can support heavy TVs up to 50 inches. This TV wall mount offers several advanced features, including a built-in bubble level and a steel design. It lacks a few features that we like to see in the best TV wall mounts though, including cord management and a stud finder."]},"id":"19cfd330-baf3-415a-a1af-ff437fa928b2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65478","url":"/arrowmounts-am-t102mb-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-06-09T17:34:51Z","datePublished":"2015-06-09T17:34:51Z","name":"Arrowmounts AM-T102MB","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":88,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-06-09T17:34:51Z","id":"sGA5dTnY5sGUi2ZTUCcPNc","meta":{"title":"Arrowmounts AM-T102MB Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Arrowmounts AM-T102MB is rated to fit TVs up to 50 inches and hold up to 100 pounds.
