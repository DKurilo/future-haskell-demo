You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Large capacity is generally regarded as a selling point, but not everyone has a sprawling laundry room. If you need a <a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\">compact front loading washer</a>, we recommend the LG WM1388W. It has less than half the drum capacity of some of the front load washers we compared, including the family-sized Samsung DV50K7500, but there is still plenty of room for most households&#39; laundry needs. It can fit up to 12 pounds of laundry. A complete outfit for an adult usually weighs 3-5 pounds so this washing machine could fit almost a full work week&#39;s clothing comfortably at a time.","This unit is designed to be compact enough that it will fit in almost any space. It measures just 24 inches wide, which is 2.7 inches smaller than the average unit in our front load washer reviews. This may not sound like much, but if you are limited on space a few inches can make all the difference. Stacking the LG WM1388W with the <a href=\"https://www.lowes.com/pd/LG-4-2-cu-ft-Stackable-Ventless-Electric-Dryer-White/1000129725?AID=10926682&amp;PID=4134430&amp;cm_mmc=AFF_CJ-_-4134430-_-1158153-_-10926682\">matching dryer</a> saves you even more laundry room floor real estate.","This LG washer can still do a fair amount of laundry, including lots of different types. There are 14 different wash programs for different scenarios – Delicates, Sanitary, Baby Wear, Permanent Press, Speed Wash, Sports Wear, Tub Clean and others. You can also add to the cleaning capabilities through prewash and extra rinse options.","This front load washing machine is smart. With LG&#39;s app, you can download cycles and ask questions. You can also cut down on the inconvenience of service calls using the Smart Diagnosis feature and your smartphone. None of the smart features can save you from your own forgetfulness, but the pause button can. You can hit it after a cycle has stopped and add a piece of clothing that got lost in the shuffle.","This compact unit is a decent bet for energy efficiency, though there were actually a couple washers that had slightly lower estimated yearly energy costs in our comparison. The Energy Guide for this LG front load washer indicates that it will cost about $14 a year to run when used with an electric water heater. Other units we reviewed had estimated annual costs of up to $18.","The LG WM1388W might not be the best option if you have a large family, but it works great for apartments, condos and smaller homes. This is a very compact unit but still includes some advanced features, like an impressive selection of wash cycles and integration with your phone for easier diagnosis and repair, when needed. If you need a bigger machine, check out the <a href=\"/samsung-review\">Samsung WF50K7500AV/A2</a>."]},"id":"77a370f0-19e6-4b01-95b5-0676ee7793e8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68911","url":"/lg-compact-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-12-14T18:15:23Z","datePublished":"2016-12-14T18:15:23Z","name":"LG Compact WM1388W","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":25,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-11-02T00:00:00Z","id":"kgcizVsKn6d9d9Whxt5aPH","meta":{"title":"LG Compact WM1377HW Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The LG WM1388W fits nicely into small spaces but has a surprisingly large capacity.
