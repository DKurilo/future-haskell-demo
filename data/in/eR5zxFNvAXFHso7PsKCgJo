However, if you own a Nintendo 3DS or a PlayStation Vita, you may want to know what&#39;s in store for your <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1340-best-handheld-consoles.html\">handheld game console</a> in the coming years. This year&#39;s E3 conference focused primarily on the new home consoles, but with the promises from Nintendo and Sony for their handheld consoles, the near future holds some exciting games and updates for mobile gaming.Â ","Beginning with Nintendo&#39;s 3DS family, Nintendo focused on games and apps this year. The company seems to be taking a page from &#34;Skylanders&#34; and &#34;Disney Infinity&#34; with its new &#34;Amiibo,&#34; a toy-based game coming to the Wii U and 3DS in the future. This means that you can use the figurines on either your home console or mobile platform without losing your progress. Next, &#34;Super Smash Bros.&#34; will launch first on the 3DS with some exclusive content. This is the first time that the chaotic fighting game is coming to a handheld console. The last multi-platform game announced was &#34;Sonic Boom,&#34; with &#34;Shattered Crystal&#34; coming exclusively to the 3DS.","Nintendo revealed several other games that will only come to the 3DS family of handheld game consoles. This year&#39;s E3 saw the announcement of &#34;Pokemon Omega Ruby&#34; and &#34;Alpha Sapphire,&#34; &#34;Pokemon Art Academy,&#34; &#34;Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate,&#34; &#34;Fantasy Life,&#34; &#34;Shovel Knight&#34; and &#34;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call.&#34; The last game was a surprise, since many thought it would be exclusive to Asian markets. There were no announcements of price drops, new hardware or remote play updates to the 3DS lineup. Still, that is a solid list of games to look forward to.","Sony spent considerably less time on the PlayStation Vita. The biggest announcement was the news that PlayStation Now, Sony&#39;s game streaming service, will launch on the Vita, PS3 and select Bravia TVs later this year. Unfortunately, Sony has not revealed the subscription price for Now, but we do know that rentals will cost $3 to $5 for most games. Also, Sony revealed a publishing partnership with Devolver Digital to bring &#34;Broforce,&#34; &#34;Titan Souls,&#34; &#34;Not a Hero&#34; and &#34;Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number&#34; to the PS4 and Vita. Other Vita game announcements included &#34;Tetris Ultimate,&#34; &#34;Entwined,&#34; &#34;Tales of Hearts R,&#34; &#34;Child of Light,&#34; &#34;Tales From the Borderlands,&#34; &#34;Minecraft: PlayStation Vita Edition&#34; and a remake of &#34;Grim Fandango.&#34;","Both handheld consoles have lots of games coming over the next couple of years, many of which are yet to be announced. It&#39;s a great time to be a mobile gamer."]},"id":"ee30b041-233e-47b3-b5c0-775bb12f4b66","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8535","url":"/the-future-of-handheld-game-consoles","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ben-davis","url":"/author/ben-davis","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Ben Davis","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"L52JmDizAnNgRQPUr9kch6","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-06-23T21:26:29Z","datePublished":"2014-06-23T21:26:29Z","name":"The Future of Handheld Game Consoles","synopsis":"When the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One launched after the Nintendo Wii U, most of the gaming industry turned to watch these new consoles.","review":{},"strapline":"When the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One launched after the Nintendo Wii U, most of the gaming industry turned to watch these new consoles.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-11-18T23:21:07Z","id":"eR5zxFNvAXFHso7PsKCgJo","meta":{"title":"The Future of Handheld Game Consoles","description":"While most of the gaming industry focuses on the brand new consoles, Nintendo and Sony don&#039;t want you to forget about handhelds with their E3 promises."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:59:21Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/HJ3NruWoztrT4x9HLo4YDZ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:59:21Z","mimeType":"","name":"8535-the-future-of-handheld-game-consoles.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/8535-the-future-of-handheld-game-consoles.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:59:21Z","id":"HJ3NruWoztrT4x9HLo4YDZ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HJ3NruWoztrT4x9HLo4YDZ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"The Future of Handheld Game Consoles","description":"While most of the gaming industry focuses on the brand new consoles, Nintendo and Sony don&#039;t want you to forget about handhelds with their E3 promises."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/HJ3NruWoztrT4x9HLo4YDZ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:59:21Z","mimeType":"","name":"8535-the-future-of-handheld-game-consoles.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/8535-the-future-of-handheld-game-consoles.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:59:21Z","id":"HJ3NruWoztrT4x9HLo4YDZ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HJ3NruWoztrT4x9HLo4YDZ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"The Future of Handheld Game Consoles","description":"While most of the gaming industry focuses on the brand new consoles, Nintendo and Sony don&#039;t want you to forget about handhelds with their E3 promises."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/articles/the-future-of-handheld-game-consoles/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:59:21Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:59:21Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
