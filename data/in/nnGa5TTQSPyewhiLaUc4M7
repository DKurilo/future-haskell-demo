Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/smart-home/best-smoke-detectors/\">Smoke Detectors</a> here.</em>","The Kidde KN-COSM-BA is a wireless smoke detector that operates fully on battery power and does not require connection to your home’s electrical system. In addition to an ionization sensor that detects the presence of flaming fires, it also comes with a carbon monoxide sensor and a voice alarm that identifies the specific danger detected.","This smoke detector’s combination smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) alarm includes a voice alarm that tells you the nature of the hazard detected. It should be noted that carbon monoxide detectors may not be necessary in your home unless required by law or if you use fuel-burning appliances. CO detectors may also not be required in all rooms of your home.","One feature missing from this smoke alarm is photoelectric smoke detection, which works better with detecting smoldering fires before they have ignited. The Kidde KN-COSM-BA is equipped with a different technology, called ionization smoke detection, that better detects the presence of flaming fires. Having dual-sensor capability is a feature only shared by the best smoke detectors on the market. For more comprehensive coverage against the danger of smoldering and raging fires, it’s recommended that you use this unit in conjunction with photoelectric detectors. Alternately, you can purchase a smoke alarm with dual-sensor capabilities.","The KN-COSM-BA is battery powered and operates independently of other units. One of the benefits of this wireless smoke detector is that it can be installed in areas of your home that are not hardwired to your electrical setup and in older homes that have not been configured to accept hardwired smoke detectors. However, its inability to interconnect with other smoke detectors means that only the alarm exposed to smoke or CO will be activated. This increases the risk that you may not hear it go off if it’s installed in an area of your home that’s far removed from the general living and sleeping areas.","A single button on the main face of the unit silences the alarm if it’s tripped. You can use the same button to test the alarm function. Although the detector will sound a small chirp every 60 seconds when the battery is low, it also includes an LED indicator light that flashes to provide added visual notification. The voice alarm also informs you if your battery is low. The alarm comes with a 10-year manufacturer warranty. Help and support are offered via website FAQs, telephone and email."]},"id":"63097417-36a0-4391-8d37-94f8701275fe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"68957ddd-a67e-406d-a76c-17cbbc5303d4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kidde KN-COSM-BA wireless smoke detector works well in homes that have not been configured to accept hardwired smoke detectors.
