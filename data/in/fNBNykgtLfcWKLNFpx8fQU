You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Napoleon FreeStyle <a href=\"/best-infrared-grills\">infrared grill</a> has a sturdy build quality, good warranties and solid power output. However, it isn&#39;t the best infrared grill available because it lacks in the areas of heat consistency and grilling experience.","The Napoleon FreeStyle is all about power. Its 14,000-Btu ceramic infrared burner preheats to 500 degrees Fahrenheit in less than a minute, so you can start cooking almost immediately. This is more than twice as fast as the next-fastest infrared barbecue grill in our review. The power does no favors for the FreeStyle&#39;s heat consistency, though. In fact, it has the lowest heat consistency among the grills in our review. The grill produces extreme heat in the center over the burner with relatively little heat along the edges of cooking surface, which means its small grilling surface limits you further.","This is the only grill to fail our long consistency test. After seven minutes on low, the burner temperature came in at 900 degrees. Many grills in our review cannot achieve that temperature on high. At the end of our 20-minute test, the grill&#39;s temperature exceeded the maximum of our laser thermometer, more than 1,000 degrees. This means this grill is not suitable for extended roasting, and you could overcook delicate cuts of meat or undercook thick cuts easily.","When we cooked chicken in our tests, we had to use thin cuts, because the grill would char the outside too much before the food was cooked inside, leading to a lower grilling experience score. It cooks steak very well, though, better than some of the best infrared barbecue grills in our review. The power of the Napoleon FreeStyle is a great tool if you know how to use it properly, but it is unpredictable if you&#39;re new to infrared barbecue. Overall, we had a much better cooking experience with the <a href=\"/weber-genesis-review\">Weber Genesis II LX</a>. ","This is the only tabletop infrared gas grill in our review with a warming rack, which helps when you want to cook chicken further from the burner. This grill&#39;s cooking space is the largest among the portable infrared grills we tested at 215 square inches. You can purchase a conversion kit to allow the grill to run on natural gas. The build quality of the Napoleon FreeStyle matches that of the best infrared grills. Its heavy-gauge stainless steel design is one of the most durable in our review. The cooking grates have similar quality but can be difficult to clean when coated with cooked-on food.","The Napoleon FreeStyle has one of the best warranties in our review. Napoleon Grills covers the cooking grates, cookbox and lid with a lifetime warranty. The infrared burner and other components have a two-year warranty. You can find user manuals and FAQs on the Napoleon support site and direct support via email and phone."]},"id":"241f08ed-b29d-44d8-9472-94820481c556","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c21e1e56-f7b9-42a4-9ee4-2584d0ab070b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Napoleon FreeStyle delivers power and quality.
