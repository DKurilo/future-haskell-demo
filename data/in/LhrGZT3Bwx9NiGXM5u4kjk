You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Many budget <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphones</a> deliver mediocre performance housed in a flimsy plastic case. However, this phone is the exception to the rule. As a budget phone, the Motorola Atrix HD offers a fluid user interface and an excellent HD display without sacrificing high-quality casing and performance.","A unique design of DuPont Kevlar and Corning Gorilla Glass houses the Motorola Atrix HD. The glass covering the touchscreen is solid and durable. However, the Kevlar is nothing more than an aesthetic addition. The edge of the body is plastic, framing the Kevlar in the center of the back of the phone. Also on the back, the camera bulges out of the top, making it awkward to hold. Fortunately, the awkward grip of the body does not take away from the fantastic 4.3-inch HD touchscreen. With bright screens and accurate colors, the display is a major selling point for this smartphone.","The Motorola Atrix HD uses an 8MP rear camera, able to shoot full 1080 HD video. On the top, an HDMI port allows you to plug your phone directly into your television to view your pictures or watch your videos. However, the camera takes subpar photos, even in well-lit locations, and the video recording pauses between certain frames, creating a choppy look. The Atrix HD cannot make high-quality media to show off to your friends, but its HD display makes viewing movies or playing games a pleasure.","As a phone, the Motorola Atrix HD offers clear quality and great noise cancellation. The standby button is located above the volume buttons, and adjusting the levels of phone calls will take some getting used to. The speaker used during conference calls is clear, and the phone&#39;s near-field communication with Bluetooth devices maintains a strong signal and connection.","The battery is surprisingly weak. While other smartphones deliver over 12 hours of performance on a single charge, the Atrix HD manages only about 8 hours of average use before needing its charger. If you plan to use your phone to surf the web, watch HD videos or play games, you&#39;ll want to keep a charger with you. The phone comes with a tiny 8GB of internal storage space. A memory card will give you more storage space for files and programs. The small amount of installed storage and the weak battery are major disappointments and will both be frustrations if you&#39;re a heavy user.","The Motorola Atrix HD uses Android 4.0 and comes with a slew of pre-installed apps. The phone operates smoothly with the help of its dual-core, 1.5GHz processor. During heavy use, the Atrix HD can get hot, but in normal situations, the processor will blast through all operations without producing much heat. This phone is extremely approachable, with its easy user interface and powerful performance"]},"id":"7bac3147-4fb7-4413-a3cd-cc9450515ce2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d6694ca8-9ea3-495a-97f0-0fc18aaa3ffa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Motorola Atrix HD delivers HD video, fantastic casing and excellent computing power for a much lower price than many other smartphones.
