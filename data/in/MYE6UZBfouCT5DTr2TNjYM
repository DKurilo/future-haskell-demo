We decided that in a day when even some smartphones can record video in ultra high definition (UHD) 4K, that our comparison should include camcorders with that upgraded technology. The Panasonic HC-WXF991 has a Crystal Engine 4K image processor that supports 4K UHD video at 24/30 frames per second and 1080p video up to 60 frames per second.

Using rankings from seven reviewers, this camcorder got an A- for overall video quality and clarity. It was about 30 degrees Fahrenheit when we did our outdoor testing, and this camera did turn off a few times at random while we tried to record video. We also had our video experts run the footage through the editing software Adobe Premiere Pro and evaluate the color using RGB graphs on the program. We rated this camera a B- in color correctness because the outdoor footage had some higher blue levels which gave everything a slight gray appearance.","Zoom lenses can really make a camcorder stand out. This Panasonic model has a 20x optical zoom, which is low compared to other models we tested. Optical zoom gives you the best-quality magnified image by adjusting the camera’s lens. This camera’s 60x digital zoom merely crops whatever you’re seeing through the viewfinder, resulting in a more pixelated video.","This camera also has intelligent zoom, which is a combination of optical and digital zoom but still isn&#39;t quite as clear as a straight optical zoom.
