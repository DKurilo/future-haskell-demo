When it comes to removing snow, you need a device that can pick up any type of snow and clear your walkways. Weighing in at 25 pounds, this device is lightweight. Toro recommends using a 100-foot extension cable for powering this single-stage snow blower. Depending on where you can plug it in, this may be limiting if you have a long driveway or sidewalk. However, for homes with shorter driveways or small paved spaces, it will prove an ideal length.","The <a href=\"/best-snow-blowers\">snow blower&#39;s</a> 18-inch clearing path and 12-inch cut depth should easily handle daily snowfall. The discharge chute can become clogged when clearing wet snow, which means you need to consider lowering the cut depth to discharge less snow. This may require more passes through a paved area, but it also means fewer clogs. Unfortunately, Toro does not include a clearing tool to help you safely remove built-up snow and ice.","A common problem among snow throwers is the amount of noise created by the machine’s engine, but with electrical power, you can utilize the Toro Power Curve 1800 without ear protection or disturbing your neighbors as you plow in the early morning hours.","Apart from cleaning out the discharge chute on occasion, the rest of the snow removal equipment operates well without regular maintenance. In the absence of a gas engine, you don’t have to worry about fuel buildups deteriorating the machine’s overall performance.","The Toro Power Curve 1800 is one of the best electric snow blowers out there due to its compact design, usability and low maintenance requirements. Its wide clearing path and sizable cut depth make snow removal easier. Provided you don’t find the presence of a power cable problematic, the Toro 1800 can save you time removing snow as well as money from purchasing gas."]},"id":"37151973-ebde-4f4d-86ea-1774138f2fde","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57505","url":"/toro-1800-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-09-14T14:53:07Z","datePublished":"2013-09-14T14:53:07Z","name":"Toro 1800 Power Curve","synopsis":"The Toro 1800 Power Curve may not be the most powerful snow blower on the market, but it is easy to use and handle.
