Still, at only about 20 inches square, it doesn’t take up a lot of space and has wheels for moving around easily. This solar panel kit has five solar panels that slide out from the main cube and a 1500-watt AC inverter. This will power appliances above and beyond smartphones or laptops. The Wagan Solar Cube could provide electricity for a television, microwave or even a conventional refrigerator.","The design is comprehensive. Unfolded, it’s about the size of a luggage carry-on. Similarly, it has a collapsible handle and wheels for moving around. The cube itself is pure white with a gray base for the control center. The portable solar power system even has a small storage compartment on the bottom for accessories or additional plugs.","There is no assembly required with the Wagan Solar Cube 1500. It comes fully assembled out of the box and offers the option to add additional solar panels if you need more storage. The manufacturer states that a full charge will take around 18 hours in direct sunlight. The Wagan Solar Cube is environmentally friendly. Unlike generators that run on gasoline, there are no fumes and little noise when it’s in use. This means your camping trip won’t be disturbed by the constant buzzing of an engine.","The Wagan Solar Cube has several outlets. There are two 115-volt AC outlets, two 12-volt accessory outlets and two USB ports. You can check the battery status with a digital LED voltmeter. You can plug in several devices at once without worrying about power surges or overcharging.","This is an especially helpful solar kit in the case of an emergency. If the power is out in your area for an extended period of time, a full charge can provide needed information on your television or radio while simultaneously powering your phone and laptop. It is easy to store away in your closet and could provide critical refrigeration for food.","This is an all-in-one solar panel kit that doesn’t need extra accessories and comes with several plug-in options. The design makes it convenient to move around, and the compact solar panels that fold out don’t require a lot of time reading a manual. It’s not something you could carry around for extended periods, but it offers a lot if you’re willing to pay a higher price."]},"id":"13bfd239-a72d-45a1-a3b1-0949b4425c99","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61712","url":"/wagan-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-18T22:29:57Z","datePublished":"2014-12-18T22:29:57Z","name":"Wagan Solar Cube 1500 EL2546","synopsis":"At 84 pounds, the Solar Cube 1500 is not exactly the kind of portable solar generator you can store in your backpack or keep in your pocket.
