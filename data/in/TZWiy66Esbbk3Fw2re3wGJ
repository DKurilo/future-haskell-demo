You can choose your network, bring your own phone and create a custom plan based on the services you use most. A savvy customer can save money on US Mobile by only paying for the minutes, texts or data you need. Plus, all its plans are flexible, allowing you to top up mid-month or change your plan anytime.","<strong>Network</strong>","US Mobile has two network options, Super LTE through Verizon and GSM LTE through <a href=\"/t-mobile-review\">T-Mobile</a>. There are some small price differences between these options in the custom plan options, but unlimited plans are only available on the Verizon network option. When deciding between these plans, check coverage and network performance maps to see which network best covers where you use your phone. Verizon has the largest network in the U.S., but T-Mobile also has decent coverage, especially in urban areas. Both have fast data speeds, but one may outperform the other, depending on where you live.","If you want to keep using the phone you have now, only one of the networks is compatible. <a href=\"/verizon-wireless-review\">Verizon</a> and T-Mobile use different cellular technologies, so if you have a phone from Verizon or Sprint, go with the Super LTE network. If you have a phone from T-Mobile or AT&amp;T, go with the GSM network.","<strong>Plans</strong>","US Mobile is extremely flexible and lets you skip out on any part of a plan you won’t use. You can opt for any combination of talk, text or data with a custom plan. It’s also easy to change things up. With any plan, you can add minutes, texts or data mid-cycle if you find you need more, and you can change your plan month to month if you foresee different usage needs.","Unlimited plans are all pre-set and do not have customization options, but there are nine plans to choose from. US Mobile offers three tiers of data speeds, 1Mbps, 5Mbps and uncapped speed. Within each speed tier, you can choose from limited talk and text, unlimited talk and text and unlimited everything plus hotspot data.","US Mobile is expensive on the unlimited end of the spectrum, compared to other prepaid carriers, especially if you factor in the cost of multiple lines. Wireless companies like MetroPCS offer discounts on multiple lines, but US Mobile does not. US Mobile’s value comes from its custom, limited plans that lets customers pay only for what they use.","<strong>Carrier Features/Extras</strong>","US Mobile does not have a great variety of phones available to purchase, but since it operates on two different networks, almost any phone is compatible. One downside is the lack of international calling. You can also only have one line per plan, though you can combine plans under one account.","US Mobile’s custom plans can save you money on two of the nation’s best cellular networks if you keep track of your talk, text and data usage. Though on the expensive side for prepaid unlimited plans, its limited, personalized plans offer buckets of service for reasonable fees."]},"id":"0174b393-66b6-4d42-92bf-a6a22b76a44e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68283","url":"/us-mobile-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-29T13:57:06Z","datePublished":"2016-08-29T13:57:06Z","name":"US Mobile","synopsis":"US Mobile is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) prepaid phone carrier that lets you personalize almost everything about your plan.","review":{"rating":85,"verdict":"US Mobile is a completely customizable service that puts you in control of your phone bill.
