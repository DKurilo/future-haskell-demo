However, it&#39;s one of the more expensive models we looked at, costing nearly $200.","The EVC350 is one of the more powerful portable evaporative coolers we researched. It can cool rooms up to 175 square feet, though it may be able to spot cool in larger spaces. This unit has a maximum airflow of 350 cubic feet per minute (CFM), so it circulates air better than a few of the other coolers we reviewed.","Efficiency is the Arctic Cove EVC350’s main selling point – it&#39;s more energy efficient than most portable swamp coolers. In fact, only large outdoor units like the <a href=\"/hessaire-review\">Hessaire MC18M</a> and <a href=\"/honeywell-review\">Honeywell CO60PM</a> are more efficient. The EVC350 uses only 63 watts of electricity, and as such, it costs around $5.50 to run during the three summer months.","At 3 gallons, the Arctic Cove EVC350 has a comparatively large water tank. Also, the cooler alerts you when the water level is low, and the tank is easy to slide out of the back to refill.","The EVC350 has a few useful features, including a remote control and a shut-off timer. There is also a convenient slot on top of the unit to store the remote in. The control panel on the front of the machine has an LCD display to help you choose the right settings.","This portable evaporative cooler weighs only 17 pounds when empty, so it’s easy to carry to wherever you need it. You can also move it using the swiveling wheels on the bottom, which are particularly useful if the water tank is full. While it isn’t the smallest unit we looked at, it&#39;s attractive and not much larger than a tower fan, so it blends into most rooms. As with most portable evaporative coolers, this unit has a one-year warranty."]},"id":"d06c0a2f-9c6a-4db2-85d3-831f47be47e2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69899","url":"/arctic-cove-evc350-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-04-30T13:28:09Z","datePublished":"2018-04-30T13:28:09Z","name":"Arctic Cove EVC350","synopsis":"The Arctic Cove EVC350 is one of the most efficient portable evaporative coolers we've seen, and it’s also quite powerful compared to similar units.","review":{"rating":86,"verdict":"The Arctic Cove EVC350 is an attractive, efficient portable evaporative cooler, though it&#039;s slightly more expensive than average.","pros":["The Arctic Cove EVC350 is very efficient for its size."],"cons":["It&#039;s more expensive than similar coolers."]},"strapline":"The Arctic Cove EVC350 is one of the most efficient portable evaporative coolers we've seen, and it’s also quite powerful compared to similar units.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-09T00:00:00Z","id":"HbYvWkrWnXn3RZaozDDGEj","meta":{"title":"Arctic Cove EVC350 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Arctic Cove EVC350 is an attractive and efficient portable evaporative cooler, though it&#039;s slightly more expensive than average."},"products":[{"slug":"arctic-cove-evc350","url":"/product/arctic-cove-evc350","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:09:34Z","name":"Arctic Cove EVC350","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:09:34Z","id":"CXaG7kYuDjQBb8bWJLdkCL","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:09:34Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/j4x6wKsqMrGk939xFU3znE.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:09:34Z","mimeType":"","name":"db32eb4ee1d6664187c346ba152182c6.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/db32eb4ee1d6664187c346ba152182c6.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:09:34Z","id":"j4x6wKsqMrGk939xFU3znE","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j4x6wKsqMrGk939xFU3znE.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Arctic Cove EVC350 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Arctic Cove EVC350 is an attractive and efficient portable evaporative cooler, though it&#039;s slightly more expensive than average."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/j4x6wKsqMrGk939xFU3znE.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:09:34Z","mimeType":"","name":"db32eb4ee1d6664187c346ba152182c6.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/db32eb4ee1d6664187c346ba152182c6.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:09:34Z","id":"j4x6wKsqMrGk939xFU3znE","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j4x6wKsqMrGk939xFU3znE.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Arctic Cove EVC350 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Arctic Cove EVC350 is an attractive and efficient portable evaporative cooler, though it&#039;s slightly more expensive than average."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/hvac/best-portable-evaporative-coolers/arctic-cove-evc350-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:09:34Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:09:34Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"air-conditioning","url":"/home-and-garden/air-conditioning","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:09:34Z","name":"Air Conditioning","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:09:34Z","id":"pVrs4zPdxV4QVcV5FoWtAd","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
