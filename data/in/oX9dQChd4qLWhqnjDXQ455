Marvel and independent comic creator Steven Sanders uses Adobe Photoshop as one of his dominant comic book software choices. Adobe Photoshop CC allows you to access and create designs from any computer, smartphone or tablet, since files are saved and stored in Adobe&#39;s Creative Cloud database.","Though not usually seen as a comic maker program, Photoshop CC 2019’s wide toolset makes it a great option for creating your own comic books, graphic novels or anime. It has all the tools you need to make great backgrounds or other 2D images. You can easily upload photographs and, with a little photo editing magic, create vector art and use them as unique parts of your designs.","Photoshop CC includes illustration tools to create 3D images including freeform shapes, and shading tools to make them look more realistic. You can also see all edits in real time. This comic maker has round, rectangles and other shape pads that can be edited individually or simultaneously to help proportion each together in your design. Pencils, pens, paint and pattern brushes are also available. Since this program was created primarily for photo editing, it doesn&#39;t provide any character templates. If you want a comic book software that lets you draw from scratch and only requires a one-time payment, we recommend Clip Studio Paint Pro or Clip Studio Paint EX.","As with many comic maker programs, Adobe Photoshop CC’s focus on design and illustration leaves you to create scripts with other programs. While you can include some basic text in your comic books, this program really wasn&#39;t designed for typing long stories. It won&#39;t spell check your words or prompt when grammatical errors are found. You will need another word processing program for this part of your work, just like the pros do. We recommend Final Draft as a good companion software.","Photoshop CC 2019 has all the features found in past versions of the software but with some feature enhancements. . This comic maker software lets you create, use and edit layers. Additionally, you can use the  Adobe generator included with Photoshop CC to create image assets, capture layers and image sections, and create image files of those selected parts with a quick click of your mouse.","Each time you make a change to your comic book, Photoshop CC automatically saves your image as its own file, so you will always have a folder with all of your up-to-date images. This means you can go back to an earlier or later version, or view side-by-side variations of images to decide which works best for your comic creation.","One feature that is only included with Photoshop CC is the camera shake reduction tool. All cameras create a little blurring, since it is impossible to keep any camera 100 percent still. Photoshop CC automatically determines the path of the camera shake and reduces the blur of your images to produce amazingly clear photographs. Clear images are important if you want to superimpose or transfigure them into vector art images.","Since Photoshop CC is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud service, your image files will be automatically saved to a secure cloud network. This means you can access your files remotely from any computer, smartphone or tablet. This makes bringing work along on vacation easier, since you don&#39;t have to lug your laptop around. Simply access your artwork from the hotel, library or hostess&#39; computer when you have a few minutes to work on your design. This also allows friends, family, coworkers and editors to access images through their devices, if you give them access to your files.","Unfortunately, Adobe requires a monthly subscription in addition to the purchase of Photoshop CC in order to save and allow access to the Creative Cloud files. One of the best things about Photoshop CC is that it supports every file imaginable, including PDF, PICT, TIFF and PNG. You can easily convert your files into other formats that are more compatible with friends&#39; or editors&#39; viewing programs. You can also choose to save images in a file that is compatible with Facebook and upload them to the site straight from the Photoshop CC program.","<strong>What’s New In Photoshop CC 2019?</strong>","Recently, during the Adobe Max convention in October 2018, Adobe announced that it would be adding additional features to make the software more intuitive. One of the updates I found most impressive is the increased control you have over the Content-Aware Fill tool. This tool basically allows you to quickly remove unwanted elements from your photos. For example, you can remove trash or people in the background and the fill makes the space around the removed object appear as though nothing had been there in the first place. To increase the accuracy of the fill, the update allows you to specify exactly what areas of the photo you want the fill to pull from as well as the areas you want it to avoid. This is very helpful with comic book creation if you’re editing real photos to look like drawn art or if you want to quickly remove an object that you painted into the background.","Though small, there are also a few keystroke and process changes in CC 2019 that will make learning Photoshop a little easier. In the past, if you wanted to click and drag to transform an object to scale, you had to press Shift while changing the size. From now on, you no longer need to use the Shift key to change the size of your image to scale. This might take a little getting used to from long-time Photoshop users, but it will make learning the software a tad easier for beginners. Photoshop CC also features a Flip View function that allows you to flip your design to better recognize imperfections and mistakes. In the 2019 version, you can now enter Flip View without making changes to the document itself. While it doesn’t seem like much, many of the small changes to Photoshop CC 2019 make the creation process faster when added together.","A new feature that many artists will appreciate is symmetry painting. You can quickly make mandala kaleidoscope designs in this feature, which can make stunning backgrounds or cover art pieces for your comics. To better learn how to use the features of this software, beginners can access the Learn Panel to develop skills. It even allows you to practice and learn techniques on sample assets or on your own files.","Adobe Photoshop CC is available for Windows 7 or higher. It is also compatible with Mac. You will need an internet connection to access the program for download and to get to your saved files in Creative Cloud. Make sure you have at least 1GB of RAM available on your electronic device, since this program does take up a fair amount of processing power.","You can access your design files everywhere from most any electronic device with Adobe Photoshop CC, though a monthly subscription is required. Both 2D and 3D designs are easily created with the array of design tools available. Though not typically seen as a comic creator, Photoshop CC can be a great choice for creating or adding effects to your own comic books. This software is often used by professional comic book artists to create hand drawn figures and backgrounds from scratch."]},"id":"2c638a5f-86cb-4dbc-9dd4-b9beb77e3d3f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57779","url":"/photoshop-cc-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-14T20:27:28Z","datePublished":"2013-10-14T20:27:28Z","name":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2019","synopsis":"&nbsp;It is nearly impossible to create a great comic book from scratch without using multiple programs, since most are either illustration- or script-specific.
