You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With the <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">digital camera for kids</a> industry booming users have a number of choices to sift through before finding the perfect one for the child in their life. If your child is a Dora the Explorer fan the  Dora Talking Digital Camera for children could be your answer. However, if you are looking for the most child-friendly digital cameras, we suggest you check out the KidiZoom Plus, the Fisher-Price Kid Tough Digital Camera and the Pix Jr. Digital Camera – Disney’s digital camera for kids.","Perhaps the best feature on this digital camera for children is that it has Dora on the front. That and the three short sayings that generate each time a picture is snapped. Besides that the picture quality is very low even compared to other digital cameras for kids, which also do not have a high resolution. Another frustrating factor about this product is that the viewfinder does not line up evenly to the lens which makes the pictures off center or cuts certain things out completely.","Despite the flash there are really no other features. It comes with a very basic software package that allows you to edit images and play games on the computer. This may not be something your child will be able to use on their own.","The camera has a very basic design. It can hold 120 pictures and doesn’t have a slot for external memory capabilities. It weighs five ounces and takes two AAA batteries. It was designed for kids four years and older and we recommend sticking close to the four- to five-year age range. Older kids may not be pleased with the quality or the lack of features.","Overall it is easy to use. As we mentioned above the kids will struggle getting a picture perfectly centered because the viewfinder and lens do not line up perfectly. There is also no viewing screen on the back for the kids to view images or to look at while they take a picture so they must use the viewfinder. There is a small screen on the back that displays the number of pictures remaining. This is a great tool but also can be confusing for kids to try and use on their own.","We were not impressed by the customer service that Sakar provided. Using the toll-free phone number provided on their website we waited about five minutes to be connected to a representative. Once we were connected the representative was very short with us on the phone and appeared to not want to help. None of our questions were answered and the representative didn’t seem to even try to find the information we requested."]},"id":"0b2822ce-c20d-43d0-ac16-e2a943377317","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4e17cffb-4058-4e64-b3c8-09821d7e4e27","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sakar-created Dora digital cameras for children provide low quality pictures and have no screen for kids to view images that they have taken.

The company may have tried to create a unique product that kids would enjoy and the sayings were a great place to start. From there the quality goes down drastically and the company doesn’t do a great job standing by its product.
