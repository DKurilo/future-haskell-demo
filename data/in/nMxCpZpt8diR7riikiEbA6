While its membership fee is lower than some of the other sites we compared it to, you can only listen to one audio book a month, and you can’t buy more credits or use money to purchase additional books. It also doesn’t have as many audio books in stock as the best subscription services.","Your Scribd membership comes with some titles that are available for unlimited download, but many of them are in the public domain and can be found multiple places on the internet like LibriVox.org. For the most part, the best audio books and newer, popular titles aren’t available in this section.","This service is better for traditional readers who want to pay less for eBooks from month to month. The $8.99 membership fee gets you three eBooks, one audio book and unlimited access to sheet music and documents, which is a better deal than Amazon’s Audible. But with an audio book library of around 70,000 titles, compared to Audible’s 180,000 plus offerings, Scribd just can’t compete.","I compiled a list of 100 of the most popular and best books from 2016 and searched for them on each site I tested to get an idea of the kinds of titles each has available for download. Scribd had about 50 percent of the books I searched for, which is fewer than most other sites.","Scribd also only has one membership option. While there’s an argument that sites simplify their offerings to make them easier to use, sites that allow users to select one of multiple membership plans are better. That way, users can get access to a library they like while selecting a membership that fits their listening style.","Scribd has a modern, good-looking website, but it’s not always intuitive to use. Sometimes it’s difficult to tell what to click on, and some pages are missing menus, which can help users more easily navigate to different areas of the site.","When I cancelled my free trial membership, I lost access to the book I’d been listening to on the site. This limitation really hampers Scribd’s value because many of the memberships we looked at allow you to continue accessing your library, even after you stop paying the monthly fee.","While it’s nice to shop whenever you want online, deciding what to read next can be frustrating and time consuming. The best sites have recommendations and suggestions as well as customer reviews and publisher summaries to help you find books you will like quickly. Scribd has all these features. It also lets you put books on your Wishlist so you can come back and listen to them later.","One problem with the Scribd model is the added pressure of only having one credit to spend each month. I didn’t want to use my credit on something I didn’t want to keep, so I spent more time shopping on this site than some of the others. It was nice to have a five-minute audio clip on each book’s profile page to help me decide, but this is a standard feature on most of the sites.","Because the service sells both eBooks and audio books, there were a couple of times I landed on an eBook page rather than one for the audio book I was looking for. You’ll want to be careful navigating this site to make sure you don’t confuse them. There’s a small audio symbol on the audio books that doesn’t really stand out on the cover. While Amazon allows you to change the medium right on the product page, you must search to find other versions on Scribd.","The Scribd app’s design isn’t as clean as <a href=\"/audible-review\">Audible’s</a> or <a href=\"/audiobooks-com-review\">Audiobooks.com’s</a>. It’s not very colorful, which can make navigating from one area to another challenging. You can select new audio books to listen to from the app – a feature only a few other sites offer.","The service’s app is missing some of the standard features found in most popular audio book apps. For example, it doesn’t have a sleep timer, which lets you set a time for your device to stop playing so you don’t get too far from your place in the book if you drift off to sleep while listening. We didn’t have any problems with playback or resuming our spot in a book when we switched devices.","The service uses Digital Rights Management to protect its files from being copied and reproduced. To avoid misuse, you can only use three different computers or browsers to listen to audio books online in a 24-hour period. You can also download audio books in the application on four different devices such as your tablet or your phone.","It is harder to return books to Scribd than to some of the other audio book sites we reviewed. Rather than having the listening guarantees sites like Amazon offer, which let you return your audio book if you’re unsatisfied with it, Scribd requires a documented error, such as a bad download or content missing from the book, to make a return. You also need to contact the company within 30 days of your purchase.","Scribd doesn’t offer support over the phone, but it has a very responsive email system. The company’s FAQs page is thoughtful and has a useful search engine."]},"id":"19967bc7-21a0-463e-910b-ff7491bfd515","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"10a265f3-ebad-429b-a844-6ae696c87374","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Because you can only select one audio book title a month to add to your library and Scribd has a limited store, there are better services out there for audio book fans.
