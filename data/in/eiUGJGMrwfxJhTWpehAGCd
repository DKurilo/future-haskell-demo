While the program isn&#39;t quite as robust as other landscaping software, it&#39;s easy to use and has great-looking plants and other landscaping library objects. Its main focus is to allow you to take a photo of your home and drag 2D images onto it for a rough idea of what your front or backyard designs can look like.","Landscape Vision is easy to use. This is one of its strengths, as you can simply drag items onto your property picture and resize them as needed. It is a do-it-yourself landscaping tool that does not have an over-abundance of features or tools to learn. Its simplicity can be a weakness because you will not have sophisticated tools, including any 3D features, at your disposal.","Landscape Vision contains basic features such as digital photo importing tools that allow you to build a landscape around your home. The program also offers a comprehensive, well-designed foliage library for front yard landscape design and other choices that includes detailed plant descriptions, accurate photos and interesting information on over 1,000 plants. Landscape Vision’s plant library was one of the most detailed of any landscape design products that we reviewed. Also included is a United States hardiness map, so you know which plants will work best in your climate.","To add landscape features to your property, such as trees, you must first &#34;mulch&#34; the area. Plants and feature images are resizable, but you must use a menu option to do this; you can’t simply grab and stretch images. Also, you cannot age plants to see how your landscape will appear years down the road. That is a fairly common feature among most competing products so it is frustrating not to find it in Landscape Vision."]},"id":"857d831a-9576-4458-ad39-46c63148f9cb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"41841429-6f7f-4886-b30d-2717f474770f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Landscape Vision simply gives you a vision of a design possibility, without bells and whistles.
