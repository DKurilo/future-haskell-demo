Regardless of the subscription you pick you’ll never have to deal with commercials, which is one reason it’s our best pick alongside the free one-month trial. <br />\n <br />\nAnother reason Netflix is so great is its intuitive interface. All of your entertainment options are displayed on tiles, and you can search for specific content by genre, actor or title. When you sign up, you’re prompted to select movies and TV shows you’re interested in so the Netflix algorithm can suggest content you enjoy and display it right on the home screen. This might not be everyone’s favorite way of seeing what content is available, but you might appreciate being exposed to titles you wouldn’t have found otherwise. There are also award-winning Netflix originals you can watch, like \"Orange Is the New Black,\" \"Master of None\" and \"The Crown.\" All of the content is available on your desktop or smartphone via the free app. <br />\n <br />\nNetflix also has a section of content just for kids, making this service a great option for families. Along with the kid’s movie section, which includes content from Disney, you can set parental controls to make sure your children don’t have access to inappropriate content. Depending on the subscription package you select when you sign up, you can rent two Blu-ray discs or DVDs at one time.

It's less expensive than an Amazon Prime membership, which gives you free two-day shipping on qualifying purchases, Prime Video, Prime Music and access to the Kindle lending library. While the two memberships are different, you can get all the Amazon Prime perks during your initial 30-day trial period.<br />\n <br />\nNow that’s out of the way, let’s talk about what’s on TV. You can watch content through your desktop browser or smartphone app, and if you want to save it for later, just add your favorites to you watchlist. You can search specifically for content for kids too and turn on parental controls so nobody can make purchases with the credit card you have on file. One final aspect of Amazon Prime Video we really enjoyed is the button you can hit to skip forward or backward by 10 seconds. It’s ideal for skipping any TV show intros or the boring monologue you don’t need to hear.<br />\n<br />\nWe’ll admit this streaming service has its flaws. The layout is really busy and the search feature returns options you can’t actually stream but have to buy on DVD instead. But aside from a few hiccups, you get a lot with your membership. We found plenty of movie titles – including more obscure ones – and there aren’t any commercials. There is also quite a bit of original content to choose from along with current cable TV shows. There are some movies you have to rent to watch, but the subscription included several titles we were interested in.<br />\n<br />\nYou’re also greeted with an overlay displaying the cast and other information when you hover your mouse over the browser, so you’ll always know who’s on-screen. With the great array of content and the potential to bundle Amazon Prime perks, it’s really a great value.","<a href=\"/amazon-instant-video-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"ed38f169-8ecd-4406-b74d-b189c44c0cfc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best TV Show Selection"},"id":"45ac44eb-6b22-42c1-9270-1a305973e38f","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/cd7enhVXM4uX9UdiCgoP2E.jpg","link":{"href":"https://www.toptenreviews.com/services/entertainment/best-internet-tv-sites/hulu-review/","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/W/6/790422/original/Movie-TV-Streaming-Hulu.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cd7enhVXM4uX9UdiCgoP2E.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"cd7enhVXM4uX9UdiCgoP2E","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cd7enhVXM4uX9UdiCgoP2E.jpg","alt":"Hulu"},"id":"3ed322e4-73ea-47a3-ba52-7bd9217b396e","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Hulu\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/hulu-review\">Hulu</a>","pros":["App is well-designed","Ongoing cable TV shows available","Award-winning original content"],"cons":["Content can be glitchy","Live TV costs extra","Even “no commercial” option has a few commercials"]},"id":"5d66aacc-1ac3-471a-96c3-593d852b520d","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With several subscription packages to choose from, Hulu gives you access to a lot of recent releases.","We tested out the newly designed website, which works smoothly and includes a skip button so you can fast forward or rewind by 10 seconds.

That, along with limited or no commercial interruptions, make streaming a great option. The downside is many streaming websites don’t offer current TV programming you usually find on cable or live TV. DirectTV NOW is the exception, but it’s also a pretty expensive service. On the other hand, while you might not be able to watch the most current episode of “The Bachelor,” some streaming services – like Netflix – release entire seasons of TV shows at once, allowing you to watch everything in one sitting. Other streaming services, like Hulu and HBO NOW, only release one episode at a time. You’ll have to choose what’s best for you."]},"id":"0ca37520-4394-4c81-9a57-f0edfc08318e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/6Mu69Ab6YDaNsJswBqBw2N.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/streaming-sites-testing-1/w/711/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9YLzIvNzkwNDU0L29yaWdpbmFsL01vdmllLWFuZC1UVi1TdHJlYW1pbmctU2VydmljZXMtVGVzdGluZy0wMDIuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Mu69Ab6YDaNsJswBqBw2N.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"6Mu69Ab6YDaNsJswBqBw2N","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Mu69Ab6YDaNsJswBqBw2N.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e05c894a-a55a-47e9-b1ff-3e9897e1f276","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Streaming vs. Pay Per Title<br/>Streaming websites require an internet connection, so your viewing experience is only as good as your internet. You aren’t downloading the media files, so you need an internet connection to watch any content. If the website has a pay-per-view model where you can buy titles and download them, you will be able to watch your movies and TV shows whenever you like whether you’re connected to the internet or not. If you have particularly slow internet at home you’re going to experience glitchy streaming and slow downloads, but it’s no fault of the website.","It’s on TV!<br/>Most TV and movie streaming websites require you to sign up on a computer or through an app on your phone. If those screens are way too small for your family’s movie night, there are numerous ways to get the picture from your device to your big screen TV. If you plug a Google Chromecast or Amazon Firestick into your TV, you can cast your video wirelessly. Apple TVs or Amazon Fire TVs come with some apps preloaded, so all you have to do is sign in and start watching. A Roku is another way you can stream to your TV."]},"id":"4b871812-32df-47e2-a949-14222af905f4","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/zhnRzikuo5Uw99PxbxAc79.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"<strong>Commercials</strong>","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/streaming-sites-testing-2/w/711/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9YLzMvNzkwNDU1L29yaWdpbmFsL01vdmllLWFuZC1UVi1TdHJlYW1pbmctU2VydmljZXMtVGVzdGluZy0wMDEuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zhnRzikuo5Uw99PxbxAc79.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"zhnRzikuo5Uw99PxbxAc79","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zhnRzikuo5Uw99PxbxAc79.jpg","alt":""},"id":"f6b43aec-ca12-4027-8040-867c23794dea","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Cord-cutters looking to escape commercials are slowly having fewer and fewer cheap options. Netflix, for example, added commercials to some content in 2018 to test viewer response. Hulu, on the other hand, plans to nearly eliminate commercials but only for those who buy the most expensive membership package. Hulu also started using interactive advertisements. For example, we saw one for Amazon Alexa that requires you to click on items around the image of a living room to see what the voice assistant can do, like turn on lights or turn up the music. If you opt for the free version of YouTube, not YouTube Premium, you’ll notice you can skip forward past some advertisements once they’ve played for a certain amount of time. This is nice, but if you’re trying to escape ads all together, you need a Premium subscription. Ads are also consistently becoming more targeted and customized to you based on your online footprint, so don’t be shocked if you notice a lot of ads for sneakers while your friends see ads for cars."]},"id":"e241b4d7-1726-481f-bba4-3531d6a546a2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_122","url":"/best-internet-tv-sites","authors":[{"email":"anna.burleson@futurenet.com","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-23T21:15:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-23T21:15:00Z","name":"Best Movie and TV Streaming Sites of 2019","synopsis":"Here's a side-by-side comparison of popular streaming sites and services.
