The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-espresso-machines\">Espresso Machines</a> here.</em>","One of the best features of the Hamilton Beach 40715 espresso maker is the removable water reservoir. The reservoir is clear and mounts to the back of the espresso machine so you can easily monitor the water level. It is big enough to hold a lot of water, so you don&#39;t have to refill the tank each time you want to make espresso.","As with all the products on our espresso machine review, the Hamilton 40715 has a steam wand. However, because it is adjustable you can steam, froth, churn and blend milk to top your espresso or turn it into a cappuccino or latte. The cup warmer lets you heat up your coffee cup while you wait for the cappuccino maker to get ready for brewing.","A combination measuring and tamping tool is included. You will be able to measure the precise amount of coffee grounds needed for your espresso machine and then tamp them to prepare the type of espresso you enjoy.","The Hamilton Beach 40715 is capable of brewing up to four ounces, or shots, of espresso at a time. With a push of a button and a turn of the dial, you can manually set the machine to brew two cups at once. Because this cappuccino maker stands more than 15 inches high, it has the clearance to hold a taller mug if you want to enjoy the entire four ounces of espresso yourself.","Both coffee grounds and espresso pods can be used with this machine. The portafilter comes with two filter holders depending on whether you use grounds or pods. The manual controls allow you to set the temperature and toggle between brewing and steaming modes. Unfortunately, you cannot control the brew strength. If the espresso is too strong, you can add water afterwards to tone it down.","The indicator light will help you know when the machine is ready to make a great-tasting latte. It will also serve as a warning to curious little hands that the espresso machine may be hot. This espresso machine has a polarized plug, so it can only be plugged into an electrical socket one way.","Hamilton Beach offers every support option imaginable. You can access online user guides and read FAQs on the Hamilton Beach website. Telephone and email support is available 24/7. You can even connect with Hamilton Beach and its courteous support staff on Facebook. We are impressed with how quickly Hamilton Beach responded to our emails, which was usually within a couple hours."]},"id":"e2fa81cc-d18f-4542-8a2a-975f08d14665","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"04e3b1ad-ed9f-46a2-98c1-f6db8059b15c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Quality espresso is made with machines like the Hamilton Beach 40714 that use bar pump pressure during the brewing process.
