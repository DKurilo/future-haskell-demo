Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Your computer needs regular maintenance to work its best and provide you with the most enjoyable computing experience. MAGIX PC Check &amp; Tuning provides the tools and features you need to maintain your computer. This <a href=\"/best-pc-system-utilities-software\">PC system utilities</a> application not only offers many of the tools you will find in similar applications, but also advanced features that provide excellent results. Overall, we are very impressed with this application and all that it offers to both beginning and advanced users. However, we did see a few minor drawbacks to this application as well.","This PC system utilities application provides all of the basic tools you will see in many similar applications. This software takes a close look at all aspects of your computer and provides you with detailed information about your PC. In addition, a results page displays the issues found on your PC and gives you the option to fix them immediately.","Cleaning and maintaining your registry can be risky and scary, but MAGIX PC Check &amp; Tuning assists you through the process. This software provides cleaning tools that scan the registry for any errors and then walks you through the process of fixing the issues and improving your computer’s performance. In addition, this utilities application allows you to defrag your registry and makes it possible for you to remove all of those empty registry entries that are slowing down your computer.","One of the standout features available on PC Check &amp; Tuning is its PC Live tool. This feature will continuously monitor your computer system and look for any errors that may be slowing down your PC’s performance. This tool runs silently in the background, so you won’t have constant pop-ups and annoying screens appear and disrupt your workflow. The only time you will be notified is when the software finds an issue that needs your attention.","Another highlight of this PC system utility is its startup controls. Using an improved startup analysis, you can see which applications are needed during startup and which ones are slowing down your boot-up time. We were pleased to see that if you are a beginner, you can let PC Check &amp; Tuning decide which settings are needed. You also have the option to choose them yourself.","Unfortunately, there are a few features and tools that this application does not offer. It does not provide hard drive failure protection, which is a drawback. This feature keeps you aware of the health status of your hard drive and notifies you of impending failure to ensure that you have your data properly saved. Also, there are no specific options for controlling file and folder settings. This would allow you to see detailed information regarding specific folders and files on your computer, which is an excellent tool, particularly for more advanced users.","MAGIX PC Check &amp; Tuning truly excels with all of the repair and recovery tools. This application has internet-tuning tools that optimize your internet settings and helps your internet run much faster. The software will also delete your internet history so you don’t have to worry about cookies or internet files becoming an issue with your privacy.","This application cleans your hard drive and offers repair tools. However, there are no shortcut repair capabilities, which we were disappointed to see. There are full system backup options and tools to rescue previously deleted files. There is also a file shredder available on this application to ensure that any files you do not want to be recovered, which may contain personal and private information, are wiped away completely.","This PC system utilities application is very easy to use and navigate. All of the features and tools are displayed in user-friendly menus. Many processes that could be difficult are simplified with step-by-step guidance. Explanations of each feature are provided within the application so that you have some idea about what the tools are designed to accomplish.","MAGIX provides adequate support if you have any issues with this application. A small knowledgebase is provided on the MAGIX website that offers some assistance. If you would prefer to talk directly to a technical support representative, both telephone and email support is available."]},"id":"57f7ef42-3cee-4675-b062-c4a049ccc4a6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d68e2891-ccbb-4edd-a835-692592e85eaa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["MAGIX PC Check &amp; Tuning is an excellent choice for a PC system utilities application.
