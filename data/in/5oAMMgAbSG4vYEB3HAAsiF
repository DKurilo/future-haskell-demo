This means its security is only as good as your deadbolt&#39;s.","Despite variable hardware security, Danalock&#39;s software uses heavy encryption to protect against hackers. The lock sends audio and mobile alerts when it jams and is unable to lock. However, it doesn&#39;t have a siren and can&#39;t detect forced entry attempts.
