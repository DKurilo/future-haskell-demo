The sound quality is superb and there was very little static, as long as we stayed close to the transmitter. The actual range of this model is probably about 30 feet; if you venture much farther than that the static and echoes can become extremely annoying.","We also noticed that despite an advertized, patented bass sound system, the bass on this device was not as rich as corded earphones.

The wireless headphones use a radio frequency to transmit the sound. The range is better than similar Bluetooth and infrared devices. The advertized range is about 300 feet. However, we found that the wireless headphones stop working effectively after about 30 feet. The sound quality decreased dramatically as we wandered farther from the transmitter.","The LTB Q-HOME-FX Wireless True 5.1 model has three separate speakers, one for the front audio and the subwoofer, one for the center audio and the last for the rear sound. The manufacturer advertizes a patented SafeBass Sub Resonance technology. However, these are not the best wireless headphones for quality bass.","These wireless headphones use rechargeable batteries. The batteries will recharge as you leave them on the transmitter. The wireless headphones also have several audio controls on the sides, as well as a power switch.","The products have an adjustable earloop that is somewhat comfortable. However, the quality of the plastic is somewhat poor, and we have read a lot of reports that say the headbands break frequently. This can be especially problematic when purchasing the devices online, because it makes exchanges and returns extra difficult."]},"id":"bca7d2fc-c2a7-4766-8430-3810795ca513","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Accessories"},"id":"c5d2630a-f721-4979-9000-25462189dc32","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The wireless headphones are sleek and so is the shiny black transmitter.
