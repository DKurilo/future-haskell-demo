The DMCA makes no exceptions for circumventing these encryptions for personal use.

You can add menus, create clips, and customize the audio and subtitles with this software. However, unlike with the best Blu-ray burning software, you cannot decrypt copyrighted content, so this is not the software for backing up your Blu-ray movie collection.","Aiseesoft Blu-ray Creator is easy to install, doesn&#39;t come with any extra programs and doesn&#39;t try to install freeware. Some of the lower-ranked products we reviewed try to get you to install more than you want or need. Once you have the program open, the interface is easy to use. The buttons are large, and they include images and text descriptions of the tasks they perform. The program offers a quick guide for getting started. You can upload files, merge them and perform basic editing to produce the disc you want. You can also crop the video, adjust the hue and contrast, and add a watermark. Before you burn the disc, you can preview these changes.","If you want to back up your collection of Blu-ray discs, you will have to use a separate program. This software is not designed to copy content, so you need to have the files ready before you work on them. Aiseesoft Blu-ray Creator cannot decrypt commercial discs or remove region codes. This is exclusively Blu-ray burner software for your personal content and uses an internal or external Blu-ray burner. Therefore, you can&#39;t burn DVDs or CDs with this software. You can save your AVCHD files as ISO image files, though. You can burn a copy of an AVCHD or ISO file straight to a Blu-ray disc or your hard drive.","Should you run into any problems using the software, Aiseesoft provides an email address for you to contact its support representatives. You can also contact the company through Twitter and Facebook. There are a few helpful articles online as well. Many Aiseesoft programs have individual FAQs pages and guides, but the company doesn&#39;t currently offer those options for the Blu-ray Creator. You can find a short step-by-step tutorial on the product page, but that&#39;s about it for help."]},"id":"ec30f477-0dc0-4527-bbfd-9adff913ed95","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c1aff4ab-96ab-4890-a659-50d0ef0e9d3a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As Blu-ray writer software, this program does a good job.
