Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The<strong> </strong>EasyShare Sport by Kodak isn&#39;t one of the <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">best waterproof digital cameras</a>, but it will certainly get the job done. This small and lightweight underwater camera has a 12MP resolution, quick photo-sharing feature and one-year warranty. Because of its durability, small size and fun design, we recommend purchasing this waterproof camera for a child or teenager. They could take it swimming with friends and family, and since the camera is waterproof, it is protected from spills and rain.","With 12 megapixels, this camera has a lower resolution than most modern digital cameras. Its pictures do not turn out as well as the photographs from our top waterproof camera picks. However, the photos you take with the EasyShare Sport are still detailed and sharp. You can use the underwater white balance to give beneath-the-surface photos a more clear and vivid appearance.","The EasyShare Sport has Kodak’s EasyShare feature, which lets you take photos and tag the ones you want to upload immediately. Once you connect the digital camera to a computer, the photos and videos you’ve tagged will automatically upload to your sites such as Facebook, YouTube, Flickr and more. You can also automatically send them to your Kodak Pulse digital picture frame.","The EasyShare Sport is a fun yet modern-looking camera that comes in three different colors. It is very small and compact, which makes it perfect for travel. It is waterproof, but it you take it in water deeper than 10 feet, the water pressure could cause the camera to leak and break. It is also dustproof, but Kodak makes no mention of the camera being freezeproof or shockproof.","This underwater camera has a 32MB internal memory. We were very disappointed to learn that the EasyShare Sport does not use a rechargeable Li-ion battery. It can only receive power from two AA batteries. AA batteries last a few hours, but you will always need to change them after they run dry, which means you may have to buy or take extra batteries with you while you are on vacation. Another solution would be to use rechargeable AA batteries.","The waterproof camera comes in a box that also includes two AA batteries, a wrist strap, a USB connecting cable and a user guide.","Kodak covers this waterproof camera with a one-year warranty. If it breaks or malfunctions due to water damage, you can send it in. However, if you were using it in water deeper than 10 feet, Kodak may not replace or fix your product.","You can find the user manual and FAQs for this waterproof digital camera on Kodak’s website. If you have specific questions about the EasyShare Sport, you can also contact Kodak directly through live chat, telephone and email."]},"id":"eeb78ab9-710b-4d58-b43f-79c217737553","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2c5c4972-89be-4dec-a7de-050e4c1ea36b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Older kids and teenagers will appreciate the photo sharing feature and waterproof durability of the EasyShare Sport by Kodak.
