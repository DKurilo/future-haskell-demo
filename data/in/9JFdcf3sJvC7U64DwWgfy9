You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Pet owners everywhere are always eager to keep their carpeting and hardwood floors free of pet hair. This Bissell model is designed especially for that type of cleaning as well as general vacuuming.","Assembling this <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">upright vacuum</a> took us five minutes, and it was not particularly easy. We needed to consult the manual to find out how to attach the optional expandable hose, and the entire assembly was not intuitive. This vacuum comes with a pet hair tool, a crevice cleaning tool and an extended reach hose to help when cleaning high places or stairs.","Once this upright bagless vacuum cleaner is ready to go, it performs well overall on both carpet and hard floor. This vacuum did just fine with flour spilled on medium-pile carpeting. It struggled to remove flour from low-pile carpeting and hardwood flooring, though. With the brush roll turned off, it appeared as if there was no suction power being applied to the flour mess. It also needed a few more passes than we like to clear kitty litter off all our test surfaces.","This vacuum is easy to move around any type of flooring. It glides smoothly and its swiveling head helps it move around furniture. This upright bagless vacuum does not lie completely flat, but it reclines enough that you can reach under certain kinds of furniture.","At 16.3 pounds, it is a little above average but didn&#39;t seem noticeably heavy. This is a bit noisy with a measured high decibel level of 92 dB. If you like to vacuum at odd times this could be a problem for those with whom you share walls.","One drawback is this PowerGlide has a relatively small cleaning path that is 12.5 inches wide. However, Bissell advertises that this vacuum offers &#34;edge-to-edge&#34; suction power within the entire width of that base, unlike lesser-quality vacuums that have suction power only in one area. You also can press a button on the top of the vacuum to switch easily from carpeting to hard floors.","This vacuum does not have genuine HEPA filtration, but it has its own filtration system. You also get washable filters and an optional Febreze-infused filter to remove any unpleasant smells from a room while you are cleaning.","The canister is easy to remove since you simply push a button and then use an up-and-out lifting motion to detach the canister from the body of the vacuum. It is easy to empty the dirt canister into the trash with another push of a button."]},"id":"ac3d677f-a9f3-4ebe-ac99-e070ec55d38e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5504f067-f0b4-4929-95ee-a1710c3a9797","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bissell PowerGlide Pet Vacuum offers a number of appealing features, including good suction for most kinds of flooring and the easy-to-use swiveling head.
