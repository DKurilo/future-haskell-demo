You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","GE GLD7460RSS is another of the GE tall tub <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-dishwashers/\">dishwashers</a>. This model doesn’t have a concealed heating element or hidden controls, but it has features like SmartDispense technology and 5-stage filtration that will knock your socks off. This dishwasher also has a fabulous warranty with some parts protected by a lifetime warranty.","Feel free to call your friends over and have a party without worrying about clean up. The GE GLD7460RSS dishwasher’s tall tub capacity can fit up to 16, 5-piece dish sets with ease. Don’t even worry about scraping off caked on food; this dishwasher is equipped with a hard food disposer that grinds up excess food and rinses it down the drain. Best of all, once you’ve stacked all of the dishes in and they begin washing at any of the six wash cycles available, you and your friends can easily chat while the dishwasher cleans away. At a quiet 54dB, you may not even notice that the dishwasher is running over your conversation. A little over an hour later, the heated dry option will kick in, sanitizing your dishes while making sure they dry spot free. This dishwasher is also Energy Star qualified and will cost you an estimated $35 per year to operate.","The GE GLD7460RSS dishwasher truly is a smart appliance. Not only does it have an optimum wash sensor that saves water by stopping the wash cycle when it knows the dishes are clean, but it also has SmartDispense technology that dispenses detergent only when you need it. The dishwasher actually holds 40oz of detergent and you don’t need to worry about refilling until it tells you to. If you prefer to have your dishwasher run at night, simply set its delay start timer, 1-9 hours to the time you would like it to start. We only see one major missing feature in the GE GLD7460RSS dishwasher – a concealed heating element. Unlike its competition, this dishwasher’s heating coil at the bottom of the tub is not hidden. It also doesn’t have a stainless steel interior.","This dishwasher isn’t the sleekest looking on the market. It is available in stainless steel, but it also has a black trim on the bottom and the top. The controls are visible on the top section of the black trim. Dimension-wise, the GE GLD7460RSS is like any other standard dishwasher. It can easily fit under the counter and GE offers this model in four different colors: white, black, stainless steel and bisque (beige).","GE’s warranty covers the owner quite well. Not only does it come with the standard one-year parts and labor, but it also covers the racks and electronics with a five-year warranty. Additionally, the tub and door liner are protected under a lifetime warranty. Other brands would do well to treat their customers the same."]},"id":"2e20099e-c8ef-4303-a99f-70a0a719444f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d3b10fe1-1f39-4602-8308-4b251e19d0cc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We have a love-hate relationship with the GE GLD7460RSS dishwasher.
