The Sharp and Hisense TVs in our comparison have many things in common, including a 60Hz refresh rate, full array LED backlighting and the same user interface. One of the main differences we found is that the Sharp AQUOS N7000U features HDR capabilities, which gives the Sharp more vivid and brighter picture quality than a few of the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">4K TVs</a> toward the bottom of our lineup.","One of the first things we noticed as we compared the 4K LED TVs to one another is that the Sharp AQUOS TV does not have good off-center viewing. The sharper the angle you take, the more the screen begins to wash out. This makes the TV look too bright and gray as the picture fades.","Another thing we noticed is the LED backlighting does not allow this set to achieve an absolute black screen â€“ far from it. The edge lighting on the Sharp isn&#39;t great, leaving all four corners lit up as we watched. Even the black bars you see above and below the picture when you watch a movie appeared more gray that black.","When we streamed a 4K musical performance from Emi Myers, we noticed that the TV couldn&#39;t refresh fast enough to keep the screen picture from jittering. The 60Hz refresh rate is the slowest we&#39;ve seen in an HDR TV. On the other hand, the Sharp&#39;s color saturation and accuracy looked good considering the problems it had with contrast and refresh rate.","Further testing with Calman software, a pattern generator and image sensor confirmed what he had noticed with this 4K TV&#39;s ability to accurately depict color. Our data shows this TV accurately reproduces colors but doesn&#39;t nearly have the contrast ratio that other 4K TV sets display. In terms of color accuracy, this falls in the middle of the pack, but toward the bottom half for contrast ratio.","The remote control is big and clunky. It looks like a remote for an AV receiver that has many buttons you will never touch. Unlike other remotes from other LED TVs we reviewed, it doesn&#39;t have any special features such as gesture control or voice commands to help navigate through the menu.","The Smart Central interface is easy enough to navigate. It doesn&#39;t look as nice as some of the other smart interfaces, but the 23 streaming apps are laid out horizontally and are easy to scroll through. The web browser is not much of a delight to use. You have to control the cursor with the arrow buttons on the remote. The cursor is not smooth so it takes a decent amount of time to type anything using the on-screen keyboard and cursor.","If you are looking for an LED TV in a different size than the 55-inch, the Sharp AQUOS N7000U is also available in 65-, 60-, 50- and 43-inch models."]},"id":"db56ebb9-0d95-41b5-b38c-c08a6fd753e3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"94c64c39-d1a7-47ff-a6db-cd9c820bc660","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sharp AQUOS N7000U does not have the best contrast ratio in our group, but it does have good color accuracy and an easy-to-navigate interface with many streaming apps and other smart TV applications.
