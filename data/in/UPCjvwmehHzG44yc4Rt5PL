Everything you do on your computer is recorded and stored, so it’s important to remove those traces to protect your privacy. Evidence Blaster focuses on the two primary functions of most privacy software: cleaning and file shredding. Cleaning works on Windows and internet history. Of course, there may be certain elements you don’t want removed, so you can choose which cookies and URLs to keep. In the Secure Deletion tab, you can use the integrated file shredder to obliterate sensitive files. This privacy program will let you overwrite a file up to 20 times to make the evidence completely unrecoverable.","In the Advanced tab, you can choose whether to load the program on Windows startup or in the system tray. You can decide to clean when Windows shuts down or when the program starts up. And you can choose whether to run the program in stealth mode. You&#39;re also given hotkey options to hide the program, run cleaning operations, minimize all windows, log off current user and shutdown Windows. All of these functions can be activated using hotkeys. At the bottom of the Advanced tab, you can choose whether to perform a cleaning once per day or hour or after a certain number of minutes.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"572afe01-fc8e-4787-963f-7874b3c194dd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ac9f01fd-9ea3-4de4-a713-f859c6058101","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Evidence Blaster is privacy software that cleans Windows, Internet Explorer and FireFox.
