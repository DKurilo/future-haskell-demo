You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","For 2D <a href=\"/best-cad-software\">CAD software</a> that will help you create floor plans, mechanisms and more, TurboCAD LTE is a great choice. This simple program isn’t bogged down with unnecessary features and has standard features such as a command line, in-program manual and snap tools.","With this CAD program, you can add details to designs using cross hatching, transparency options, a color editor and lighting effects. This version of TurboCAD LTE also has a wall tool and house wizard for architectural designs. The software lacks some of the sophisticated features you’d find on more advanced CAD software. Photorealistic rendering, a tool that creates realistic images from your designs, and animation features are both missing.","TurboCAD LTE is a lighter version of more sophisticated CAD drawing software, but it still has most of the best features. Tool palettes are customizable so you can add and remove them as you please. A command line and the ability to import existing designs will save you time and effort. A macro recorder is missing, but a setup manager is included so you can customize the format of your design before you start working.","The biggest shortcoming of TurboCAD LTE is that it does not offer a lot in the way of 3D functionality. However, if you are interested in only creating 2D designs, it’s hard to beat this 2D CAD software. With ample 2D functionality and compatibility, this software provides excellent value for consumers and hobbyists. Its repertoire of design tools and methods include line tools, snaps, arcs, circles and tools.","TurboCAD LTE is supplemented with several help and support options that ensure you can fully utilize the application. Perhaps one of the most useful options provided is the built-in user manual. Accessed directly from the software, the manual provides comprehensive instructions on how to use all the features and tools. The manual proved to be highly useful, as we referenced it multiple times while creating rudimentary designs. On the TurboCAD website, there are also training videos, a FAQs section and user forums. The software also comes with free email and telephone support for the most current versions of the software.","TurboCAD LTE supports all the major industry-standard formats, including DWG, a drawing file native to AutoCAD and many other CAD applications. Broad file compatibility means you can easily import files created using other CAD software including DXF and DWF. The software is also compatible with SKP, SketchUp files, and it supports image files such as JPEG and PNG."]},"id":"2608b27b-bf7f-460c-ad0a-a77cfb9b79f1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2a7327ed-0ce7-4618-a7fb-813ae7604f8b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While TurboCAD LTE lacks many 3D modeling features, the software offers exceptional bang for your buck with robust 2D functionality.
