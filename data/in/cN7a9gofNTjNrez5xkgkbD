It&#39;s only 0.6 inches thick and comes with a 12.5-inch screen, which is perfect if you&#39;re looking for something discrete and portable. The 1080p display produces accurate colors and emits 292 nits, according to our brightness test. It&#39;s a little below the category average of 303 nits but still perfectly acceptable for tasks like reading the day&#39;s news, online shopping or checking your email.","This little laptop comes in different configurations, but we tested one with an Intel Core m3-6Y30 processor and 4GB of RAM, which is significantly less RAM and power than other laptops we tested like the <a href=\"/hewlett-packard-review\">HP Spectre X360</a>&#39;s Intel Core i7-8550U processor with 16GB of RAM. Still, the Flip worked just fine while we had 15 browser tabs open, including one YouTube video, so it&#39;ll work for most people who just want to check their email and social media accounts. It also didn&#39;t experience any of the overheating problems some laptops have as all parts of this machine stayed below 87 degrees Fahrenheit while we streamed video, well below the 95-degree comfort threshold.","Our Flip came with 64GB of storage. That’s not much. You’ll probably want more if you want to store high-res pictures and HD movies. We tested one of the high-end configurations, but it came at a reasonable price. If you’re looking to save even more money, you can get this unit with a Pentium processor and a mere 32GB of storage. Beware though, because this severely limits the amount of data you can keep on your computer.","The hinges on this machine allow you to turn it into a tablet by flipping the screen all the way around. The tracking on the touchscreen is accurate, so kids and adults could easily use this computer to play games at home or on the go. The keyboard on the Flip we tested was fantastic and the buttonless touch pad was very accurate. The audio is by no means perfect, but we were able to fill a conference room with music when the sound was turned up all the way. The side of this slim laptop houses two USB Type-C ports, a headphone jack, microSD card reader and volume and power buttons. Of course, it also has a webcam.","The battery life is also good, giving you 8 hours and 52 minutes of use, similar to the <a href=\"/asus-zen-review\">Asus ZenBook 13</a>. This is more than enough if you want a home computer you can take to work with you without having to worry about recharging. While the battery life isn’t enough to make up for the lack of storage, the Flip will work just fine for households who want a home computer to cover the basics."]},"id":"8c285c2f-64bc-48ee-a445-7d0e1e0d5597","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69669","url":"/asus-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-10-24T16:21:49Z","datePublished":"2017-10-24T16:21:49Z","name":"ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA","synopsis":"This small machine weighs a mere 2.6 pounds, making it the lightest home computer we tested.
