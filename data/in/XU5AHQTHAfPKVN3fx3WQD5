This portable <a href=\"/best-digital-photo-frames\">digital photo frame</a> is intended to serve as a photo album, which limits its use as a stationary frame. The image quality tends to be subpar, and it has some frustrating design quirks.","This frame shines in terms of storage, offering 4GB of internal memory and a folder menu system that makes it easy to see which photo is in which album. This is also the most portable option we found during our digital photo frame reviews. It has almost six hours of battery life, so you can pass this one around at a family reunion, or anywhere else, completely cordless.","In terms of versatility, this Wi-Fi digital photo frame is also quite nice if you are picky about your slideshow. You can have the transition between photos last anywhere from five seconds to 24 hours, so you can feature your new favorite photo for a good long time.","That being said, we struggled to get this digital frame up and running. A long initial period is required to charge the battery, and it is difficult to get jump drives and SD cards in and out of the little compartment that houses all the slots. This compartment keeps the jump drive from dangling out the back of the frame but is rather frustrating. We had to use a wire tie to extract the jump drive again and again. In addition, the little plastic door is hard to open. For easier setup and operation, take a look at the <a href=\"/micca-review\">Micca NEO</a>.","When we did get the frame up and running, the picture quality was middling. No matter the source – SD cards, jump drives or the frame&#39;s own internal storage – our test photos were grainy and dull. When you aren’t looking at the pictures straight on, the quality deteriorates further.","The best electronic picture frames allow you to view high-quality images from different spots in the room. This one looks OK if you cradle it and look right at it, which makes sense, since it was designed to function as a sort of replacement for traditional photo albums. It even comes with a padded fold-over case like an old-fashioned photo album. There is a flimsy kickstand for displaying it on a desktop but no nail hook for wall display. This is just as well, since you really can&#39;t see the photo on this digital frame unless you are looking right at it anyway."]},"id":"604cf153-6055-49e2-8cfb-7ed2d3a0fea6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b5250265-2191-41bd-952b-cc1ebefca62f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The photo reproduction is of a mediocre quality, but Digital Foci&#39;s D-Light Box has strong points, to be sure.
