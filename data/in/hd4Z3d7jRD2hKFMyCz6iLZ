Perhaps your card reader is no longer functional or it&#39;s using dated security technologies. Whatever your reason, here are some &#34;must haves&#34; to consider for your next credit card machine purchase:","<strong>It Must Be Okay with your Existing Relationship<br/></strong> <em>Purchase a card terminal that is compatible with your current merchant service.</em>","Your current merchant service may not be compatible with all credit card terminals. You&#39;ll need to contact your credit card processing service and request a list of compatible terminal models. In addition, you&#39;ll want to verify the reader you have in mind is compatible with your POS system. You may even request a technician to help you set up the new card terminals correctly.","<strong>Chip in for Your Own Protection</strong><br/><em>As annoying as EMV card readers are, it&#39;s a necessity.</em>","If you don&#39;t yet own an EMV card reader, you&#39;ve likely used one. They read the new chip cards, and retailers have been required to have one for compliance since October 2015. You might as well purchase the new type of reader now and schedule your <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/business/payment-processing/best-credit-card-processing/\">EMV compliance</a> inspection, since you&#39;ll eventually have to do it anyway.","Still not sure? If a transaction is found to be fraudulent and you are deemed noncompliant, you may be liable rather than the bank or processor. Being compliant is for your own protection and most terminals also include a magnetic card reader. ","<strong>No Strings Attached</strong><br/><em>Beware of long-term relationships and binding commitments.</em>","<strong>Leasing</strong><br/>Like most business owners looking for a credit card reader, you may naturally turn to the internet to find the most affordable, durable reader. However, take our word for it: Like online dating, you may be one search away from uncovering a card-terminal-leasing nightmare.","A new EMV card reader usually costs less than $200. Let&#39;s say you need five new readers – that is $1,000 plus tax. It may seem like a lot of money, and your sales rep will most likely try to push you toward leasing because the credit card reader provider earns a lot of money through this method. Five leased terminals can quickly turn into $50 (or more) each month, often three years or more (the average contract duration is three years). That&#39;s $9,000. You can easily see why buying outright is the better option.","<strong>Automatic Renewals</strong><br/>Often hidden in the fine print is something called automatic renewals. For example, if you sign a three-year contract and don&#39;t opt out before your 36 months is up, in some cases to the exact day, you&#39;re automatically renewed often for another three years.","If you quit your contract after it has automatically renewed, you may be asked to pay for the remaining contract duration and pay outright for the terminal. Some customers are charged when they return &#34;damaged&#34; equipment within the contract&#39;s allotted cancellation period, such as with the first 30 days.","<strong>Ensure Transactions Are Consensual</strong><br/><em>Provide technologies so your customer can verify payments in their desired way.</em>","Credit card terminals with PIN pads offer a variety of options for how customers can pay for your goods and services. At a minimum, you&#39;ll want a reader with a PIN pad so customer paying by debit card can enter their PINs securely.","You may also opt for a terminal with a pad that accepts customer signatures as well. If your customers want to pay using a mobile wallet or other type of mobile phone payment method, consider upgrading to an EMV card terminal that also has near-field-communication (NFC) technology for mobile payments.","In the near future, you may also be able to add biometric technologies for reading fingerprints. If you want to support gift or loyalty cards, you&#39;ll want to purchase a reader that supports this payment option as well.","<strong>It Supports Your Wandering Ways </strong><br/><em>Many card terminals can process transactions by mobile, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB, cable or Ethernet connection.</em>","There are a variety of ways that credit card terminals connect to your POS and processing service. You&#39;ll need to find one that connects in the ways that you desire. The lowest-priced terminals are connected directly typically via a USB or cable. But that can be clunky and inconvenient. So you may want to consider a wireless option. If you roam from your store or restaurant to sell product in an open-air market or convention venue, you may want to add a mobile option as well. Many merchant services offer free mobile hardware options.","New credit card terminals are affordable and provide a variety of technologies of choose from. Once you create your list of must haves, you&#39;ll be ready to shop for your new card processing partner.
