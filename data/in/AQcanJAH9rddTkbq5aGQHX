You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","ViewSonic is known for monitors, but the vendor also has a handful of compelling PC computers, including the VPC100 All-in-One. As opposed to the traditional <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-pc,review-2159.html\">all-in-one PC</a> that is high-performance and expensive, the ViewSonic VPC100 All-in-One is relatively limited in power and speed. But with an overall cost significantly less expensive than the best all-in-one PCs, the ViewSonic all-in-one has several compelling selling points.","The ViewSonic VPC100 isn’t equipped for heavy lifting or system-intensive processes. The limited power and memory leave the system drained if you try to do too much. But for standard internet use, watching movies and basic computing, it’s a competent PC.","The space-saving design and combination of features are a good option for a supplementary home computer in the kitchen or guest room. The all-in-one PC is also a reasonable choice for specific business use – for example, in call centers or storefronts. The all-in-one computer is adequately equipped for basic tasks (word processing, spreadsheets, online video) but won’t be able to do things like video editing or serious multitasking.","The ViewSonic VPC100 All-in-One PC has the form factor of an all-in-one media center but the guts of a netbook. The CPU is an Intel Atom N270 (single core) with 1.6GHz processing speed. The 160GB hard drive and 1GB of RAM are similarly on the low end.","The most notable feature of the all-in-one PC is (as expected) the monitor. The stand-mounted LCD display has 18.5 inches of screen real estate with a 16:9 layout. ViewSonic opted to house most of the actual computer below the display (a la iMac), which keeps the monitor remarkably thin. At its thickest, the monitor is a mere 3.5 cm.","The all-in-one computer has an integrated microphone and stereo speakers. There is also a built-in 1.3 megapixel webcam. The optical drive is a tray-loading rewritable DVD drive located on the right side of the monitor. Just below it is a 4-in-1 (SD/SDHC, xD, Memory stick and MMC) card reader. The computer only has four USB ports: two on the side and two in back. The back panel also houses the headphone and microphone jacks and an Ethernet port. You can also connect to the internet with the built-in Wi-Fi (though it’s only up to 802.11b/g).","Unfortunately, the bundled keyboard and mouse are subpar. Not only are they wired, but they use old PS/2 connectors rather than USB. The mouse is standard fare, but the keyboard is inferior. It looks decent enough, with a compact design and media controls built in. However, the keys are noisy, too close together in areas, and annoying to actually use. For an all-in-one desktop that opted against a touchscreen interface, the input peripherals could certainly use some work.","ViewSonic has an online support center, but it’s pretty limited. For the ViewSonic VPC100 All-in-One PC specifically, you can find a product manual and downloadable drivers. You can also register your new computer online or purchase an extended warranty."]},"id":"a1f1513f-cb8d-424e-8a23-e489259a33e7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8276d138-2d3a-4750-b4e1-d65ec16fbb98","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Our take on the ViewSonic VPC100 All-in-One: It’s a competent nettop computer. It has the design and ambiance of an all-in-one PC but the heart of a netbook. It has a larger monitor and sleeker design than a traditional desktop but is limited in power, speed and overall performance.","You might think of the ViewSonic VPC100 as a computer with an identity crisis. It’s about the same price as a standard desktop, considerably less powerful than a true all-in-one, and not portable like a netbook. But it can also be seen as a PC with a purpose (limited though it may be). It fills a need that netbooks are too small to fill and that traditional all-in-ones are too expensive for. The ViewSonic VPC100 All-in-One computer is a budget-friendly, space-saving all-in-one PC that is great for the kitchen, spare room or modest business application."]},"id":"66af009e-4e10-49e9-8cb6-e72a25e87fd2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52214","url":"/viewsonic-all-in-one-pc-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"brian-westover","url":"/author/brian-westover","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Brian Westover","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"TBtnELo8v5XHxqU9uBG9c7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-02-17T16:32:24Z","datePublished":"2011-02-17T16:32:24Z","name":"ViewSonic VPC191 All-in-One PC","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
