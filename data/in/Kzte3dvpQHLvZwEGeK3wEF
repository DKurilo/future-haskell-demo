It is compatible with both smartphones and non-smartphones, and it will tell you audibly such essential things as what your battery level is or if the mute function is currently working.","One of the outstanding features is the device&#39;s remarkably extensive talk time that can be as long as 45 hours with up to six months of stand-by time. "]},"id":"53122ea6-82b6-4f97-ab1c-6639205707e3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Pricing"},"id":"1b11e49d-ecdf-416e-865c-ecc4854b8465","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This in-car speakerphone is compatible with Bluetooth-enabled communication devices.

You can choose to reject a call by pushing either the volume up or volume down button until you hear a tone.

With this Bluetooth car kit, you can talk for up to 45 hours and the standby time is up to six months – both exceptionally long times that exceed any other products we have seen.","The device&#39;s microphone offers echo and noise reduction so your calls will be clear and easy to comprehend. You turn it on and off manually with a button located on the right side of the device. You can turn voice prompts on or off by pushing and holding either the volume button or the call button until you hear that the instructions are on or off.","You also get a status light indicator (which is part of the call button) that shows 12 different colors and flashing or pulsing patterns. These tell you what&#39;s going on with your Motorola TX500. For example, three blue flashes show that it is powering on, while a slow red pulse indicates the battery is low.","The Motorola TX500 Bluetooth kit is small and unassuming, and it has an attractively simple design. The all-black compact device attaches to your car visor with two metal clips. There are four buttons on a panel that faces you while you are driving: mute, volume up, volume down and call. There also is an on/off switch on the right side.","This tidy little device measures 4.45 inches high, 2.36 inches wide and 0.59 inches deep. It weighs 3.10 ounces.
