Because of this, it doesn&#39;t need to rotate as often as smaller blades do, and the motor doesn&#39;t have to work as hard for the same level of output. It has serrated edges, which makes it more capable of cutting through tough meats or crusty breads. However, it can also be more difficult to sharpen once it needs it. You can adjust the thickness of the slice with the knob gauge behind the carriage area, up to 0.6 inches thick.","It weighs 13.2 pounds, making it the heaviest slicer in our lineup. It also measures 15 x 10.5 x 11 inches. It is still light enough to move around if needed, but it is heavy enough to provide stability while slicing.

The suction-cup feet stuck soundly to the countertop we worked on, which helped to keep us safe and create even food slices.

The guard helps you push the food into the slicer, and it has small spikes placed intermittently across it that make it easier to grip your food and keep it from slipping because of the spinning blade.","For added safety, the device&#39;s power switch is recessed into the side of the slicer. This reduces the likelihood of it being accidentally activated.
