UFXMarkets is also regulated by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). MiFID regulates investment services across the 30 member states of the European Economic Area (EEA). Because UFXMarkets is authorized to operate within the EEA, the company is registered with the largest regulatory bodies in Europe, including the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the United Kingdom, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) in Germany, and the Banque de France. This broker has been in business since 2007; however, it obtained most of its accreditations in the last few years. UFXMarkets is not available to traders in the United States.","This forex broker provides access to more than 45 currency pairs. New clients can open an account with as little as $100 USD. Keep in mind that even though many brokerages use USD as the standard currency, that does not necessarily mean they can take American clients. That is true for this broker as well. It is not able to take U.S. clients, but it can accept clients from most of the world. UFXMarkets offers micro, mini, standard and advanced accounts. The advanced accounts are available in Gold and Platinum levels and provide services such as fixed spreads, one-click trading, VIP dealing offers and customized reports.","UFXMarkets is a market maker broker, which does not collect commissions, but rather collects compensation via the bid/ask spread, which is often manipulated to the broker&#39;s advantage to ensure profitability. As all forex brokers do, UFXMarkets also charges rollover fees for positions held overnight. It provides Islamic accounts with no interest charges that conform to Sharia law in terms of banking activity.","The trading platforms UFXMarkets provides include MetaTrader and ParagonEx. Gold or Platinum trading accounts can use ParagonEx to directly place trades from the trading signals presented from the trading platform. Traders also have the option to download the Trade UFX mobile trading app and trade on the go using an iPhone or Android device. To provide secure trading, UFXMarkets uses an advanced SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) by VeriSign to authenticate users and protect data transfers. Firewall protection is at the server level as well as the application level.","UFXMarkets provides a wide range of customer support and education depending on the account type. The company provides telephone, email and chat support in numerous languages during all market hours. In its education center, there are video reviews, tutorials, FAQs, a glossary and personal coaching via remote assistance. UFXMarkets also provides advanced charts, trading analysis, financial calendars and market reviews."]},"id":"2c8f1046-94bb-4899-9baf-808ee49cd4ad","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0a04c749-ae4a-458d-9542-d423045ecf03","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["UFXMarkets is now regulated to accept clients in most locations outside of the United States.
