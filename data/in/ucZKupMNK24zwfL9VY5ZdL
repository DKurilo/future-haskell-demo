You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","As a <a href=\"/home/auto/best-backup-camera\">rear view camera</a>, the Peak PKC0RB has a few things going for it. It&#39;s wireless, easy to install, inexpensive and it comes with its own monitor. All of these features are great, but it&#39;s like ordering a value meal at your favorite fast food restaurant and getting the kiddy meal when you pull through to the second window. It&#39;s all the same stuff, just smaller and not quite satisfying.","Let&#39;s start with the monitor. The fact that a monitor comes in the box is outstanding. Many of the products on our side-by-side comparison chart don&#39;t include the hardware needed to make the camera serve its most basic function. However, at 2.4 inches, it&#39;s the smallest display of all the products we reviewed. Furthermore, the resolution is also the lowest, at 173 x 115 pixels. When you compare that resolution to the iPod nano, which has a 240 x 240 resolution on an even smaller screen, you start to realize how inadequate the monitor is.","The viewing angle on the Peak PKC0RB is nice and wide. At 130 degrees, it has the ability to see as wide as some of the award-winning products on our side-by-side comparison chart. The focal length of the camera is a healthy 1.2mm. Both of those statistics are on par with its most direct competition. No complaint in the camera department, but it is difficult for these numbers to carry any weight in light of the poor monitor that displays the images the camera captures.","One feature we think is great about the Peak PKC0RB is the fact that its wireless. Other rear view cameras require you to install a length of cable through your vehicle&#39;s guts. This task is not only difficult and time consuming; if you do it wrong, you risk seriously damaging the electrical system of your automobile. Peak wisely removed this obstacle and installed a wireless transmitter in both the camera and the monitor. They make the unit as plug and play as possible. This is more than we can say for some of the other products we reviewed.","The camera itself is also easy to install. It screws right into the back bumper of your automobile. You&#39;ll have to take off your license plate and attach the camera through the same screw holes it uses. However, that isn&#39;t too big of a chore, unless your license plate screws have rusted in. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;ll need a good socket wrench to pry them loose. Overall, it should take you no more than five minutes to install the camera on your car.","If you have a problem with the Peak PKC0RB, you only have one course of action to get help. Call the company&#39;s phone support. Peak doesn&#39;t offer online resources for technical assistance, although there is an online owner&#39;s manual that you can download."]},"id":"0b18687d-3635-4bcb-8011-1c6490c384da","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f78db51d-c59d-4c2c-9199-ac06bc95ac0c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When all is said and done, the <strong>Peak PKC0RB</strong> has all the right parts of an outstanding rear view camera.
