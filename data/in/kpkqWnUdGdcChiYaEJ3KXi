The original review is below, but check out our current </em><a href=\"/best-online-tax-software\"><em>Online Tax Software  Reviews</em></a><em> here.</em>","<em>Editor&#39;s Note: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reports that the latest tax forms for the 2015 tax season will be released January 19, 2016. Online tax software services will not have access to those forms until the release date. While you may be able to prepare your return in advance, you cannot e-file until the forms are released and the IRS is accepting returns. While we have performed our preliminary tests, we cannot fully test the services and rank the products until all services are available for testing. We will update our reviews through the tax season as the newest versions are released.</em>","This   is the first year E-file.com has been included in our online tax software reviews. This service provides low-price federal and state electronic filing. It will e-file 1040EZ returns free-of-charge, and it provides the forms required to claim small business and 1099 income if needed. State e-filing is only $19 for all versions. If you do not have access to a credit card, you can pay for the service using a portion of your refund.","We tested the tax preparation service using our test return data and found the software a bit difficult to use. If you do not know exactly what information to include, you may become confused using this service to create your return. Each section includes related help information, but some sections were still puzzling. For example, when entering state income information we saw a box labeled &#34;flow to state.&#34; That is not a phrase you normally see related to consumer tax software. It also asks you your tax filing status  rather than helping you determine the most beneficial tax filing status.","The format of this software isn&#39;t intuitive, which can slow you down and even lead to inaccuracies. Instead of guiding you through an interview and asking about life events that affect your return, the software includes blue in-text hyperlinks that take you to different sections. For example, in the credits section, you have to know what blue hypertext to click on to find the section to enter your dependent care information. Once you&#39;re on that page, you can enter information about your childcare expenses. However, if you didn&#39;t know to click the text hyperlinks, you may miss a deduction altogether.","Many online e-file services – including this one – cannot actually offer tax advice. However, most will post tax-related articles and information to help you file the most accurate return as possible. But E-file.com offers little tax assistance and, unlike most tax preparation services, does not provide telephone support. After you file your return, you have to contact the IRS with any issues you may have. To acquire assistance from this service, you will have to submit an email inquiry."]},"id":"4f940b3b-94a4-488f-bfc9-f30d25e9e138","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cfa6b3fb-7b78-4036-b10a-c7779d2f0770","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is a relatively new online e-filing service and may still have a few kinks to work out before it can become a top competitor.
