The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/home/vacuum-carpet-cleaning/best-budget-vacuums/\">Budget Vacuums</a> here.</em>","The Dirt Devil Dash Upright is a budget vacuum cleaner that is designed to clean various types of carpets. It can move almost seamlessly from carpets to bare floors, stairs and other surfaces.","The assembled dimensions of the Dash are 12.8 inches wide, 12.8 inches deep and 43.8 inches high. This vacuum is constructed of heavy plastic and some metal parts. Weighing just over 15 pounds, it is still reasonably lightweight for an upright vacuum cleaner.","With a 25-foot power cord and a hose length of 8 feet (and a 12-foot extended reach), you will be able to clean a large area without having to unplug it and move it.","The easy-to-grip handle on this model doubles as a wand for attachments, and it is released by a single latch at the top of the machine. You won&#39;t need to bend down to switch modes. It&#39;s easy to go from using the Dash as an upright vacuum to using the turbo tool on upholstery or stairs. You can also easily switch to using the bare floor tool on linoleum, hardwood flooring, ceiling fans or other surfaces that accumulate dust. The microfiber Swipes pad doubles as a duster to gather loose debris as you vacuum. It is re-usable and washable â€“ so when it gets dirty, you can just throw it in the washing machine. The Dash comes with an on-board 2-in-1 Dusting and Crevice Tool and an Air powered Hand Tool.","The floor brush nozzle has four height adjustments, so it can be used effectively on a variety of carpets. The cleaning path is 12.5 inches wide.","This filter on this model is made of HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) media, so it filters 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns in size or larger. HEPA filters help trap fine particles such as pollen. This is especially helpful if you have allergies or asthma.","Dirt Devil backs this vacuum with a three-year warranty.","The Dash is extremely versatile with exceptional reach and useful tools for carpeted stairs and bare floors. It is lightweight and relatively small for an upright machine, making it easy to use and easy to store once your cleaning is done."]},"id":"6169ce0e-499f-42d5-9806-ab1a62c0658d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59983","url":"/dirt-devil-dash-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-14T22:57:49Z","datePublished":"2014-07-14T22:57:49Z","name":"Dirt Devil Dash","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
