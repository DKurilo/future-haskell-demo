All you have to do is insert the disc you want to copy into the optical drive, select what you want to copy and click the Start button. When the application is done ripping the DVD, all you have to do is insert a blank DVD and the burning process begins. Once that is complete, the application pops out the newly created movie DVD. Anyone, regardless of computer skill, can use this software.","ImTOO lets you choose which elements you want to copy, and it makes this process simple. There are three options on the main menu: Full Copy, Main Movie and Customize. Full Copy is a straight duplication of all the content found on the original DVD. Main Movie selects the longest video file found on the disc and leaves out things like special features and menus. Customize lets you pick specific files to copy. This is especially useful if you want to keep some bonus features but not all of them. All of these options require little technical knowledge to operate, but anyone who&#39;s used a Mac before should be able to use the software with no problems.","The quality of the copied content depends on the type of recordable DVD you have available. Nearly all commercial DVDs are on DVD-9 discs, meaning they hold 9GB of information. However, the majority of blank discs only hold about 5GB. ImTOO understands this and has included a convenient button labeled Auto-Fit to Disc. When you select this option, the application automatically compresses the movie to fit onto whatever blank disc you happen to have at your disposal. Just know, though, that if you use this option, you&#39;ll notice some quality loss in the video on the new disc.","One of the things that kept this software out of the top tier of our review was how long it takes to complete copy process. In our tests, it took ImTOO DVD Copy 2 for Mac nearly 1.5 hours to create a new, uncompressed copy. By contrast, the best software applications can perform the same task in under an hour."]},"id":"61ee3399-8fcd-47a9-8257-138fabb7dd87","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f3ee4666-963e-4e07-bc3a-23d992517f14","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ImTOO DVD Copy for Mac delivers on its most basic promise: copying DVDs.
