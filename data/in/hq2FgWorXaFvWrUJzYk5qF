This modern <a href=\"/best-solar-lights\">solar light</a>, designed by prominent European designer Alfredo Haberli, artistically enhances the space around your house. These lights come in three colors and two sizes to facilitate all types of yards and landscapes. The modern look is also well suited for areas around an office building.","These lights implement state-of-the-art solar technology. The eight LEDs in the Sky Plan implement photovoltaic-cell technology, producing a direct current of electricity from sunlight during the day. This powers the lights directly as it naturally recharges the batteries, providing a continuous flow of energy to last through the night.","These solar lights come in two sizes: The small lights are 7.87 inches wide by 11 inches tall, and the other lights are much taller at 7.87 inches wide by 27.5 inches tall. The small lights are great for garden areas, pathways, parking areas and pools, while the taller lights will provide a striking visual effect to a deck or a courtyard. Both sizes are made up of eight 120-volt LEDs. The size and color you decide on obviously depends on your type of yard and the effect you are going for.","This outdoor solar light is available in white, aluminum or chestnut brown. Solar lights are often limited when it comes to choices, so having a variety of colors and sizes is nice so you can customize them to your yard. These lights are weather-resistant and constructed of sturdy polycarbonate and aluminum. They can operate for a long period of time without the need for maintenance or replacement. However, they are out of the price range of most consumers. Given the price, the one-year warranty seems inadequate. Most solar lights, such as the <a href=\"/sunforce-review\">Sunforce 81256</a>, are much more affordable."]},"id":"b397b017-818e-4aa5-9738-f9a18770ac21","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"080c65ba-92e3-4e5e-9189-3048961bd8d0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sky Path Light solar landscaping lighting comes in two heights and three different colors so you can find the perfect fit for your yard.
