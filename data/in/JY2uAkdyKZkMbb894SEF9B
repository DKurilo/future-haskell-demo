With almost 20 models to choose from, it’s likely you’ll find one that fits both your kitchen and your personal needs. They are generally more expensive than other dishwashers we reviewed, but they’re well worth the price given their high capacities, powerful cleaning cycles, energy efficiency and quiet running.","The best KitchenAid <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-dishwashers/\">dishwashers</a> allow you to wash up to 16 full place settings in a single load. For an average-size family, this is enough space for a full day’s worth of dishes with some room to spare, so you don’t have to worry about running the dishwasher multiple times a day or even after every meal. KitchenAid dishwashers at the lower end of the line can hold as few as 14 place settings, which is still more than many other top-rated models by other brands we reviewed.","Many KitchenAid dishwashers feature the ProScrub option, which uses 40 targeted spray jets to cut through tough messes like cooked-on food on pots and pans. This eliminates the need to soak or prewash the dishes you use to prepare your meals. Most KitchenAid dishwashers also have ProWash, which determines the best wash cycle for an individual load of dishes based on its soil level. It also adjusts itself during the wash to make sure all your dishes are cleaned with maximum efficiency.","Washing dishes is only half of what KitchenAid dishwashers do. These machines also dry and sanitize dishes once the food has been removed. The Sani-rinse option heats the dishwater up to 145 degrees during the rinse cycle to kill all remaining germs. Couple that with KitchenAid’s ProDry system, which uses the dishwasher’s recessed heating element and fan to evaporate the remaining water, and you get clean, dry, sanitary dishes after every single wash.","KitchenAid dishwashers are some of the quietest machines you can buy – during the wash cycle, they make between 39 to 44 decibels of noise, depending on the model. This is far quieter than the other dishwashers we evaluated.","Since KitchenAid dishwashers are some of the best you can buy, it’s somewhat expected that they come with a premium price tag. The most expensive model costs more than $2,000, while the cheapest comes in at just under $850. Even at the low end, they’re more expensive than the majority of dishwashers available from other manufacturers.","Powerful cleaning tools, high load capacities and quiet running make KitchenAid dishwashers an excellent choice. However, a first-class machine comes with an expensive price tag. If it’s in your budget to get one, it will be worth every dollar you spend."]},"id":"02869faf-0a1c-4a32-8afc-707e0c418752","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58707","url":"/kitchenaid-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-28T21:17:06Z","datePublished":"2014-01-28T21:17:06Z","name":"KitchenAid Dishwashers","synopsis":"KitchenAid has many good dishwashers that can help keep you dirty dishes clean.","review":{"rating":30,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"KitchenAid has many good dishwashers that can help keep you dirty dishes clean.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-06-02T00:00:00Z","id":"JY2uAkdyKZkMbb894SEF9B","meta":{"title":"KitchenAid Dishwasher Buying Guide: An Overview to Read Before You Buy","description":"Here is an overview of KitchenAid dishwashers.
