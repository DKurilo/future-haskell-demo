Since this is a large program, you will need more than 1GB of available RAM to run it smoothly. If you&#39;d prefer a more mobile option and are willing to pay a subscription fee, this software is also available as an app for iPad. One recommendation we have for anyone taking their comic book creation seriously is to purchase a compatible graphics pen and tablet, as well as a drawing glove, to get the most out of your drawing experience.","You can find tutorials and a FAQs page on the CELSYS website, or you can email a customer representative, but there is no live chat or phone support. Clip Studio Paint&#39;s forum is active so you can also find answers from fellow users. There are plenty of Clip Studio Paint users out there, so you can also find plenty of user-created tutorials on YouTube.","Clip Studio Paint Pro is the perfect program for artists on a budget since it doesn&#39;t cost very much but still provides plenty of vector and brush tools for you to create professional-looking comics. This program isn&#39;t the easiest to learn, but with some dedicated practice and time spent learning from tutorials, inexperienced users can become proficient. This program comes with plenty of predesigned graphics to make the creation process easy. Compared to EX, one of the biggest things it lacks is the ability to arrange and work on multiple comic book pages at once. However, this software is the best choice for most amateur comic book creators."]},"id":"44eba5ba-d0b4-4d50-bcb1-ff79ea7af93b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69882","url":"/clip-studio-paint-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-04-23T21:39:42Z","datePublished":"2018-04-23T21:39:42Z","name":"Clip Studio Paint Pro 1.3","synopsis":"Clip Studio Paint Pro, aka Manga Studio, is the less expensive version of Clip Studio Paint EX.
