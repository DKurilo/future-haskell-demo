While most of the companies on our lineup loan you the medical alert equipment and require you to pay a monthly monitoring fee, ATS lets you buy the equipment outright.","With ATS, your device is not automatically linked to a monitoring station. Instead, you connect the base unit to a landline and set your own emergency contacts, such as friends or relatives. In the event of an emergency where you are unable to call for help, the <a href=\"/best-fall-detection-sensors\">fall detection</a> pendant sends an alert to the base unit, which automatically dials your contacts and alerts them of the emergency.","The wearable fall detector can be worn around your neck or on your wrist. The range of the pendant is the highest of all the pendants we tested with a 700-foot maximum and a range of 250 feet indoors. The base station batteries lasted for about 18 hours. While this is the lowest of the systems we tested, ATS is the only company that allows you to place batteries in your base unit as an extra backup.","While this service has the highest upfront cost, there are no additional fees associated with this device unless you choose to add-on monitoring services, which is an add-on option. Equipment delivery is free, and there are no activation or cancelation fees to worry about.","The help and support provided through ATS is above average with a score of 80 percent. While inquiries via email were usually answered in a timely manner, our reviewers had difficulty contacting the company over the phone and made multiple attempts before being connected to a service representative.","The fall alert system with ATS also provides premium features, which you can choose to add on to your <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-systems\">medical alert system</a>. These include a mobile a GPS option and a lockbox. ATS has a customizable base unit, which can be programmed with different features such as pill alarms; you can even turn automatic fall detection off in you choose to."]},"id":"dff1f896-ccba-4687-9f3a-c757f64fb966","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"99e1692a-2796-410b-9f45-9e1171312e4f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ATS offers a unique fall detection technology that does not require you to sign up with a monitoring station.
