Most stereos have preset filters, but not many let you customize the EQ bands. You use the touchscreen to move the frequency bands up or down, which emphasizes or deemphasizes specific frequency ranges.

In addition to letting you customize the EQ bands, the screen makes it exceptionally easy to navigate the stereo’s myriad features.  <br />\n <br />\nThe stereo’s time alignment feature helps you further improve how your audio system sounds. You place a microphone (included) where you want the best sound, such as the driver's seat or the middle console. The stereo then adjusts the timing of the audio signals so the frequencies from each speaker reach that point at the same time.

In the decades since, I have spent hundreds of hours in recording studios training my ear, studying frequency charts and learning the physics of creating great audio. My bands have recorded five albums in professional studios, and I&#39;ve personally recorded an additional six albums on my own.

The car, a 1987 Honda Civic CRX, cost me $1,200 and had over 250,000 miles, but I bought it primarily for the sound system. It featured a high-end amplifier, an 18-inch subwoofer with a custom box and top-of-the-line speakers. The way I see it, I bought a mobile sound system, not a car.

But if you&#39;re fine with a display that simply changes color and has outdated digital text, then you&#39;ll do fine with an affordable stereo."]},"id":"fcd3c39f-917c-491b-85b9-4f75ec8eb7e6","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/3DPryyHt9uBkhkKks54Syn.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/car-audio-systems/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9FL0YvNzU3MzgzL29yaWdpbmFsL0Nhci1BdWRpby1UZXN0aW5nLTAwMS5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3DPryyHt9uBkhkKks54Syn.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"3DPryyHt9uBkhkKks54Syn","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3DPryyHt9uBkhkKks54Syn.jpg","alt":""},"id":"0a6a762f-6904-4ccf-88c8-48a9609367fe","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Car Audio Systems: What to Consider Before You Buy</strong>","Every car has different acoustic challenges. Things like the ceiling shape, seat material, dash material, engine sounds and carpet density can affect the overall quality of your music. This is why a system that sounds great in one car can sound terrible in a different car. So, as part of my research, I consulted with experts in the car audio industry to get tips and advice that can help you make the best decision as you upgrade your audio equipment.","I consulted with Steve Stern, president of MECA (Mobile Electronics Competition Association). Based in Nashville, Tennessee, MECA is a car audio association that organizes some of the most popular car audio competitions in the U.S. It is the authority on high-end car audio.","I also consulted with a few professional car audio techs from the Sound Warehouse, a local Utah car audio store. They earn their living selling and installing car audio equipment.","Professional Installation<br/>When asked what the most common mistake consumers make is, Stern pointed at the installation. He suggested that you need to &#34;make sure you get the most out of your audio system by doing the best installation possible. A tight install can work to bring out the best in even the most basic, inexpensive equipment.&#34;","The audio techs echoed the same sentiments as they gave me a tour of the shop. They showed me the various wire gauges, connectors, fuses and other equipment in the shop, explaining how it&#39;s often the little things, like the quality of the wiring, that can affect the quality of an audio system. The techs argued that you shouldn&#39;t attempt to install your stereo equipment if you don&#39;t have experience with electrical wiring. You&#39;ll avoid frustration and mistakes while getting the best signals to your speakers if you let a pro do it."]},"id":"b000fec3-0058-4e9e-ac43-056c3c291f9a","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/eoTvV6EXFS6zai9ds3puMJ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/car-audio-systems/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9FL0QvNzU3MzgxL29yaWdpbmFsL0Nhci1BdWRpby1QaW9uZWVyLUFWSC01MDFFWC1UZXN0aW5nLTAwNS5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eoTvV6EXFS6zai9ds3puMJ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"eoTvV6EXFS6zai9ds3puMJ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eoTvV6EXFS6zai9ds3puMJ.jpg","alt":""},"id":"d5e42661-df62-42c0-a1c2-334faee38c75","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/>Matching Compatibility<br/>Another common mistake, according to Stern, is when people fail to get a stereo that is compatible with their speakers. What he&#39;s referencing is the power handling specifications.","Both speakers and stereos have specifications for peak power handling, continuous power handling and impedance. The most important of these is impedance. If your car speakers have an impedance rating of 3 ohm, then you need to make sure your stereo is also rated for 3 ohms. Most stereos are rated for an impedance range, such as 2 to 8 ohms, which means you can use any speakers that have an impedance within that range.","Matching incompatible speakers and stereos can result in blowing the speakers or burning out the stereo&#39;s amplifier. But mostly, you won&#39;t get the best audio performance.","Consider Output Voltage<br/>Most of the car stereos I reviewed have power outputs of about 200 watts overall, or 50 watts per channel. This is plenty of power to reach ear-damaging volumes on four speakers, which I know because I tested the stereos with a decibel meter, and they all reached over 100 dB.","However, you might be interested in expanding your system to additional speakers and a subwoofer, especially if you want to drive high-fidelity speakers. If this is the case, choosing a stereo with a high output voltage is key to getting the best audio. The higher the voltage, the cleaner the signal to the amplifier. This helps minimizes noise in the signal processing through the amp. Typically, this voltage is one of the delineating factors between a high-end stereo (4 volts to 6 volts) and a cheap stereo (1 volt to 2 volts).","Car Speakers<br/>When asked whether you should upgrade your stereo or your car speakers first (assuming both are in working order), Stern said that it depends on how old the stereo is. If the audio system is very old, he recommends replacing the stereo before you replace the speakers. But he also says that if the stereo’s electronics are in good shape, then upgrading to high-performance speakers and adding a &#34;specialized multi-channel amp, or the best amplifier you can afford,&#34; is your next best option for upgrading your audio experience. Lastly, he recommends upgrading the wires connecting the speakers to the amplifier or stereo.","Car Subwoofer<br/>If you want to take your car audio to the next level, adding a 10-inch subwoofer &#34;in a quality box, with most stable power source you can afford&#34; is a great place to start, according to Stern.","Without a subwoofer, your car speakers are charged with producing the entire frequency range. Depending on the type of speaker, this usually means sacrificing midrange detail for good bass or vice versa. But with a subwoofer, you allow the midrange and high frequencies to be played on the car speakers while the woofer takes over the bass. Overall, the audio quality improves and is more accurate.","In addition, subwoofers allow you to feel the music more because bass is the most percussive frequency range. This also adds to the listening experience, making it sound livelier.","Car Amplifier<br/>If you add a subwoofer, you need something to power it because your car stereo isn&#39;t designed to drive a subwoofer&#39;s huge woofers. This means you need to add an amplifier. These devices also allow you to push higher-quality speakers, and they do a better job of separating frequencies.","Acoustic Modifications<br/>Every car has its own unique acoustic landscape. Sometimes the interior is excellent for audio –  other times, not so much. If you&#39;ve upgraded every aspect of your car sound system but are still not happy with the audio, you should consider making acoustic modifications. Typically, this means installing sound dampening pads in the doors and hood. This can minimize road and engine noise, as well as keep the interior from getting too much acoustic feedback.","<strong>What Is a Factory Sound Processor?</strong>","A growing trend in the automotive industry is to build comprehensive in-dash systems, sometimes with large touchscreens resembling a tablet. These systems allow for exceptional functionality through the manufacturer’s system, but it also means it can be very difficult, costly or impossible to replace or upgrade the stereo.","This problem has a lot to do with the way the receiver is tuned by the manufacturer to get the most out of the car’s factory speakers. The tuning shapes the sound to be more dynamic, allowing the cheap speakers to sound pretty good. At first. But eventually the speakers wear out and sound dull. However, if you upgrade the speakers, the audio signal isn’t tuned for the new ones. This often leaves people frustrated after upgrading their speakers only to find the sound quality didn’t improve or got worse.","To fix this issue, you might want to consider a sound processor. Rather than wiring the receiver directly to the speakers, you wire the receiver to the sound processor. It cleans up the signal by removing all the sound-shaping tuning applied by the receiver before sending the signal along to your speakers or amplifier. In this way, it gives you a lot more control over your audio system&#39;s sound quality when you’re unable to upgrade the receiver.","However, a sound processor isn&#39;t a cheap workaround. Even the affordable ones cost about as much as good aftermarket stereos, ranging from between $150 to $800, depending on quality and features. That said, if you’re a serious car audio enthusiast, the high-end processors provide unparalleled control over tuning and the upgraded components you add to it. For example, the $700 Rockford Fosgate 3Sixty.3 connects to your laptop via a USB port so you can use software to completely shape the audio signal to fit your preferences and your vehicle."]},"id":"528a00da-adc1-4c09-ba58-41aeb8277551","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_170","url":"/best-car-audio-systems","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-10T16:51:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-10T16:51:00Z","name":"Best Car Audio Systems of 2019","synopsis":"The best car stereos combine high-fidelity audio with comprehensive playback options and smartphone integration.
