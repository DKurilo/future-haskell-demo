The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-all-in-one-printers\">All-in-One Printers</a> here</em><em>.</em>","The Epson WorkForce for Home WF-3520 all-in-one inkjet printer is an efficient and compact device that offers speedy printing, especially for text, some really appealing resolution for photos and images and a good-sized paper tray holding 250 pages of blank paper.","The Epson WorkForce for Home line presents a number of models that have greater or fewer features than this model. However, the WF-3520 is a modestly priced but multifaceted instrument that can handle home office needs with dispatch and, despite its name, also furnishes plenty of characteristics that would benefit many small offices.","This multifunction all-in-one inkjet printer can print, scan, copy and fax as neatly and well as its larger and more commercial counterparts. You get a great print speed of 15 pages per minute for black and white prints and a decent 9.3 pages per minute for color prints. The best all-in-one printers are faster, but this is quick enough for most users. The resolution is quite good at 570 x 1440 dpi (dots per inch). You get the option of printing wirelessly from nearly anywhere, employing Ethernet connectivity or using a wide variety of memory cards or sticks, depending on the project you have underway.","With this multifunction printer, you can handle borderless and large-size printing jobs, make copies at 13 minutes for black and white and seven minutes for color and enjoy the benefit of an auto page feeder.","You can fax documents at a speed of three seconds per page, the fax memory holds 180 pages and the fax speed dial can retain up to 100 phone numbers.","With the generous print tray holding half a ream of paper, you will not need to replenish the supply all that often. You also get a monthly duty cycle of 12,000 copies, which is quite good for home use and reasonably good for most small businesses.","One drawback: The LCD display panel on this printer is somewhat disappointing since it is only 2.5 inches in size, but it is clearly readable."]},"id":"6db58bce-5457-4854-a769-c1c34f629f3d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"587c8823-b99d-471b-b0a9-c53231d48463","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can increase your home office productivity and keep your small business humming as well with this durable, inexpensive and versatile all-in-one inkjet printer."]},"id":"4d4bea68-39b3-4851-9af0-a33624a5c0a5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56909","url":"/epson-workforce-for-home-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-07-01T16:48:41Z","datePublished":"2013-07-01T16:48:41Z","name":"Epson WorkForce for Home","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our lineup because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
