Each has its own ignition and temperature control knobs. The Char-Broil Gourmet T-47D is the three-burner model. It stands 3 feet high and weighs around 130 pounds. This is comparatively small. But it still has a large grilling area, including 500 square inches of grill space on the main burner.","The T-47D has a lot of power to help it heat up quickly and keep it hot. The primary burner uses a good 22,000 BTUs with another 13,000 BTUs from the side burner. This means your steaks will cook from the inside out keeping moisture in and tasting as good as those you order from your favorite steakhouse.","The Char-Broil Gourmet infrared BBQ grill uses gas, though you can purchase a conversion kit and use natural gas, too. These units also come with lighted knobs, temperature gauge, warming rack and side tables. It doesn&#39;t come with a smoker box or rotisserie rack, features that are found on the best infrared grill. However, these items are available to purchase separately if you would like them.","When you receive your Gourmet grill, it will need to be assembled. Char-Broil offers some great support options in case you need help. In addition to phone and email support, you can search the FAQs section or browse through an electronic version of the user guide. It also has a live chat feature, something that the other grill manufactures don&#39;t have. If you discover something is missing or broken, Char-Broil has a one-year warranty on the grill so you can expect to get replacement parts."]},"id":"dab2aae0-edbf-4882-9cf9-2e28c0b72aeb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7686db5f-3809-40e0-ad12-f01c6b647daf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Char-Broil Gourmet infrared grill series comes with an impressive amount of power to help cook up your meat just right.
