The speed control is responsive, and the train topped out at 2.17 feet per second, making it the fastest model we played with.

This unit is operated by a power pack you plug into an electrical socket.

While many trains started failing after the second of four drop tests, this model’s engine didn’t have any external damage until the very last drop.

It earned a B+ for overall design and detail because while many of our testers loved it, this children’s train obviously isn’t model-grade and probably isn’t a teenager’s dream. The headlamp works, and the train makes chuffing sounds as it circles the track. You can also activate bells, whistles and audio with the remote.

HO scale trains are more middle-of-the-road and often seen at model train trade shows.","Each scale letter corresponds to how much a train has been shrunk down from its size in real life. For instance, N scale is equivalent to 1:160, so 160 inches on a real train equals 1 inch on the model. In this scenario, a 40-foot boxcar becomes a mere 3.25 inches long."]},"id":"f22b1d7b-0706-40a1-b9fe-386be21a91fd","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/tA3fHixFFjK3sFREVRB77F.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/trains-testing/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9XLzEvODA1OTY5L29yaWdpbmFsL01vZGVsLVRyYWlucy1UZXN0aW5nLTAwNC5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tA3fHixFFjK3sFREVRB77F.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"tA3fHixFFjK3sFREVRB77F","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tA3fHixFFjK3sFREVRB77F.jpg","alt":""},"id":"a6dfa179-1bb2-4d68-b074-2e8f094c1713","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Scale measurements:<br/>N - 1:160<br/>HO - 1:87.1<br/>O - 1:48<br/>On30 - 1:48 (appears smaller due to thinner track)<br/>G - 1:22.5+<br/><br/>Safety<br/>We highly recommend some parent supervision when children use any of these trains, particularly if they’re young. Many of the models we tested have small metal parts that could be easily broken off and swallowed. Each train set includes a recommended age range, so make sure you read the fine print before leaving little Billy unattended with a bunch of small parts. Depending on the age of your child they might need assistance to install the proper batteries. Electrically powered trains will spark if moved along the track incorrectly, which is also a safety hazard. Some trains also come with liquid smoke, and it’s important not to ingest any of the product."]},"id":"eb494625-a47d-4ed7-8b5b-97ac5079db4e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/aebrZQWzHqbx8S5KjJAxT6.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/trains-testing/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9XLzAvODA1OTY4L29yaWdpbmFsL01vZGVsLVRyYWlucy1UZXN0aW5nLTAwMS5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aebrZQWzHqbx8S5KjJAxT6.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"aebrZQWzHqbx8S5KjJAxT6","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aebrZQWzHqbx8S5KjJAxT6.jpg","alt":""},"id":"ef7b13ab-3ff3-4815-b5fe-6ffe6b2dfdff","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Customizing Your Train</strong>","There are a lot of ways experienced hobbyists can customize trains and other accessories. One way to make your train really stand out is by painting it. First, you need to strip the paint off the train&#39;s exterior. You can buy paint stripping liquid at most hardware stores, but you can also try soaking the parts of the train that don&#39;t have electronics in them in alcohol. Once you&#39;ve stripped the paint, an airbrush is one of the best ways to add your own colors, though a kit can be expensive. Set up a painting booth for safe air brushing and to protect other items in your house. Very small paint brushes are best for getting the finer details perfect.","There are also a lot of ways to customize your track and terrain. As long as it&#39;s the correct size and type of track, you can add track switches, which can take your train in different directions. This means you can add on virtually endless miles of track and guide your train around the room. You can also purchase additional scenery pieces like stores, signs and foliage. In addition, you can get creative with things you already have at home and build entire worlds for your train to travel through. Most scenery pieces can also be customized with paint. When it comes to hobby trains, if you can dream it, odds are you can do it. It’s part of what makes the hobby so much fun."]},"id":"1a414969-311c-4563-a979-ad0925726767","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"2c9c316b-9cb2-48e0-9642-bb13c40fe576","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/lionel-pennsylvania-flyer-freight-train-review\">Lionel Pennsylvania Flyer</a>","<a href=\"/bachmann-chattanooga-review\">Bachmann Chattanooga</a>","<a href=\"/mickey-mouse-train-set-review\">Micky Mouse Express</a>","<a href=\"/bachmann-freightmaster-review\">Bachmann Freightmaster</a>","<a href=\"/athearn-iron-horse-review\">Athearn Iron Horse </a>","<a href=\"/lionel-polar-express-train-set-review\">Lionel Polar Express</a>","<a href=\"/santa-fe-blue-lightning-review\">Santa Fe Blue Lightning</a>","<a href=\"/haktoys-train-king-choo-choo-series-review\">Haktoys Train King Choo Choo Series</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"e0945ce2-38ae-45bc-ab4b-861bf0828e49","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_145","url":"/best-train-sets","authors":[{"email":"anna.burleson@futurenet.com","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-18T18:10:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-18T18:10:00Z","name":"Best Train Sets of 2019","synopsis":"Model trains are a Christmas favorite, but they are fun all-year round.
