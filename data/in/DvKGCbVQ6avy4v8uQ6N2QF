Rather than one tool outperforming the rest, as is common in a <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-multi-tools\">multi-tool</a>, the SOG multi-tool presents 12 tools that all perform above average.","Testers opened the SwitchPlier with a simple push of a button, even with gloved, cold and wet hands. In trial use, it outperformed all others when snipping through thick wire, requiring only a single squeeze with constant medium pressure. The design minimizes the potential for hand and finger pinching as well.","Because of the tool&#39;s lighter-weight frame – weighing in at 6.2 oz – testers found it took a bit of finesse to drive screws and cut through rope. However, its value lies in its snipping ability, as proved in the trial use, with its pruning shears-like design that provide additional clipping power, if it&#39;s needed. It is also a relatively cheap multi-tool when compared to others Active Junky tested.","<strong>Key Attribute: </strong>Total Utility","<strong>Best For: </strong>Adventures to everyday tasks, and a great choice for emergency preparedness","<strong>Testing Comments:</strong> &#34;If putting up wood for the winter (or night campfire, really) is the game, SOG lights it up with nearly angry saw performance. Easy-to-use jaws release from their stored position with a single, finger-actuated switch that never failed. Hands stay safe, wood gets piled high and prying chores handled with finesse. Rope cutting was a minor disappointment, but the overall utility couldn’t be denied.&#34;","<strong>Trial Results</strong>"]},"id":"8d417b47-ab74-43d1-9901-9f97f792b103","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Point Break:</strong> The best multi-tool performer in this trial, the SwitchPlier succeeded in easy, single-handed clean clips every time.","<strong>Around the Bend:</strong> Although there was little jaw deflection when manipulating the wire, significant power was required to complete the S bends.","<strong>Rope &#39;Em In:</strong> The straight-tip section of the combo straight and serrated blade proved to be not very effective, and experienced technique was required to efficiently and safely complete this trial.","<strong>No Turning Back:</strong> The driver heads offer very little torque and will only be effective with light-duty tasks.","<strong>Eyes on the Pries: </strong>Testers used the file tip for the prying test and found it offered superior strength and control for steady prying tasks.","<strong>Lumberjack Olympics:</strong> The straight section of the combo blade deflected when pressure was applied.
