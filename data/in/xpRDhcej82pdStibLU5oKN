You can expect great audio monitoring quality from this baby video monitor, and the video monitoring is decent. However, the battery life is disappointingly short, and the support options aren&#39;t as expansive as many of its competitors&#39;.","Foscam boasts a transmission range of 1,000 feet between the FBM3501&#39;s parent and child units. This is the longest advertised transmission range of all the products on our lineup. You should take this number with a grain of salt, though. Manufacturers test the range of products like video baby monitors in an open field. This means that, under the best possible circumstances, the FBM3501 should transmit up to 1,000 feet. That likely won&#39;t be the case in a home, where there are walls and other interferences to deal with.","With a 3.5-inch screen, the video feed has enough real estate on the monitor to keep you from squinting to see your baby. This isn&#39;t the largest screen we&#39;ve seen on video baby monitors, but it&#39;s much better than the common 2.4-inch screens.","Two-way talk, sound-activated lights and voice activation are all things that we considered in our baby video monitor reviews. The FBM3501 has all of these. The only thing it&#39;s lacking in the audio monitoring category is an audio-only mode, which would allow you to turn off the video feed and use the device like a traditional baby video monitor. This would help expand the FBM3501&#39;s disappointing battery life.","You can only use the FBM3501 for about four consecutive hours before the battery needs to be juiced up again. This is not enough time to allow you to multitask around the house all day while keeping an eye on your baby. You can watch the video feed with the monitor plugged in, but that eliminates any mobility that the FBM3501 has."]},"id":"ea6e90dc-1568-4143-af88-8ba406015006","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fdb491fd-1ebc-4a20-869e-a43eeb596165","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Foscam has a competent device in the FBM3501, but it&#39;s missing some key features that keep it from being among the best video baby monitors.
