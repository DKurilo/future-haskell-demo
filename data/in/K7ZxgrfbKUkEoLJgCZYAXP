While it isn&#39;t the best <a href=\"/best-toaster-ovens\">toaster oven</a> in our review, it is well priced. The manufacturer sells this unit for roughly $50, a price that is on the lower side for convection ovens. At the time of publication, we were able to find it selling on Amazon for slightly under $35. So, if you keep tabs on it, you might be able to find it at a much more affordable price.","This toaster produced evenly toasted bread slices and bagels during our tests. However, it didn&#39;t perform quite as well in our burrito, cookie dough and pizza reheating test. The burrito was a little cold in the middle, but showed some browning around the edges of the tortilla. The cookie dough took a few minutes longer than others to cook through and by that time the tops and edges had become singed. Definitely not the best outcome for cookie lovers. Finally, the pizza crust came out somewhat hard and crunchy leaving overcooked cheese and burnt pepperoni.","This device ran a little on the hot side, heating to 14 degrees above the selected temperature. I was also the least accurate toaster oven in our testing, but it wasn&#39;t enough to ruin our cooking sessions. If you anticipate the ten-degree difference, you should be able to use this toaster oven to achieve the cooking results you want. You can set this device anywhere between 150 and 450 degrees, which gives you a wider range to work with than many of the other toasters we tested. This unit is covered by a two-year warranty, which is longer than average and good for a cheaper toaster oven.","There is no digital screen and no touchpad on this device. However, you can set the dial timer for up to 60 minutes. The racks are large enough to fit six slices of toast at once, so you can cook a decent amount of food in one go. During our cooking sessions, we found this device harder to plug in and place on the counter than others since the cord was so short. If you think you&#39;ll need a longer cord to stay safe, you might be interested in <a href=\"/hamilton-beach-31126-review\">Hamilton Beach 31126</a>. Unfortunately, there is no non-stick coating on the interior of the oven, but the crumb tray was easy enough to remove and clean.","This device&#39;s exterior was one of the hottest we measured. The backside reached 126 degrees while the sides and top reached up to 186 degrees. Couple this with the short cord and you&#39;ll definitely want to take care not to have anything near this device while it operates to prevent burning. Fortunately, the handle still remains relatively cool to the touch so you can grasp it without burning yourself."]},"id":"88d4d25a-4393-4e02-9db4-0511a88fba5c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f62476cb-ea41-478a-ab09-72a5a1ad99a4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Black + Decker TO1675B is a powerful toaster that produces decent results but runs a little warmer than needed.
