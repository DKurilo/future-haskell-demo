Unfortunately, this walkie talkie is not waterproof, and the belt clip is not as strong as the rest of the unit.","In our range tests, this unit communicated fairly well up to 1 mile on both high and low-power frequencies. But when we increased the range to 1.5 and 2 miles in the on the low-power FRS frequency, the MR350R dropped out completely, not registering any of our transmissions. It did perform much better at longer test distances on the higher-power GMRS frequency, but you need an FCC license to operate these frequencies.","The MR350R has a backlit display that shows you the available charge on the rechargeable battery, and if you run out of power in the woods, you can use three AA batteries instead of the rechargeable pack. If you want to charge up the battery pack on-the-go this walkie talkie has a mini-USB port on the side.","The MR350R scans NOAA weather channels and sends you an alert if there is emergency weather in your area. If you get stuck and need help, the walkie talkie has an emergency alert button. However, this button is usually used to warn others about nearby dangers. You can use it to program an SOS and send it with a press of a button.","With features like a headset jack, hands-free communication, privacy codes and noise canceling, the Motorola Talkabout MR350R has all the best features of a modern walkie talkie. The individual two-way radios weigh less than half a pound, so if you do take these walkie talkies out on a trip or long hike, you won&#39;t feel the weight.","The MR350R was one of the lightest walkie talkie sets that we tested, weighing in at only 6.1 ounces per unit with batteries inserted. That being said, because the walkie talkie is so light and doesn’t have any rubber to give it grip, our reviewers reported that the unit felt like it was going to slip out their hands. As a result, we ranked this walkie talkie radio as the worst of the units for grip.","The belt clip for the MR350R is the same style as that of the more expensive Cobra models we tested. The clip can rotate and the unit moves with it, which is nice, but overall the clip is awkward and not as sturdy as the rest of the device. It can break under pressure.","Another mark against the design of the MR350R is the fact that Motorola didn’t give the unit any protection against water. The unit has no IPX rating, which means it’s not even rated to withstand a rain shower or a drip from a water bottle. For a device which is sure to see a lot of outdoor use, this isn’t ideal. The MR350R was one of only two walkie talkies we tested that lacked any kind of waterproofing, and the complete lack of grip made it our least favorite design.","Motorola supports the MR350R with a one-year warranty. Although this isn&#39;t the best warranty we&#39;ve seen, it is good for a device that may take a beating. You can also find help online by chatting with a customer support representative or by downloading the radio’s user manual. We couldn’t find FAQs for the MR350R,  but customer service representatives are available by phone and email.","The Motorola Talkabout MR350R is a sturdy walkie talkie with average range and a wide selection of features. Unfortunately, it is not waterproof, and the belt clip has a tendency to break. Still, the rest of the radio feels like a high-quality device, and the many features are great for campers and hikers."]},"id":"d1d62715-f731-4704-8cf4-7075944233be","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"37765c79-04c2-4b09-a908-a8f25881f66b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Motorola Talkabout MR350R is a sturdy walkie talkie with average area coverage and a wide range of tools.
