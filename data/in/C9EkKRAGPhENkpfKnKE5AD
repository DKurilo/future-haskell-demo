While Goodyear isn&#39;t the most affordable tire brand on average, the many performance options per tire size is impressive and provides a greater range of competitive pricing and performance than other brands. In addition, the overall tread-life warranties are above-average. And unlike most tire brands, you can buy tires directly from Goodyear and have them shipped for free to the local service station of your choosing. For these reasons, Goodyear is my pick for the best tire brand overall.","<strong>Price</strong>","To evaluate the prices of Goodyear, I recorded the prices of every tire option for common sedan sizes, SUV sizes and truck sizes.

However, Goodyear offers more tire options, with some tires priced in the low $90 range and premium performance tires priced closer to $120.

But with far more performance options than other tire brands, the prices vary a lot. This means you can find an all-season SUV tire competitively priced with a Cooper tire, but you can also choose a premium, high-performance tire. For example, the Goodyear Kelly Edge A/S costs just $128 per tire, but the Ultra Grip Ice WRT winter tires cost $200 per tire.","Goodyear&#39;s truck tires are far more affordable compared to other truck tires at $205 per tire. With 15 tire options for the most common truck tire size, there is a wider range of prices, from affordable all-season tires as low as $169 and high-performance all-terrain Kevlar-lined tires at $226.","In addition, Goodyear is among the few tire brands where you can buy the tires directly from the brand&#39;s website while receiving free shipping to your local service station for installation. This adds value to the brand and makes it much easier to track your purchase and make a claim on a tread-life warranty if the tires turn out to be a dud.","<strong>Tread-Life Warranty</strong>","Goodyear&#39;s tread-life warranty covers 31 tire series.
