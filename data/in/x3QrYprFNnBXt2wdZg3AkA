XYZprinting flagship printer, da Vinci 1.0, is a good <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">budget 3D printer</a> choice for first-time and young users. The plug-and-play features make 3D printing simple with very little installation and calibration required for your first print job. This very approachable printer also doesn’t skimp on features or quality, as it also houses a very large print area, a navigation screen and a full cartridge of included filament.","The da Vinci 1.0 can print items up to nearly 8 x 8 x 8 inches in size. The printer is much larger than 8 x 8 x 8 inches, so the maximum print size seems a bit small for such a large machine.","Like most 3D printers, print quality depends on print speed and resolution settings. With the included software, you can change the quality mode and speed settings, which range from 0.1 millimeters to 0.4 millimeters per second. During our print quality testing, we found that the da Vinci 1.0 prints decent-quality models. While the prints’ surfaces weren’t the best we saw, models printed quickly, accurately and without defects. Also, the leveling feature ensures your printed parts have a solid foundation to build on. Prints made using the da Vinci 1.0 are best for school activities, presents, prototypes and other nonprofessional projects.","This 55-pound printer is surprisingly easy to set up and use. Everything comes already calibrated, and you can access further calibration options from the menu screen. Inside the printer, there is a drip tray and an extruder cleaner the machine uses to self-clean, and they are both extremely useful and convenient. These unique features make using the da Vinci 1.0 simple and fun, and they cut down on maintenance and cleaning time.","The printer is fully enclosed, and you can access your finished prints by the front door. A safely enclosed design like this is great for teaching young children about 3D printing without worrying about little hands touching the hot components. The internal light system lights the printer up similar to a microwave. When you&#39;re not actively using the printer or a print is in progress, the lights are off. When you&#39;re calibrating, changing the cartridge or just starting a print, the lights are on.","Printing is very quiet, as the enclosed print area muffles much of the noise. Although there is a long heat up and cool down process, the XYZprinting da Vinci 1.0 beeps when it&#39;s finished or needs your input on the screen. You also hear a beep when your print is done, just like when your dryer finishes with a batch of laundry. An accurate time estimate also displays on the screen, so you know if it will take an hour or five minutes to print your creation.","Since the cartridges sit in a custom slot inside the printer itself, you need to purchase cartridges straight from the manufacturer. The good news is you can purchase filament refills from XYZprinting or from various retailers – just be aware that the refill needs to fit inside the cartridge or you have to wrap the filament in a cartridge yourself. However, the cartridge compartment keeps your filament from tangling and is a very convenient feature. There are numerous color options, although there are more ABS colors available than PLA. The platform is heated, so you can successfully print with either filament.","The da Vinci 1.0 comes with three preinstalled models, and you can either download the free software from the website or from the included CD. This 3D printer can only print via USB cable, as there isn&#39;t an SD card slot. Since the printer must be tethered at all times during the print process, make sure you have a large enough space near your dedicated computer for your print station.","Maintenance tools are provided with the da Vinci 1.0, so you can easily clean the machine and pry models off the bed when they&#39;re finished. Since your first full filament cartridge is included for free, this cuts down on the cost of your initial purchase. At 600 grams, you are given much more filament than is usually provided with comparable affordable 3D printers.","A one-year warranty covers the da Vinci 1.0, which is a good deal longer than most budget and regular-price 3D printers. Support materials are available on the company’s website, including product documentation, user guides, tutorial videos, software and updates."]},"id":"5eb70b81-0c02-452f-9687-b59d48637e42","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2190e248-6f15-4d95-89ef-d9de9ded9fa5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The XYZprinting da Vinci 1.0 is a great budget 3D printer because it&#39;s suited to any skill level, self-calibrating and self-cleaning, and it prints quality objects.
