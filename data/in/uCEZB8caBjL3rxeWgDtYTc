It is a VISA card and can be used wherever VISA is accepted. This is not a credit card and doesn&#39;t require a credit check to sign up for. Some services are only available if you sign up for direct deposit.","As with all prepaid debit cards, Vision Premier has many fees. Some fees, such as the monthly fee, are lower if you have direct deposit or make a certain number of transactions a month. There are still fees for ATM withdrawals and using an ATM to look at your balance. The balance inquiry fee was the highest of all the cards we reviewed. You can find a listing of all the fees at Vision Premier&#39;s website.","Vision Premiere has many strong features that make it a good option for when you consider a reloadable prepaid debit card. It offers text alerts for when payments clear, discount offers, daily balances and a variety of other things. Vision Premier also offers a roadside-assistance service that helps you if you have a flat tire or get locked out. A savings account and cashback rewards program for buying gas round out the features for this card","In addition to direct deposit, you can add funds to you Vision Premier account through bank transfers, MoneyPak, Western Union and PayPal. You can also transfer funds from one Vision Premier card to another for free. One of Vision Premier&#39;s biggest drawbacks is the low maximum balance on its cards. This is one of the lowest maximum balances and prevents Vision Premier from being as useful as some of the other cards we reviewed.","Vision Premier offers FAQs on its website in addition to email and telephone support. If you are not enrolled in direct deposit, you are charged a live agent fee for getting help over the phone. If you choose Vision Premier as your reloadable debit card, we recommend signing up for direct deposit as you will save substantially on fees."]},"id":"1644d1fa-9422-4a76-bfd4-12cd9e01a60d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"46cbac3a-d8ea-4b27-8840-c92e8c4d1d86","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Vision Premier has some features other cards don&#39;t, like a roadside-assistance plan and a cash reward program when you use the card to buy gas.
