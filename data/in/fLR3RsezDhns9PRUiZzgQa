Spotloans are installment loans, so they can be paid back over a longer period of time than the 14-day term of a traditional payday loan. The maximum term of a Spotloan is eight months. Spotloan&#39;s APRs are highly competitive for this industry, and it provides excellent customer service.","Since a federally recognized Native American tribe operates this company, it does not have to follow the laws of your state of residence. Instead, every business transaction you make with Spotloan is legally considered as taking place on tribal land, so the transaction follows the laws of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians of North Dakota. This can be good or bad. On the one hand, you know exactly what you&#39;re getting into when you sign up for a loan and don&#39;t have to worry about how the laws of your state apply to the transaction. On the other hand, you aren&#39;t protected by your state&#39;s lending laws. Be sure you thoroughly read your contract so that you understand and agree with Spotloan&#39;s terms."]},"id":"02a12cdb-5be4-426a-9eb1-b280619f2b73","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Test"},"id":"66f18ccf-0c77-4100-b758-ff50abd38549","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/7nBrfoXypKwYMqKodriE53.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"This direct payday lender charges between 360 percent and 390 percent APR. This is not a large range compared to other lenders, and other companies offer lower minimum APRs. However, its highest rate is very competitive in this industry.  Still, the cost of a loan can quickly become astronomical. We calculated the cost of a loan at Spotloan&#39;s best and worst rates for a period of 212 days, which is the amount of time most borrowers are indebted to their first payday loan. If you take out an $800 loan at Spotloan&#39;s best rate for 212 days, you must pay back $1,672.76 on top of the original $800. At Spotloan&#39;s highest rate, you would need to pay $1,812.16 in interest and fees. Note that when we compared costs between services, we used $1,000 as a base amount for all of the companies we reviewed. However, since you can only borrow up to $800 from Spotloan, we have calculated the numbers for an $800 loan for this specific review.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/67356-netloan2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7nBrfoXypKwYMqKodriE53.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"7nBrfoXypKwYMqKodriE53","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7nBrfoXypKwYMqKodriE53.jpg","alt":""},"id":"54756383-6f04-4b32-815e-0a55b428feb6","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Keep in mind that while Spotloan rates are competitive for this industry, its maximum APR of 360 percent is far above the maximum rate you&#39;d pay for a personal loan, credit card cash advance or peer-to-peer loan.

Its customer support representatives were willing and able to answer our questions over the phone, and they did not push us to apply for a loan. They were responsive via email, as well. Additionally, Spotloan&#39;s website is highly transparent about its rates, fees and terms, and such information is important so that you know what you are getting into before you apply for a loan. These things earned Spotloan a customer service score of 100 percent.
