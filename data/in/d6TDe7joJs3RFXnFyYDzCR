You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.","The Nook HD is an <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eBook reader</a> that will provide your family hours of entertainment and enjoyment. This device allows you to set up six different profiles, so you will only see your personal content instead of wading through the content of your whole family. Additionally, there are more than three million books available from Barnes and Noble, so you will never run out of reading material.","The Nook HD eReader offers a 7-inch touchscreen, which is similar in size to many paperback books. It weighs just over 11 ounces, so you will have no trouble holding the device for long periods. Barnes and Noble also offers the Nook HD+. The main difference in these eReaders is the size. The HD+ is larger, weighing 18.2 ounces and measuring 9.46 x 6.41 x 0.45 inches. While the larger screen size is nice, the added inches on the HD+ make it less desirable if you&#39;re looking for something you can easily throw in a bag and take with you. Both devices come with a laminated screen, which reduces glare and provides no room for air pockets. The Nook HD is also available in two different colors, Snow and Smoke, while the Nook HD+ is only available in Slate.","Another difference between the Nook HD and the HD+ is the screen resolution. Both are incredible. The Nook HD features a 720p HD display and 1440 x 900 resolution that is well above average for most eReaders. The HD+, however, boasts a full HD display at 1080p with 1920 x 1280 resolution. Both resolutions provide clear and crisp images when you&#39;re watching movies and TV on this device.","Barnes and Noble offers more than three million books to download onto your eReader, including a wide selection of children&#39;s books. Many of these children&#39;s books are also interactive, making learning fun and entertaining for kids. Additionally, you have access to more than 230 magazines and 36 different newspapers. Moreover, if you subscribe to the hard copy of some magazines, you can also receive the digital edition on your Nook HD or HD+ without incurring any additional cost.","The Nook HD comes with either 8GB or 16GB of storage space, while the HD+ comes with either 16GB or 32GB. If you still need more storage, you can purchase a mircoSD card that contains up to 64GB of storage space and works with both devices. These options will allow you to save your favorite books, music and even movies without running out of space. Both of these eReaders provide about 10 hours of reading time, or approximately 9 hours of movie watching, time on a single charge.","The Nook HD and HD+ offer more features to heighten your eBook reader experience, such as Wi-Fi for web access and Nook Scrapbook, which allows you to mark items to review later. When you visit a Barnes and Noble store, you can access its Wi-Fi free of charge and download any content that you desire. Unfortunately, neither eReader offers text-to-speech functionality. Another disappointment was discovered when we clicked on the music player only to realize we can&#39;t buy music through Barnes &amp; Noble. Of course, you do have the option of loading your own music onto the device or downloading an app.","These are the best eBook readers for families because both of them allow you to create up to six different profiles. This option means each person can keep their own content under their profile. Additionally, parents have the option of setting up parental controls on these devices to keep their children safe from objectionable material. This feature also allows parents to monitor and evaluate children&#39;s purchases as well their online activity. Barnes &amp; Noble even has a Kids Nook Store so you can be sure they won&#39;t stumble upon inappropriate content."]},"id":"8e1dce87-56b9-4188-9982-51cae6e434e9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0e4ce902-fb4f-4828-b180-e271b9ffed20","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Barnes and Noble Nook HD and Nook HD+ lack text-to-speech features and a music store; however, they make up for that with other features such as the Nook Scrapbook and the amount of content that is available.
