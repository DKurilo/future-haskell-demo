And while this isn’t a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, the connection between the computer, mouse and keyboard is just as easy to set up as a Bluetooth connection would be. Customizable hot keys are located along the top of the keyboard, although F9-F11 only work with HP TouchSmart PCs. The only additional features on the keyboard are sound controls on the upper right corner.","Unlike other wireless keyboard and mouse combos on the market, the HP Wireless Elite Keyboard and Mouse combo doesn’t have battery level indicators directly on the products; instead, these indicators are in your Windows System Tray (usually located in the bottom right corner of your computer screen, near the date and time).  While it is always good to keep an eye on the battery levels, HP has made sure that with their sleep mode feature and convenient on/off switch that time between battery replacements is extended. The average life of the keyboard is 12 months and the mouse averages around four months. When either product needs replacing, their icon in the Windows System Tray will turn red."]},"id":"63468b3d-05dc-4549-84e5-a64e999f3e6f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Mouse Surface Accuracy"},"id":"26780be4-2ba3-4707-8598-911890d68621","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Wireless Elite Keyboard and Mouse have by far the sleekest, most appealing design of any other wireless keyboard and mouse on the market.

This design not only makes for spill resistant keys but also keys that are almost silent to the touch. Users boast that their typing efficiency skyrockets upon implementing this keyboard into their daily regimen.","The mouse matches the keyboard but isn’t anything special. It has two primary buttons (like a normal mouse) and a clickable scroll wheel. You can turn it off on the back side where the receiver can also be handily stowed away. Although small and lightweight, the mouse doesn’t have any specific ergonomic design features and neither does the keyboard. But the mouse’s biggest plus is its ambidextrous design.
