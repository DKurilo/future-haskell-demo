Although rated with a top-end resolution 1080P, this camera struggled in our night vision recording tests. It scored a 52 percent on our Video Quality Night test, well below the average of 67 percent. The recorded video came out dark, making it difficult to view details and movement. However, this <a href=\"/best-nanny-cams\">wireless nanny cam</a> recorded much better during the day. It earned a 96 percent in our daylight testing, with the only drawback being a slight blurriness.","This nanny cam is restricted in recording options. While most units we reviewed have at least two modes, this one only has continuous recording. This is inconvenient because you’ll need to sift through numerous files to find useful footage, as everything is recorded. You also need to regularly upload the footage to your computer or else new footage will be recorded over it. Although these two disadvantages make using this hidden nanny cam inconvenient, this unit can record audio. The audio recordings came out clear and easy to understand.","The simplicity of this nanny cam does create one advantage – it&#39;s incredibly easy to use. All you need to do is plug it into an outlet and it automatically starts recording. There is nothing to set up or buttons to press. Just plug it in to record and take it out when you want to review the footage. There is also no external storage. It&#39;s integrated in the device. You just plug in the USB cable to your computer and you can access the footage. No need to worry about losing an SD card or needing an SD card reader.","In addition, this camera is also inconspicuously designed. The camera lens is small and blends well with the black surface. The indication light only turns on when you plug it in, then stops after three flashes. It looks like a normal wall charger, and it even works as one. You can plug in your phone&#39;s charger cable and charge your phone, so no one will think twice or suspect that the wall unit is actually a camera."]},"id":"f3e42a28-c214-43e8-a553-60325ea66aef","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a44a3d31-415c-49f4-8281-5f27a4e80ec3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The SpygearGadgets USB Wall Charger camera is designed to be effortlessly used.
