Grab a pair of bass headphones and enjoy your own private performance. Headphones with great bass provide that deep, heartbeat quality that makes you want to dance. The unique, pumping sound of good bass is tough to achieve without sound leakage and angry neighbors, so look for over-ear models to seal in every decibel.","Bass headphones come with a wide range of features to boost the deep bass of your music library. Noise isolation technology, inline remotes and soft ear cushions and headbands keep your bass booming in comfort and style. Check out the top-ranked <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">V-MODA Crossfade M-100</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sennheiser-momentum-wireless,review-2797.html\">Sennheiser Momentum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sony-mdr-xb950bt-headphones,review-2959.html\">Sony MDR-1R</a> models that will surround you more completely with the bass of your <a href=\"/electronics\">favorite tracks.</a>","<strong>Bass Headphones: What to Look For</strong>","Not only should your headphones deliver great bass, they should also produce superior sound quality. To appease the audiophile in you, look for specs that not only enhance bass, but that work with your gear and fit your lifestyle. The best headphones for bass will be comfortable, compatible and convenient, so consider the following features before you buy:","<strong>Performance</strong><br/>When searching for the best bass headphones, sound quality is everything. Don&#39;t just turn up the bass on your EQ settings; find headphones that are designed to enhance the bass. Larger driver sizes, lower frequency responses and closed, over-ear phones help produce the deepest, strongest bass.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>Mix your bass headphones into your life seamlessly by making sure your music devices and equipment are compatible. Check for features, such as an inline remote or microphone, that are compatible with your iPhone or Android devices. Also, look for other included features like a storage case to keep your headphones safe and sound when you&#39;re not listening to your beats.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>Not only do you want your headphones to sound great, you want them to look and feel great. Comfort is a key priority when listening to head pounding tunes all day. Look for headphones that adjust to your head and don&#39;t weigh you down while you&#39;re jamming. Protect your ears from damage with over-ear styles that can isolate noise so you don&#39;t have to crank the volume to feel that low, booming bass.","<strong>Help and Support </strong><br/>If anything should happen to your headphones, make sure customer support is there to help you fix or replace your purchase. Remember, the longer the warranty, the better your piece of mind. Many manufacturers have online resources, including manuals and FAQs, and some give you the ability to chat live with a technical support representative.","All of our top-ranked bass headphones produce strong, deep bass and rank high in each of the above categories. Evaluating your new pair of bass headphones according these criteria will ensure you have that chill-inducing music experience only booming bass can provide."]},"id":"57ee0fde-9302-417d-b560-c8638347892c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"cbc26a5c-7c77-4638-a6af-52fabe158c70","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A39PPDK/?&tag=ttr_bassheadphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1074[art|NA[pid|56481[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">V-MODA Crossfade M-100</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009QV15DU?tag=ttr_bassheadphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1074[art|NA[pid|56482[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sennheiser Momentum</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009A6CZ30/?&tag=ttr_bassheadphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1074[art|NA[pid|56485[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sony MDR-1R</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008EQ1ZAG/?&tag=ttr_bassheadphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1074[art|NA[pid|56483[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Beats Executive</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008XEYT48/?&tag=ttr_bassheadphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1074[art|NA[pid|56492[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">beyerdynamic Custom One Pro</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IHUHGE/?&tag=ttr_bassheadphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1074[art|NA[pid|56484[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Bowers &amp; Wilkins P5</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0092T84HQ/?&tag=ttr_bassheadphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1074[art|NA[pid|56486[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Yamaha Pro 500</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00858I4F2/?&tag=ttr_bassheadphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1074[art|NA[pid|56488[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Denon AH-D600</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007DCCK60/?&tag=ttr_bassheadphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1074[art|NA[pid|56487[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sony MDR-MA900</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LAIEN4/?&tag=ttr_bassheadphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1074[art|NA[pid|56491[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Monster Inspiration</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00858I51U/?&tag=ttr_bassheadphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1074[art|NA[pid|56489[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Denon AH-D400</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00018MSNI/?&tag=ttr_bassheadphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1074[art|NA[pid|56490[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sennheiser HD 650</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"15baf328-9744-4f97-adfc-d5dc2ba95ed4","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1074","url":"/best-bass-headphones","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"bethany-gordon","url":"/author/bethany-gordon","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Bethany Gordon","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"tegXFQJXWkzcKPbfwtRhn7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-24T19:39:58Z","datePublished":"2013-06-11T15:27:51Z","name":"Bass Headphones Review","synopsis":"Find the best headphones for bass by looking at our side-by-side comparisons of the market's best bass headphones.","review":{},"strapline":"Find the best headphones for bass by looking at our side-by-side comparisons of the market's best bass headphones.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-03-13T21:05:10Z","id":"Uaterw8AVADQVry7Y8j879","meta":{"title":"The Best Bass Headphones - Top Ten Reviews","description":"Which is the best bass headphone for you?
