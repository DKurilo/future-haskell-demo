This lawn-edging tool comes with a 2.5-horsepower, two-stroke engine that gives you the power you need. The power of this commercial-grade engine makes it possible to do heavy-duty tasks without excessive repairs.","The 10.5-millimeter drive shaft is solid steel. In addition, the engine has a two-step air filtration setup, which protects the engine and provides easy transfer of power to the cutting blade.","The fuel tank holds 77.8 fluid ounces of gasoline, letting you get far on a tank of gas when using this gas edger. The carburetor mixes gas and air effectively using a proprietary process that provides power. The electronic transistorized ignition system makes for easy fire-up at a low rpm, and this helps when the engine is cold. The cylinders are also chrome plated, which provides engine protection. The starting system is standard recoil, as opposed to a push-button start.","The weight of the unit is 54 pounds. The blade has nine different positions, and setting the forged steel blade height is easy with this lawn-edging tool&#39;s height adjustment system.","The blade is 10 inches in length and can cut to a depth of 3 inches. Both the front and rear wheels are 8 inches and made of rubber, which is good at getting through difficult terrain. The blade-adjust feature helps by keeping the rear wheel flat when you&#39;re going through high grass. In addition, the high torque makes it easy for the edger to cut through even the toughest roots.","Sale of this edger in California is not possible due to emission issues. The noise ratio is low, but the machine still requires ear protection for commercial use.","The edger comes with a two-year commercial warranty. It also has a seven-year residential use warranty and a one-year warranty for rentals.","The Tanaka TLE-600 combines a powerful, efficient engine with features that add to its durability and sustained use. The extensive warranty offers abundant protection and peace of mind for both commercial and residential use."]},"id":"000bb5bd-ea2f-42b2-95d3-8b07679e2752","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63489","url":"/tanaka-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-13T17:04:06Z","datePublished":"2015-03-13T17:04:06Z","name":"Tanaka TLE-600","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
