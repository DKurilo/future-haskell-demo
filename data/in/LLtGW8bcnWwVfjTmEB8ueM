It comes with a factory-wound spool of line that Homelite has already installed in the trimmer. The electric weed trimmer has two handles.","The Homelite electric trimmers come with a standard 0.065-inch single line that rotates to make a 13-inch cutting diameter. The line auto feeds from the head. If you&#39;re used to using a Bump and Feed head, be careful to not accidentally tap the head of this electric string trimmer on the ground because it can crack the casing and ruin the advancing mechanism.","The last thing you want when you&#39;re trimming is to accidentally cut things you wanted to preserve. You want to show off the daisies, not behead them. That&#39;s why it&#39;s nice to have an edge guard, which comes standard with this Homelite electric trimmer. One thing it doesn&#39;t come with that we wish it did is a safety switch. Not many electric string trimmers have this feature, but it&#39;s a nice one to have.","The pole on this electric weed trimmer adjusts to better fit your height. It can compact down to 36 inches and lengthen out 39 inches, which is 3 and 3.25 feet respectively. Although you can lengthen the pole, it&#39;s not by much, especially when you consider that most of the electric string trimmers we reviewed are at least 3.5 feet at their shortest. In addition to lengthening the pole on the Homelite electric trimmers, you can also rotate it. By doing this, it converts the trimmer into an edger."]},"id":"08e86344-ab03-42d3-9a7a-5646652b8089","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"String Features"},"id":"addb5101-684f-442a-9332-00dd1d565b5a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You&#39;ll need a Phillips Screwdriver to assemble the grass deflector.
