You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The iMac is the archetypal all-in-one PC, and it continues to be one of the best all-in-one computers money can buy. The iMac is an example of what every all-in-one computer should be: powerful, professional, flexible and well designed. For this all-in-one computer review, we focus on the 21.5-inch i5 Core iMac.","There are features of the Apple iMac that are inherently better than all-in-one PCs. The physical design is unrivaled. The innovative Magic Mouse and ultra-thin keyboard are amazing. And the 21.5-inch HD widescreen LED-backlit monitor has IPS (in-plane switching) technology that provides a great view from any angle.","There are also factors that may be deal-breakers for some. The wireless keyboard is thin, but it doesn’t have a numeric pad. The glossy edge-to-edge glass is impressive but does reflect a considerable screen glare. The iMac is noticeably missing a Blu-ray drive, eSATA port and HDMI connectivity.","But for the most part, rather than features and functions that are patently better or worse than other all-in-one PCs, the iMac has characteristics that are just different. For example, Apple has reserved touchscreens for the iPhone and iPad. But while the monitor isn’t a touchscreen, there is touch interaction in the (arguably better implemented) Magic Trackpad and Magic Mouse. The Macintosh operating system is significantly different than Windows. And while we won’t make a blanket statement about one operating system always being better than the other, the Mac OS rocks for professional graphics applications.","The design of the iMac in an undisputed success, combining style and function in a design that is simple and aesthetic. The 21.5-inch glass monitor is encased by a solid aluminum back panel and supported by a thin aluminum pedestal. But as eye-catching as the iMac is, it’s what’s inside that takes the all-in-one computer from art to state-of-the-art.","The newest incarnations of 21.5-inch Apple iMacs come fully equipped with the Intel Core i5 processor. The 8GB of RAM and 500GB hard drive are nothing to sneer at, but they can be upgraded to 16GB and 2TB, respectively. With that amount of memory, storage and processing power, it’s no wonder the iMac is the preferred all-in-one desktop computer for video editing and graphics.","The iMac’s optical drive doesn’t support Blu-ray, but it is otherwise comprehensive. The slot-loading 8x SuperDrive reads and writes all types of DVDs (including dual layer) with speed and precision. A built-in SDXC card reader, FireWire port and four USB 2.0 ports make peripheral connections a snap.","Hooking up to the internet is also easy, with the obligatory Gigabit Ethernet port and 802.11a/b/g wireless. The iMac also features AirPort Extreme 802.11n Wi-Fi connectivity. You can connect to another monitor with the Mini DisplayPort (output only). With the right connector you can use the DisplayPort for VGA and DVI, but what we really notice is the lack of an HDMI port.","The iSight camera is discreetly hidden at the top of the monitor. It’s a 0.3 megapixel webcam for iChat web conferencing or Photo Booth pictures. The standard bundled peripherals are the ultrathin wireless keyboard and Magic Mouse. The keyboard has isolated white keys on an aluminum body. The Magic Mouse is the innovative multi-touch, button-less iMac mouse. Both connect wirelessly via Bluetooth, complement the iMac design and further add to the overall Mac experience.","The Apple brand is set on making products that are intuitive, but you may still need some help along the way. Video tutorials, user guides and forums are all accessible on Apple.com. For further assistance you can get in touch with support via phone (though not email or live chat)."]},"id":"f76e04c5-12c3-4cd4-8fb5-0fe1eecc1966","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"883fc7b6-47f0-4ef3-b8f5-b2806f336542","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The 21.5-inch Intel i5 iMac continues the Apple iMac legacy of quality and innovation.
