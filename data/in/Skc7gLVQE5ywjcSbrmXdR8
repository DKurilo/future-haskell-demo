The Gourmet T-47D is relatively small, weighing in at around 130 pounds, but its grilling area is contrastingly generous at around 580 square inches of grill space on the main burner, with 200 square inches of warming area.","The T-47D has enough power to heat quickly and stay hot. The primary burners generate up to 37,000 BTUs, with the side burners generating another 13,000 BTUs. This means your steaks will cook from the inside out keeping moisture in and tasting as good as those you order from your favorite steakhouse.","The Char-Broil Gourmet BBQ grill uses gas, though you can purchase a conversion kit and use natural gas, too. As its name implies, it also comes equipped with an infrared burner. The knobs on the control panel are lighted for easy night grilling. This outdoor grill has a temperature gauge, warming rack and side tables. The best feature in terms of extras are the infrared grates, which will help you grill nice, evenly cooked meat. This grill lacks certain extras like a smoker box and a rotisserie rack, which some of the best gas grills offer, but they can be purchased separately.","The Gourmet grill will have to be assembled out of the box. Char-Broil offers some great support options in case you need help. In addition to direct support through phone and email, you can search the FAQs section or browse through an electronic version of the user guide. Char-Broil also offers a live chat option, which is rare among gas grill manufacturers. The warranty for this grill is way below that of most of the competition, with only a one-year warranty for both parts and the main burners."]},"id":"d12fd4a3-154c-48d3-b802-38cd07286e4e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c59824db-dc3f-4dfe-843a-4ca046cf572b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Char-Broil Gourmet grill has plenty of power to cook your meat the way you like it.
