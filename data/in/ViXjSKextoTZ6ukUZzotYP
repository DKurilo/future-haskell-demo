The Safari extension was easy to locate and turn on, but the Chrome extension required us to first download it from the Chrome Web Store. Installing the extension was a bit complicated, though Kaspersky walked us through it. It wasn’t difficult per se, just a lot of steps, especially compared to its Windows program that automatically installs browser extensions for you.","As we navigated the web, we learned Kaspersky recognizes Windows threats, too, and stops malicious downloads from installing malware on your Mac computer. While these threats won’t hurt your system, they can accidentally be passed along to a PC user. The only threat Kaspersky seemed to have trouble with was malicious websites known to have malware downloads on them. However, Kaspersky only had trouble recognizing them when we tried to access them through Chrome.

And Mac has webcam protections that monitor your computer and block applications trying to access or enable your web browser without your permission.","There are a few tools missing from Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac.
