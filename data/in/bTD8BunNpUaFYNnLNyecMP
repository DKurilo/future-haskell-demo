From VHS, to DVD and Blu-ray, the medium always changes. With a media player, you don&#39;t need to worry about a physical medium. Instead, you can easily appreciate the beauty and convenience of streaming video and music into your living room. Services like Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Pandora and Hulu Plus bring instant entertainment to your whole family without the hassle of maintaining a physical library of content.","The best media players don&#39;t simply stream entertainment into your home – they also allow you to organize and access your own media library using the same interface. You can watch home movies, listen to music and view photos from a compatible computer, smartphone, eReader or other device.","Many digital media servers, such as the Sony PlayStation, have internal storage so you can download and save content onto the unit&#39;s hard drive to access anytime you want. The PlayStation also allows for hard drive expansion, so you&#39;ll never run out of space.","Home media servers function as the hub of your digital entertainment world, giving you the ability to pull up a piece of entertainment in seconds from various digital sources. Want to catch up on your favorite show? Want to rent the latest blockbuster movie? Most home media servers give you the capability to do that quickly.","Many media streamers come with user-friendly interfaces or a remote that has a QWERTY keypad, which makes finding the content you&#39;re looking for quick and easy. You don&#39;t want to waste time or energy fighting non-user-friendly software, so it&#39;s an important consideration.","You can also use these multi-functional media devices for video sharing from YouTube, streaming music from Pandora and Spotify or sharing photos from your family vacation via Flickr and Facebook on your HDTV.

Additionally, many allow you to rent movies or television episodes through dedicated online stores such as the Apple Store, Google Play or the PlayStation Store. Some can also be networked with your personal computer to play your personal digital media through your home entertainment center.","Some media players are better suited for specific tasks than others. If you&#39;re mostly interested in streaming online content, look for a player with a vast selection of apps. However, if you already own a large digital media library, you&#39;d be well served by a home media server that can access content from your computer&#39;s hard drive.","The best home media server will be different for everybody, because everyone&#39;s preferences vary. There&#39;s a wide variety of products to choose from. However, there are some general features and issues to look for, explained in depth below.","<strong>Video &amp; Sound Quality</strong><br/>It is important to know what kind of video and sound quality the player can support. At the very least, the player should support standard definition (SD) quality, although that&#39;s quickly becoming unbearable in our high definition (HD)-centric world. HD compatibility is important if you plan to play content on an HDTV.","Look for a resolution of 720p or 1080p, depending on what your TV supports. Most units now support 1080p, but 720p is excellent video quality. 4K resolution is gaining traction and should also be a consideration.","Audio should be stereo surround sound and have a high bit rate. After all, audio often comprise a large part of any movie or TV show. And you&#39;ll want to hear your song playlists at the highest-possible fidelity. As media player technology advances, the quality of the streaming will continue to improve, and you&#39;ll want a device that supports the best video and sound quality available.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>Setting up your home media streamer is generally quite simple, but if there&#39;s a problem, or if you have questions about ways to get the most out of the device you&#39;ve chosen, the type of tech support available to you is important. Look for manufacturers that offer multiple support options, including phone and email support, live chat, user forums, FAQs or a knowledgebase, and a user manual.","Once a home media server is connected to your entertainment center, you can access a whole new dimension of home entertainment. Imagine streaming the latest movies right to your television, accessing photos from last summer&#39;s beach vacation on your HDTV or listening to your own music playlists through a surround sound system. With a home media server, your possibilities are nearly endless.","<strong>Similar Products</strong>","Don&#39;t need a full media player? You can still access online movies and music through simple streaming devices like the Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV Stick. There&#39;s not much to these devices – a power port and an HDMI connection. Just plug one into an HDMI port on your TV, and you&#39;re most of the way there to digitally streaming Netflix to your TV.","Initial setup of these devices is easy. Just connect them to your home&#39;s Wi-Fi. Then connect your smartphone, tablet or computer to the streaming device, pick the content you want to experience, and it will play on your TV. Pretty slick.","There is a host of streaming sticks to choose from, including one from Roku, but there are others. All of them are relatively inexpensive, providing you with a low-cost entry into digital streaming. These are a solution if you don&#39;t have a smart TV but still want access to Netflix, Hulu or other streaming services on your big screen.","Some of these streaming devices have access to online stores, allowing you to rent or buy entertainment. But a few of them are very simple and only act as a way to connect your smarter devices to your TV.","Once a home media server is connected to your entertainment center, you can access a whole new dimension of home entertainment. Be sure to read each of the featured products in our buying guide to help you find the home media server best suited for your purposes and needs."]},"id":"2861d6b8-0390-4d98-9525-fc64f237d594","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"44b18708-e2ac-4d56-b0ed-4a8e6133fbfc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://aos.prf.hn/click/camref:1011l8gN/destination:http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-tv%2Fapple-tv\">Apple TV</a>","<a href=\"https://www.elvessupply.com/D-Link-DSM-380-Boxee-Box-Hd-Media-Player-Hdmi-Usb-80211N_p_338332.html?gclid=CMzcjMr2xs8CFZM8gQod9x4LJQ\">Boxee</a>","<a href=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=50e01c1932669308687444846f8526fb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCisco-Linksys-NMH405-Media-Hub-Home-Entertainment-Storage-with-LCD-Retail%2F11997592\">Linksys</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AM0ESC4/?&tag=ttr_home_media_servers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|536[art|NA[pid|56015[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Netgear NeoTV</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BGA9WK2/?&tag=ttr_home_media_servers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|536[art|NA[pid|52868[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">PlayStation</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UJ3IULO?tag=ttr_home_media_servers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|536[art|NA[pid|49755[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Roku</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JXFM75Y/?&tag=ttr_home_media_servers-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|536[art|NA[pid|49753[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">WD TV Play</a>","<a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-3970864-11517614-1435800121000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FProduct.aspx%3FItem%3D9SIA3782D44349%26nm_mc%3DAFC-C8Junction-MKPL%26cm_mmc%3DAFC-C8Junction-MKPL-_-Xbox%2BOne%2BSystem-_-Microsoft-_-9SIA3782D44349&cjsku=9SIA3782D44349\">Xbox One</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"64bb0f27-c9c4-47b7-b442-ec4a36ec8a04","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_536","url":"/best-home-media-servers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-06-08T16:19:48Z","datePublished":"2016-10-10T16:12:42Z","name":"Home Media Servers Review","synopsis":"Home Media Servers make it easier to buy and rent movies or TV shows, access internet video, radio and photo websites and playback personal digital content.","review":{},"strapline":"Home Media Servers make it easier to buy and rent movies or TV shows, access internet video, radio and photo websites and playback personal digital content.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-12-13T00:13:30Z","id":"bTD8BunNpUaFYNnLNyecMP","meta":{"title":"The Best Home Media Servers 2018 - Top Ten Reviews","description":"Which is the best home media server for you?
