If the grill produces high temperatures but can’t maintain them consistently, you have to keep the flames burning on high, which usually results in the outside of your meat cooking too long and drying out. Fortunately, the Weber Genesis II E-310&#39;s heat consistency alleviates this potential problem.","The Weber Genesis II E-310 has three stainless steel primary burners that cook evenly and efficiently with a total of 37,500 Btu of heat. The grill takes around eight minutes to reach a preheat temperature of 500 degrees, but because of its construction, it maintains a high temperature using less fuel than other grills. The Genesis II E-310 does not include a rear burner for rotisserie cooking or a side burner for cooking your toppings while you grill burgers or steaks.","Weber offers a Genesis II model specifically designed to work with your natural gas connection, if you have one. The company does not sell a conversion kit for the Genesis II product line, so you can&#39;t convert this propane gas grill to a natural gas grill without buying a new one if you change your mind in the future. Natural gas can save you money in the long run, but the location of your connection limits where you can place your grill."]},"id":"51c6968c-2b5a-49c6-a87b-14b2b4278e91","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"2c43b976-dcb9-45e5-929a-ae63b8bcca65","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/Uck7QdS2oopZEY6hrjZbSf.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/52633-weber-genesis-e-33024.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uck7QdS2oopZEY6hrjZbSf.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Uck7QdS2oopZEY6hrjZbSf","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uck7QdS2oopZEY6hrjZbSf.jpg","alt":""},"id":"a187aee1-3b79-45a5-a4db-fa897df38de9","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The primary grilling area of the Genesis II E-310 consists of two porcelain-coated, cast-iron grates with a total 513 square inches of grilling space. In our testing, we found this to be enough room to place up to 24 uncooked 4-inch hamburger patties side by side. This is a large grilling area for a three-burner model and is one of the reasons the E-310 is our pick for the best barbecue grill.","The Genesis II E-310&#39;s deep grate saves space on your porch or deck and still allows you to cook a lot of food. When it&#39;s not covered with burgers, this grill can handle a sizable rack of ribs or a fair-size brisket, although you may need to cut the ribs into two half racks to fit them comfortably if they are very long.","The only disappointment is that the warming rack only holds around six uncooked 4-inch burgers. Grills such as the <a href=\"/char-broil-review\">Char-Broil Stainless</a> can hold up to 10 burgers. It would be nice to have a larger warming rack, but the reduced size allows you to reach the middle and back rows of the grill more easily, so it&#39;s a good trade-off. Additionally, the warming rack sits 6 inches above the primary cooking grates, so you can flip food over with a spatula without hitting it against the warming rack. You can also fold the rack out of the way when you don&#39;t need it.","Grilling on the Genesis II E-310 is enjoyable. The wide surface area allows you to cook multiple food items, and being able to reach each portion without navigating around a low-hanging warming rack is a pleasant change."]},"id":"2921add5-1ae1-4602-a69c-2a0396b50ecc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Heating"},"id":"dd9eebbb-2855-4524-a4cc-b097217b056e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/4QerouwXydZrnqnLNgAgnd.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/52633-weber-genesis-e-33022.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QerouwXydZrnqnLNgAgnd.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"4QerouwXydZrnqnLNgAgnd","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QerouwXydZrnqnLNgAgnd.jpg","alt":""},"id":"6a657888-de30-4edb-981c-29621069c471","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This stainless steel gas grill is sturdily built, with a thick-gauge steel used in the firebox. The hood is covered with porcelain, which boosts the grill’s heat retention. The E-310 does not feel flimsy at all – the side shelves are sturdy, and there are three accessory hooks on each side for your grilling tools.","The primary cooking grates are made of cast iron and coated with a porcelain enamel. They are wider than the traditional round bars on stainless steel grates. This design gives you wide, attractive sear marks on your food, and the narrow spaces between the bars decreases the chance of losing a burger between them. These cast-iron grates retain heat more efficiently and longer than a stainless steel grate, making this grill a better choice for slow cooking.","Weber offers a rotisserie kit for purchase that is compatible with the Genesis II E-310. When you use this kit, you do not have to ignite the center burner; rather, you use the left and right burners for indirect heat. This keeps your chicken juicy while cooking it to the appropriate temperature.","The E-310 only has two swiveling casters, so it can take a little work to move your grill back and forth like a handcart to get it in the right position.
