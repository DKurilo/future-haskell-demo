Placing orders is simple, and your commission rate is always listed on the order screen, so you can know what you’re paying to the brokerage as you make trades.","Creating alerts is not as intuitive as it is with other platforms; you cannot set up alerts from a watchlist or by clicking on the symbol as with other platforms. You can create alerts for multiple conditions, such as price, time or the percent of change. One standout feature of Trader Workstation is the ability to set up alerts that trigger trades. You can set up the platform to execute a trade when a currency pair hits a certain price, something that can save you time and give you an edge when trading something as volatile as forex.","Interactive Brokers offers a wide array of charting tools, including over 90 technical indicators. These allow you to gauge the performance of a currency pairing and use that information to plan your forex trading strategies. You can’t compare different symbols, but you can compare a symbol’s performance with the performance of an index, which can tell you whether it is under-performing or out-performing a particular market.","A mobile app version of Trader Workstation is also available. This app wasn’t as strong as some of the other apps we tested. Its main flaw is that you cannot add funds to your account through the app, something the majority of apps we tested allow you to do. The app also makes it hard to set up alerts as you can’t create them from a watchlist and you’ll need to search for the particular symbol. The app does make all of Interactive Broker’s technical indicator’s available, something that not all mobile apps do.","You can trade 22 different currency pairs through Interactive Brokers.
