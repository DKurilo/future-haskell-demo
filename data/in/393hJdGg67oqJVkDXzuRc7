If youâ€™re looking for a curved stairlift, check out the Handicare 2000.","The standard Handicare 1000 seat is padded and available in six colors, though it is not the most comfortable or stylish stairlift seat available. A manually swiveling seat and manually folded footrest come standard, though you can upgrade to a power-swivel seat and power footrest. Handicare also offers a perch-style seating option for people with limited mobility who are more comfortable in a nearly standing position, as well as a body harness for those who need extra support as they ride.","With the standard seat option, the 1000 has a <a href=\"http://101mobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Handicare-1000-Stairlift-HC-BRO-0011-web.pdf\">maximum weight capacity of 350 pounds</a>, but if you opt for the perch-style seat the lift will only accommodate up to 300 pounds. You can upgrade to the 440-pound capacity of the Handicare 1000XXL if needed.","The outdoor model of the 1000 is a UV-protected, weatherproof stairlift that comes with a waterproof cover.","Handicare gives you the option of having a manual or powered hinge on the track that folds to make more room at the base of the stairs and avoid obstructing a doorway. While the powered option is convenient, the chance that the motorized hinge will eventually need repairs is greater than with the manual option.","Like most stairlifts, the Handicare 1000 has rechargeable 24-volt batteries that keep the carriage moving during power outages. There are charging stations at the top and bottom of the stairs. Stairlifts with charge strips along their rails, such as the Bruno Elite, will charge the batteries faster than the Handicare stairlift.","The Handicare 1000 may pack fewer features than some premium stairlifts, but it has all the essential safety features required of one. It comes with a retractable seat belt, a key switch to prevent unauthorized use and sensors that prevent the carriage from running into obstructions. There is also an easy-to-use toggle at the end of one arm for operating the carriage and two remote controls for sending the stairlift up or down the stairs.","The Handicare 1000 comes with a <a href=\"https://www.handicare.com/media/270343/handicare_warranty_en.pdf\">two-year warranty</a> on parts and a lifetime warranty on the gearbox and motor."]},"id":"33fb1353-50e4-487b-a86f-8b4a307951c2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60662","url":"/handicare-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sheryl-huggins-salomon","url":"/author/sheryl-huggins-salomon","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Sheryl Huggins Salomon","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"PEDnkfQBmpWyHpYTiEznSY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-01T20:39:43Z","datePublished":"2014-10-01T20:39:43Z","name":"Handicare 1000","synopsis":"Handicare's 1000 is an affordable, no-frills straight stairlift with optional add-ons that accommodate outdoor use, heavier people and those with limited mobility.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Handicare's 1000 is an affordable, no-frills straight stairlift with optional add-ons that accommodate outdoor use, heavier people and those with limited mobility.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-03T00:00:00Z","id":"393hJdGg67oqJVkDXzuRc7","meta":{"title":"Handicare 1000 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Handicare 1000 stairlift is a good fit for homes with narrow or steep stairways because it is slim and sturdy.
