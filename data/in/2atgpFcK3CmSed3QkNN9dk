Not only does the Kaito KA888 include multiple options for charging, but it also has some fabulous emergency features including a siren and a tuner to pick up two short wave radio bands. While it isn’t as durable as it could be, we were pleased with the compact size. This crank radio is definitely one to look into, especially if you want a radio with alternative power source options."]},"id":"4db8a2ff-a5f5-42a2-8848-0f5fc7fdaa40","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Pricing"},"id":"51ff90d7-c015-4a1c-8f3d-f4ba3146b229","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The charging time for this crank radio is fairly good. By cranking for two minutes you can have an hour of play time. It is also one of the smaller crank radios we reviewed, which is useful if you have only a limited amount of space. The handle of the crank is a little smaller than we would have liked, but since this is a compact product – measuring 19.5 cm x 10 cm x 6 cm – the small handle wasn&#39;t too bothersome. We would have liked a rubber grip on the end of the handle for comfort and an easier grip.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"b9b43939-90be-4364-9ff7-43ad4c27b9bf","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This crank radio has several unique features, including a compass and a thermometer. Having a compass available is valuable whether you are in the great outdoors or trying to find your way around after a disaster. The compass is located on the top of the unit as is about as large as a nickel. While the compass is a little on the small side, it&#39;s easy to read and proved useful in our testing. The thermometer on the front of the crank radio is another handy tool. You just have to take into account that the reading may be a little off because of heat radiating from the case.","This crank radio also features a clock, an alarm and a siren. The clock is located on the front of the unit, underneath the tuner. While this is fairly easy to set, the fact that the clock is not illuminated makes it difficult to read in the dark, and turning on the flashlight doesn’t help with this problem. We didn’t have any problem setting the alarm, but we worried that if the batteries ran down, it would prove pointless. However, as long as the unit is fully charged before you head to bed, battery life shouldn’t be a problem. The siren is one of the best features this product has. It is fairly loud and is likely to catch anyone’s attention in the area if you happen to need help."]},"id":"87648cec-aa43-4c19-9fce-cb76c70a1d1b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Power"},"id":"ab181f4d-dffb-4d95-8bfc-04d8594de83a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This product doesn’t have as much going for it when it comes to its ruggedness.

The first way is by hand crank. The second way is to set the solar wind up radio in the sun and use the solar panel on top. With 12 hours of sunlight you can play the wind up radio for up to eight hours. The third way to charge the crank radio is using the included AC/DC adapter. This is a great way to initially charge the unit and then use the sunlight and crank to keep it going. After leaving it plugged in for six hours you can get up to 48 hours of play time. The last way to power the crank radio is using three AA batteries. We appreciate the fact that it can be powered by AA batteries because it means we don’t have to wait for it to charge in order to use the radio or any of the features."]},"id":"659c4f58-eb1c-4b58-b1cb-ae7dae675bbd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Emergency Features"},"id":"44045e0d-8a9e-4142-b991-0a9e8693d75f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The support offered for this crank radio is limited.
