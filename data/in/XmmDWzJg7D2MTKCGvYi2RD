It does this by allowing you to save a DVD’s ISO file (disc image) or DVD folder directly to your hard drive. These files are digital blueprints of your DVD, complete with menus and special features. Once the file&#39;s on your hard drive, you can use it as a virtual disc in your computer’s DVD player software. You can also burn it to a new disc without needing the original. So, if you ever happen to lose or break your movies, you can use DVDFab to burn a new copy from the ISO file or DVD folder.","Almost all commercial DVDs are copy protected, meaning that they have anti-piracy encryptions.
