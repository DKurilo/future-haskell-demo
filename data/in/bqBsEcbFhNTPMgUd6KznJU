You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","The Garmin Nuvi 205 could be a smart choice for someone looking for an entry level Personal Navigation Device. It’s easy to use and like other Garmin devices the touchscreen is responsive and easy to understand so first time GPS users should find it appealing.","The Nuvi 205 features a 3.5-inch diagonal measure touchscreen with 320 x 240 pixel resolution. The 205 is essentially a replacement for the successful Nuvi 200 but the last digit “5” designates it has having real time traffic capability which is fairly uncommon at this level. If you want to take advantage of this functionality, however, you have to purchase an optional receiver and subscribe to the data service. It also has a more convenient and informative user interface compared to its predecessor.","Extreme portability is a plus for this unit. It’s small enough that you could pop it off of the windshield and into your shirt pocket without difficulty. The diminutive size is also what limits the screen size but it’s still of adequate size for most users despite input being a little cramped. A security feature shared with other Garmin devices is called “Where Am I?” I allows you to pinpoint your current location and indicates the nearest address, intersection, and emergency services.","There are always feature compromises with budget friendly devices and the one that we miss most on the Nuvi 205 is text to speech capability. The device still gives audible turn by turn directions but in generic terms such as “Turn left in 50 feet.” If you want to know the proper street name where you’ll be turning, you have to glance at the screen for it which might not be a great idea in traffic. Text to speech would give more specific directions such as “Turn left on Simpson Street.”","This device comes preloaded with maps of the contiguous United States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. In addition to its navigation features, it has a trip computer, a JPEG photo viewer and a calculator with currency and measurement converters.<br/> "]},"id":"eb0511c7-5a63-44a2-8b61-d08b07803b5f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_44965","url":"/garmin-nuvi-205-45796-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-03-27T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-03-27T06:00:00Z","name":"Garmin Nuvi 205 Nuvi 205","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":28,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-03-27T17:23:55Z","id":"bqBsEcbFhNTPMgUd6KznJU","meta":{"title":"Garmin Nuvi 205 Nuvi 205 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Take a look at one of our top picks for the best navigation GPS systems, the Garmin Nuvi 205."},"products":[{"slug":"garmin-nuvi-205-nuvi-205","url":"/product/garmin-nuvi-205-nuvi-205","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:16:33Z","name":"Garmin Nuvi 205 Nuvi 205","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:16:33Z","id":"RAXf69e43A8wgohoEpSCQ3","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:16:33Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/dbJ6rTwpkAEragp8JYBka9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:16:33Z","mimeType":"","name":"ce45796.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/ce45796.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:16:33Z","id":"dbJ6rTwpkAEragp8JYBka9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbJ6rTwpkAEragp8JYBka9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Garmin Nuvi 205 Nuvi 205 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Take a look at one of our top picks for the best navigation GPS systems, the Garmin Nuvi 205."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/dbJ6rTwpkAEragp8JYBka9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:16:33Z","mimeType":"","name":"ce45796.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/ce45796.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:16:33Z","id":"dbJ6rTwpkAEragp8JYBka9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbJ6rTwpkAEragp8JYBka9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Garmin Nuvi 205 Nuvi 205 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Take a look at one of our top picks for the best navigation GPS systems, the Garmin Nuvi 205."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/gps/best-navigation-gps/garmin-nuvi-205-45796-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:16:33Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:16:33Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gps","url":"/electronics/gps","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:16:33Z","name":"GPS","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:16:33Z","id":"PaNWioUkFhvsXZKxXS5PLR","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
