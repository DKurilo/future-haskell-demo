With a storage capacity of 4,000 photos and two-day battery life, it is a good <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-action-cameras,review-3046.html\">life camera</a>. However, with no video function and limited 8GB storage, its uses are limited.","The 5MP camera on the Narrative Clip body cam allows it to store up to 4,000 photos, but you cannot print any of them. The image quality is low enough that the photos are only good for viewing on a computer, phone or tablet. This is fine for creating a visual record of your day, but it&#39;s not suitable for many other uses.","Because the camera automatically takes two photos per minute, you cannot turn it off or choose what to take a picture of. Instead, you clip the device onto your belt, collar or a tie and allow it to snap photos from your point of view. With two photos per minute, you get a good record of almost every part of your day.","The two-day battery allows you to wear the camera for a long period of time, but the limited storage space means that it can&#39;t run continuously for longer than 33 hours. When the battery is empty, you can plug the Narrative into your computer to download your photos and charge the unit. Once synced, all of your photos upload to the Narrative Cloud, where you can access them from any computer with an internet connection. You can also share them with friends and family.","Available apps for Android and iOS phones allow you to access your photos from the Cloud after uploading them. At 20 grams in weight, the body camera is light enough to sit easily on a collar or pocket without causing discomfort. The small size of 1.42 inches square by 0.35 inches thick allows you to hide it on your person if desired.","With a low-quality camera and no way to take specific photos, the Narrative Clip has limited functionality. However, it does allow you to create a life journal comprised of photos of your entire day. If you want a life camera, then the Narrative Clip is a good option, but it is not suitable for much else."]},"id":"9d6ea8ef-90eb-4731-857f-362e59ac75c9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64256","url":"/narrative-clip-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-21T19:27:49Z","datePublished":"2015-04-21T19:27:49Z","name":"Narrative Clip","synopsis":"The Narrative Clip features a 5MP camera that automatically snaps two photos per minute.
