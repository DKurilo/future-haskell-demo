The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-car-battery-chargers\">Car Battery Chargers</a> here.</em>","The Battery Tender Plus from Deltran is a compact car battery charger that is perfect for owners of rarely driven vehicles such as classic show cars, ATVs and golf carts. While it doesn&#39;t have as much power as our top-ranked auto battery boosters, this battery charger can slowly charge and maintain 12V and 6V batteries with ease.","This battery booster has a microprocessor unit that assesses the state your battery is in and begins charging in the correct mode automatically. This is a nice feature as you can essentially &#34;connect and forget&#34; your battery. You don&#39;t have to worry about overcharging your battery as the Battery Tender Plus microprocessor controls automatically shut off when your battery reaches full its full charge.","If you leave your battery hooked up, this car battery booster enters into a float-voltage mode. This mode will continuously monitor and maintain the voltage on your battery for as long as you have your battery connected, guaranteeing you will have a properly charged battery when you need it. Deltran provides a generous, limited 10-year warranty against manufacturer defects, which far exceeds the average warranty length of the other chargers on our lineup.","The biggest downfall of the Battery Tender Plus is that you cannot select a fast-charge method, keeping you at the mercy of the 1.5 amp slow-charge rate. While this won&#39;t be a problem if you have a battery you want to keep connected through the off-season, it makes the Battery Tender Plus a less-than-suitable car battery charger for owners who need a quick charge or jump-start.","This battery charger has some good safety features, including spark-proof clamps and reverse-polarity protection. The reverse-polarity protection is an essential safety feature that keeps the unit from starting a charge if it detects you have placed the clamps on the wrong battery terminals. Trying to charge a battery with the incorrect cable connection will ruin your battery and could result in overheating or an explosion."]},"id":"4894f169-df58-4e2b-a899-6caa9c2abc9a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"708cfb59-b6d6-4dac-80f6-a4f2f1813886","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While it doesn&#39;t have all the features found in the best car battery chargers, the Battery Tender Plus is a great, little charger if you own vehicles that do not get driven very often.
