You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","CinemaNow started up in 1999 as a digital movie service. While it has managed to compete with major brands, its acquisition by Best Buy has made it a strong competitor as an <a href=\"/best-internet-tv-sites\">internet TV service</a>. Not does it offer the purchase of pay-per-view movies, but you can also catch up on the latest episodes from nearly every network.","To stream TV online through CinemaNow, you must sign up for an account, but it requires no monthly fee. Much like its movie service, you must purchase each television episode. The price for standard definition sits at $1.99 per episode, with the option of HD for a dollar more. A great factor of this site is the number of ways you can access your library of purchased shows. You can watch downloads on game consoles, tablets, smart TVs and your computer.","CinemaNow’s focus on its streaming TV library has improved its entire service. With the ability to download early episodes of your current favorite shows, you can start from the beginning and eventually catch up to current episodes. However, because each episode costs money, your wallet will take a hit for using this service as your only way to watch internet TV. CinemaNow works better as a supplemental way to catch up on a high-profile episode that you missed.","The personal profile section leaves much to be desired. Your options of control include choosing what streaming TV shows you&#39;d like to keep in your library and what parental controls you&#39;d like to set. The controls essentially manage what shows can be purchased based on MPAA ratings, just in case your children use your account.","CinemaNow is limited when it comes to support. You can only contact the service through email messaging. Without more immediate forms of communication, such as live chat or phone, it may take days for your questions to be answered. However, the website does have a FAQs page which may provide the solutions to your problem."]},"id":"5eb45ee2-e319-4c77-aa5c-ef9e44f3a4b9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"eae14b29-ddb2-492f-80e8-7be5d7712d41","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["CinemaNow may not be the best internet TV service, but it is a great resource as a supplement to another streaming service.
