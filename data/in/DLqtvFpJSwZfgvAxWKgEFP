However, the <a href=\"/best-driver-update-software\">driver update software</a> never returned thorough scan results in our tests, and it isn’t the easiest software to use. The program is also missing a few features that would make it more comprehensive and easier to use.","Auslogics Driver Updater is one of the more capable programs we reviewed. Out of the 149 outdated drivers we installed on our test PC, it identified 75. By comparison, only two other applications fared better. That said, even the best performing app, <a href=\"/software/utilities/best-driver-update-software/driver-booster-review/\">Driver Booster</a>, only detected 91 drivers, so none of the products we tested were particularly stellar. On a positive note, when you click on existing and new drivers, Auslogics Driver Updater displays information about their sources and version details.","Although the program more or less does what it advertises it can do, it’s not very easy to use. Unlike the best driver update software we reviewed, Auslogics Driver Updater makes you open and install all updates by yourself; it doesn’t do it automatically, though it does download the updates for you with one click. You can also schedule scans to run periodically. If you’re worried about an update not installing correctly, you can use the program to create a backup of your system’s drivers, so you can restore them if necessary.","We were happy to see that Auslogics Driver Updater didn’t download malware or bloatware onto our test computer. However, the software contains ads for the developer’s other utilities – the ads insist that when you use all the company’s programs together, you’re ensured “continuously fast and stable PC performance.” There is even a dedicated tab within the driver updater program that lists these other recommended applications, and a final pop-up appears when you try to uninstall the program. Given that this is the most expensive driver updater we reviewed, we weren’t happy to see these ads.","The software’s manufacturer, Auslogics Labs Pty Limited, provides only a few technical support options. You can get one-on-one help over email, though naturally there is a wait to receive a reply. There is also a scant FAQs section on the company’s website that may answer some questions you have.","Auslogics Driver Updater gives you a general idea of what drivers on your computer are out of date and lets you backup and restore them. However, its lack of an uninstall option or OEM guarantee makes it less than ideal, as do its annoying upsell and pop-up ads."]},"id":"77a4bb1f-1ceb-47f6-b4e5-327c6ca8514d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70262","url":"/auslogics-driver-updater-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-27T12:24:51Z","datePublished":"2018-09-27T12:24:51Z","name":"Auslogics Driver Updater","synopsis":"Auslogics Driver Updater can scan your computer and help you install some correct driver updates.
