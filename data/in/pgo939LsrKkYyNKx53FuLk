This drone can capture 1080p high-definition video and 2-megapixel stills.","The stabilization gimbal ensures your video comes out clear and free from shakiness. You can use the camera to get a glimpse of a real-time view of what your drone sees while you are flying it. Not only are the camera and gimbal pre-installed, you also get a built-in GPS. The drone has a return-to-home feature, allowing the drone fly back to you if it goes out of range. It also has an automatic landing feature in case something goes awry, like bad weather or you lose sight of the UAV.","The battery life of this drone is around 10-15 minutes, which is about average. The best drones have a battery life of 25 minutes. The drone has a solid build. It is 18 inches long and wide. It weighs just 2 pounds and can hold a payload of about 9 ounces.","This personal drone is very easy to fly and has four different flight modes. Smart Mode makes it so you don&#39;t have to be aware of the drone&#39;s orientation. In Stability Mode, you can tilt the quad faster. Aerial Photography Mode puts the drone in a locked position, keeping it steady for image and video capturing. Lastly, Altitude Hold is just what it sounds like, the drone maintains a steady altitude.","This drone is entirely ready to fly, and a 3000mAh rechargeable LiPo battery is included along with a transmitter and four AA batteries. All you need to add is a MicroSD card to store images and video. You get a 30-day warranty; however, this doesn’t cover any accidental damages or repairs if you happen to crash your drone or break a propeller. Fortunately, this drone comes with an extra set up propellers, so you can replace any broken ones.","You will be able to easily find the instruction manual in full on Blade’s website. Blade also has some tutorial videos for flight tips and directions on how to set up your drone. If you need further support, you can reach Blade by telephone or email."]},"id":"031f5e90-9b99-4f07-a216-3d19dbb2eb59","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"43d45619-e3df-4d7e-bdda-2b9cd6cf570b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Blade 350 QX2 is a good choice for beginners or for aerial photography enthusiasts.
