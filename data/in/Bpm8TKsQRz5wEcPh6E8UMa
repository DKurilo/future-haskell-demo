The model we chose to review for this site is Mitsubishi&#39;s 55-inch Unisen <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TV</a><em>.</em> Initially, we were impressed with the look and feel of the Mitsubishi LT-55265, and through our testing and several user reviews, it appeared to be one of the top contenders on our matrix. However, under closer scrutiny, the specifications of this LED-backlit TV came up short against the competition. The obnoxiously thick display panel, lack of local dimming and disappointing absence of several connector types hurt this set in our rankings, although its above-average refresh rate, impressive contrast ratio and bank of 18 separate speakers in the bezel saved it from the lower echelons of this comparison."]},"id":"61105306-22a0-4fc4-9d2b-89de32d9fb0c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Display"},"id":"c6d95657-818b-4427-9cd8-9815a939fbbd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/HyWEfmJ58ZqDUdsRXo48PQ.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The best feature of the Mitsubishi LT-55265 is its large 55-inch screen and incredible arrangement of pseudo surround-sound speakers in the screen bezel.

There are a total of 18 powered speakers embedded in the bezel, which is a number that is orders of magnitude greater than any other LED-backlit TV that we have ever seen.
