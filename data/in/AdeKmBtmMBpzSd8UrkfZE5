It&#39;s exceptionally easy to use, and it prints high-quality documents.","You can wirelessly send print jobs to the XP-410 several different ways. The most common way is to connect the printer to your home or office wireless network. The printer then shows up on the list of available devices you can print from. Setting this up takes a few minutes, and instructions are included with the printer.","The XP-410 is also compatible with AirPrint, Apple&#39;s proprietary print interface, so you can easily send print jobs to it from any Apple device, including iPhones. The printer also supports Google Cloud Print, which enables you to print from anywhere you have an internet connection. Lastly, it supports Wi-Fi Direct, which is an expedited, easy way to create an internet connection between two enabled devices.","This is one of the slower printers we reviewed, with a black-and-white print speed of 8.7 pages per minute and a color print speed of 4.5 pages per minute compared to our top pick the <a href=\"/hp-officejet-pro-review\">HP Officejet Pro</a> which can do over 15 a minute. This means that this multifunction printer is suited for a home office or an extremely small business office, but it is too slow to handle the high-volume print jobs that many small-to-medium businesses require.","This notion is reinforced by Epson not giving the XP-410 a monthly duty cycle rating. Most of the all-in-one printers we reviewed had a rating that corresponded to an approximate number of pages the printer could produce per month. Because the XP-410 is not rated, you can assume that this printer is intended for light use (think less than 2,000 pages per month).","This printer prints documents at a maximum resolution of 5,760 x 1,440 dots per inch, which is one of the best resolutions among the printers we reviewed. It supports duplexing, but you must manually feed the paper back into the printer in order to flip sides. Some of the best all-in-one printers have automatic duplexing, which flips the paper inside of the printer.","It also has a scanner, which scans at an optical resolution of 1,200 x 1,200 dpi, giving you plenty of detail. It does not have fax capabilities. Epson ships the printer with a one-year warranty, which is standard for an all-in-one printer. Our interaction with its customer service team members was about average, as they were friendly but only somewhat knowledgeable about the product."]},"id":"93d8f954-2777-46a1-a96e-e93fc70c5904","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5d3384f0-e054-4f60-9162-59230ca0b9ef","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The greatest strength of the Epson XP-410 is how connectable it is.
