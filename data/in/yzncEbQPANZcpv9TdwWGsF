This push mower does have 11-inch rear wheels, which are ideal for hills and will be able to aid you in the handling of the bumpy terrain. The TB130 push mower also has a three-position handle, allowing you to adjust the height to maximize your comfort.","The best lawn mowers have a large cutting deck for precision trimming. The Troy-Bilt TB130 is one of the best and sports a 21-inch steel deck with the advanced TriAction cutting system. The one, two, three punch of the system is all about meticulousness. The Rake Guard passes through each blade of grass making it easier for the S-Blade to cut each one evenly. You are able to choose from six different cutting height settings from 1.25 inches to 3.75 inches."]},"id":"3b907645-e167-4c81-b6b6-d69202d64de7","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/GMfks3PzHLCGRcsTA8wZSg.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56376-troy-bilt4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GMfks3PzHLCGRcsTA8wZSg.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"GMfks3PzHLCGRcsTA8wZSg","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GMfks3PzHLCGRcsTA8wZSg.jpg","alt":""},"id":"8840309a-4c3b-4c9d-b46d-03761b083256","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["One of our favorite features is the 3-in-1 convertible grass disposal options, including side discharge, mulch and rear bag.
