Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Winplus Beacon GPS Tracker serves as a standard personal <a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\">GPS tracker</a> in Sport mode, which will help you find your homebase when you’re hiking or walking. While the help and support options are limited and the software is Windows-only, their user manuals and FAQs section are excellent, and the battery life is great. It used to do double-duty, allowing you to also actively track your children or teen driver, but Winplus recently ceased supporting that feature.","As mentioned above, the Winplus Beacon GPS Tracker used to have two distinct modes, a standard Navigation mode, which is no longer active, and a Sport mode. The Sport mode is basically a digital compass and a GPS navigator, and you use it while walking or hiking to find points of interest. Then you can use it to find your way back to a saved location, such as your car, home or tent.","The battery lasts about 16 hours when you’re using it in Navigation mode and about 160 hours when you use it intermittently, such as in Sport mode. Of course, as with any electronic device, the battery life will vary depending on how you use it. You will need to register and calibrate your Winplus Beacon GPS Tracker before using it. It’s fairly simple to do, and there are good instructions in both the user manual and a special calibration guide.","When using the Sport mode, you can save a location – such as your car, home or tent if you’re camping – and then go hiking or walking, and then use the device to find your way back to the saved location. It will provide arrows pointing in the right direction, along with a digital compass and the current longitude and latitude. You can also use that information to find certain points of interest when you’re hiking in, say, a national park, by using the compass and a map. The Sport mode uses very little battery power, because it’s only being used when you need it, so the battery can last up to 160 hours on a single charge in the standby mode.","Winplus offers only a handful of help and support options for their Beacon GPS Tracker, including a calibration guide, in addition to a handful of guides and instructions on using their service and GPS tracker, along with an excellent and thorough FAQs section. On their site there is a blog, but it hasn’t been updated in a few years.","If you need more help or require technical support, you can reach Winplus by filling out an email form on their site. The response is quick, which is good. The website doesn’t point to a phone number, but the user manual gives a toll free customer service number. We called the phone number with a question about the software to do active tracking, and they informed us the company is no longer supporting the service, only the Sport mode. The company has an official Twitter account, but they don&#39;t seem to be very active on it. We recommend sending them an email if you have questions."]},"id":"6aeb0a2e-bdf8-4860-8df4-3916e39e74b3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fe40a4d6-4ed0-4212-bc73-35eae5170f41","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Winplus GPS Tracker is a solid device for finding your way back to your car, tent or home, which is great if you like to hike or travel in areas you aren’t familiar with.
