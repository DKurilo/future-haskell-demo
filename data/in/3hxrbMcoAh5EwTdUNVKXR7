The four sealed burners protect each of the flames that produce an impressive total of 36,000 BTUs or British Thermal Units. A common critique of gas burners is their slow boiling times, but the right front burner produces up to 12,000 BTUs for power boiling and frying quickly. The low simmer burner, located on the right rear, holds a modest 5,000 BTUs to give you steady control while melting or thickening sauces and cooking other delicate foods.","The simple controls on the right are color coordinated with the black, white or stainless steel options. With the three finish options, youâ€™ll find the right Frigidaire 30-inch to match your other appliances. The porcelain surface on the black and white models is easy to clean with typical all-purpose cleaner. You can remove the cast iron grates for quick access to the burner areas."]},"id":"dbd0af9c-a0d7-4d84-8d84-6a8503274ec0","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/9Jz2YLqMeCt5SeG7MrjaQT.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"In case of boil overs or spills, the electronic pilotless ignition will keep the flame alive. The advantages of this type of ignition include flame health, ease of use and energy efficiency. Before installing, be sure you have at least a 15-amp circuit available to activate this feature.

If you don&#39;t have a natural gas connection in your kitchen, the Frigidaire 30-inch includes a conversion kit so you can use liquid propane. Though propane is less efficient than gas, it is a safer alternative to the risks associated with gas leaks and fires.","One standout feature of this Frigidaire model is the square grates. Round grates are common in gas and electric cooktops and cover necessary surface area on your cookware. However, the square grates give you more stability and cover a wider surface area. They&#39;re close to the cooktop&#39;s surface to make it easy to more heavy pots and pans away from the burners to the counter or from burner to burner.","The Frigidaire 30-inch gas cooktop is simple to use and has a traditional look that won&#39;t go out of style. Though it lacks specialized features, it&#39;s a great beginner cooktop or extra addition to a kitchen island, and the basic color options can match the other appliances in your kitchen."]},"id":"09fdeee9-1e3d-48cc-8cdd-b8d077320518","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58114","url":"/frigidaire-30-inch-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-13T12:54:21Z","datePublished":"2013-11-13T12:54:21Z","name":"Frigidaire 30-inch FFCG3015LB","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks in our lineup.
