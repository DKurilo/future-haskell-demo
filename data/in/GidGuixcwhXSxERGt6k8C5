This ceramic glass cooktop has heavy-duty, die-cast metal knobs for its controls. These are easy to operate and are arranged logically to correspond with the burners, but they are a bit close together. Still, they take up as much or more room than most touch control panels.","You push the knobs in or out as needed to get either the single- or double-burner function. You can remove the knobs when you want to clean the cooktop for obstruction-free cleaning. If these seem too old-fashioned for you, the more modern touch controls of the <a href=\"/whirlpool-g7ce3034xb-review\">Whirlpool Gold G9CE3065XS</a> might suit your needs better.","A representative from Maytag we talked to said two of the best features on Maytag electric cooktops are the Speed Heat and Dual-Choice elements. The Speed Heat element uses electromagnetic waves to bring water to a rapid boil and for other tasks like heating a wok for stir-fry. Unfortunately, the MEC9536BS model doesn’t include this feature. It does, however, have two Dual-Choice heating elements that help save energy by expanding from 6 to 12 inches to accommodate small and large pans. Each of these dual heating elements has a powerful 3,000-watt output so you can heat food and boil water fast.","The burner in the center serves as a food warmer and provides low temperatures so you can simmer foods or simply keep them warm without overcooking. The other elements provide a variety of watts and temperatures for precision cooking of all kinds. The cooktop is durable and easy to clean and maintain. The representative we talked to said Maytag’s electric cooktops are made of shatter-resistant glass that is stringently tested for reliability. According to the representative, this guards against scratches, chips and cracks and makes it easy to clean up spills and grease.","The cooktop&#39;s design is simple and balanced. Since the double burners are located in the far corners, you have more space when you are using them both at the same time. The optional stainless-steel border gives the cooktop a sharp, modern look. LEDs indicate when the heat is on or off. Unfortunately, there is no control lock on this cooktop to prevent children from turning a burner on when you’re not looking. However, the lights stay on even if the appliance is turned off until the burner has cooled sufficiently to avoid hurting anyone who might touch it, which adds an important safety element.","This cooktop has the single best warranty of any cooktop we evaluated. The representative we talked to said Maytag extended its 10-year limited parts warranty to include every new Maytag appliance model, giving you the support you need to keep appliances performing well. “The 10-year limited parts warranty covers cooktop burners and elements, ceramic top and grates,” the representative said.","The Maytag MEC9536BS is a well-designed electric cooktop that gives you cooking flexibility with two dual burners that expand from 6 to 12 inches and the cooktop’s five elements provide a wide range of temperatures for precision cooking. The controls are conveniently placed and easy to use, if a bit too close together. The ceramic glass with stainless steel controls looks attractive in most kitchens; it’s also durable and easy to clean. Unfortunately, it lacks a Speed Heat function and child locks. This is an economical, practical option for people who want the modern conveniences of an electric cooktop but still like traditional features."]},"id":"5fb367fc-e2d3-491e-8a90-757254ffca4b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57680","url":"/maytag-mec4536wc-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-03T12:20:27Z","datePublished":"2013-10-03T12:20:27Z","name":"Maytag MEC9536BS","synopsis":"The Maytag MEC9536BS 36-inch electric cooktop is an attractive and affordable model that offers two dual burners, which you can adjust to fit the pan sizes you are using.
