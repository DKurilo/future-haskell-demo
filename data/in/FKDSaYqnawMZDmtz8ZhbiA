You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Aquagenix Fusion <a href=\"/best-handheld-showerheads\">7-Setting Hand Shower</a> is one of the more innovative showerheads because of its refillable shower handle. With a built-in reservoir, the handle holds a selection of prefilled cartridges. You can insert one of the mineral and activated charcoal cartridges to condition and purify your water, or you can use one of the aromatherapy cartridges to fill your shower with scents such as citrus or lavender. The showerhead comes with two cartridges, but you can choose from a variety of other options at most bath and body stores, or you can order them directly from the manufacturer. The cartridges also have removable caps, so you can insert any type of bath salts or water treatment granules. While it is possible to use the shower without filling the cartridges, you may not want to do that after you&#39;ve experienced a spa-like shower in your own bathroom.","An excellent way to save money on your water use, this Aquagenix hand-held showerhead has several water-saving settings to reduce your energy costs. The economy rain setting delivers a light water flow that is also perfect for those who prefer a gentle spray. You can also activate the convenient pause mode while you are shaving or washing your hair and don&#39;t need the water running directly on you.","This showerhead can be used as a fixed showerhead if you prefer a hands-free shower. It fits any standard shower arm, so it is easy to install without the use of tools. If you prefer the freedom the hand-held fixture offers, this showerhead comes with a flexible 5-foot stainless steel hose that resists rust and corrosion.","The settings on the Aquageix Fusion hand-held showerhead allow you to switch settings back and forth between people in your family, which easily ensures everyone gets the perfect shower experience. You can choose spray options like rain, pulsating massage, hydro-mist, rain massage, rain mist, economy rain and the pause function.","Overall, the Aquagenix Fusion 7-Setting Hand Shower delivers an excellent shower experience that&#39;s much cheaper than visiting a spa. With the added cartridge compartment, it brings a luxurious experience right into your own home. It&#39;s easy to set up and you can actually save money with its water-saving features."]},"id":"68fae531-312a-4ddf-a990-6797e161952b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62902","url":"/aquagenix-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-19T22:26:38Z","datePublished":"2015-02-19T22:26:38Z","name":"Aquagenix Fusion 7-Setting Hand Shower","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-19T22:26:38Z","id":"FKDSaYqnawMZDmtz8ZhbiA","meta":{"title":"Aquagenix Fusion 7-Setting Hand Shower Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Aquagenix.
