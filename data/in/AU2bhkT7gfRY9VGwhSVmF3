The Astrabeds SerenityBed Queen serves as an example of this all-natural approach, offering a mattress free of toxic chemical manufacturing and that naturally circulates air and repels allergens. The mattress offers eight inches of flexible layers to provide you with an incredible feeling of comfort and relief from spinal pressure each night.","The Astrabeds SerenityBed Queen is made of 100 percent natural Talalay latex and New Zealand wool in addition to certified organic cotton. The organic latex mattress is separated into a six-inch core and a two-inch comfort layer, both of which can be adjusted in terms of firmness for the most individualized sleeping experience. The latex is created free of hazardous, chemical-based glues, instead allowing you to interchange layers as needed.","Latex beds commonly wrap each layer of latex in organic cotton covers. These layers increase the breathability of the mattress, ensuring excess heat is removed from your body during the night. In addition, the latex also includes the use of wool, which plays a large part in regulating heat, removing moisture from the body and increasing the comfort of your experience.","The Astrabeds SerenityBed Queen protects your purchase with three different guarantees offered to each buyer. When you first purchase the mattress, you are given both a 90-day exchange and money-back guarantee. If you want to try a different level of firmness, you are free to exchange the core or comfort layer. Or, if you simply arenâ€™t satisfied with the purchase, you can return it for the entire cost of the mattress. Once satisfied with your purchase, the all-natural latex mattress is protected by a 25-year warranty.","The Astrabeds SerenityBed Queen makes a dedicated effort at creating an all-natural experience for consumers concerned with allergen-free and organic beds. The use of latex provides a natural level of protection against common mattress issues like dust mites while still encouraging proper air circulation throughout your mattress and body. The result is an ideal sleeping environment to get you through the night without discomfort."]},"id":"fb356749-5dc6-4d43-b899-add18c6c2468","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59297","url":"/astrabeds-latex-mattresses-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-09T13:25:28Z","datePublished":"2014-04-09T13:25:28Z","name":"Astrabeds SerenityBed Queen","synopsis":"The latex mattress is attributed as among the most organic and natural of bedding available to consumers.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The latex mattress is attributed as among the most organic and natural of bedding available to consumers.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-04-09T13:25:28Z","id":"AU2bhkT7gfRY9VGwhSVmF3","meta":{"title":"Astrabeds SerenityBed Queen Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Astrabeds SerenityBed Queen is one of the best latex mattresses available due to its organic materials and level of comfort.
