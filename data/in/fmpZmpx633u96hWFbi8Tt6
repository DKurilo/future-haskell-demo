It&#39;s an HD camcorder for amateur and freelance filmmakers and videographers. If you&#39;re looking for something to take with you on vacation or film your baby&#39;s first words, the G20 is much more expensive than many other HD video cameras on this lineup. However, it&#39;s a good starting camcorder to help you break into filmmaking or start recording events in a professional capacity.","At 1080p resolution, the G20 is a full HD camcorder that captures every detail. Its unique lens hood helps control the light coming into the lens, and the manual focus ring feels natural. Unfortunately, its maximum frame rate is 30 fps, which could lead to horizontal lines on your TV or monitor when you view the footage. The movement still looks natural, but the G20 is a generation behind in terms of film speed.","The camera is a little larger than most of the other high-definition camcorders we reviewed, but this extra size is easier to control when filming with manual controls. However, it is far too bulky for vacationers or point-and-shoot recordings. It has 32GB of built-in storage space and two memory card slots. At its full capacity, you can record over 12 hours of video. The battery is equally impressive, able to film for two and a half hours.","This camcorder has a few notable flaws, including its poor software. It makes transferring footage to a computer a tough challenge. It also does not use a standard shoe adapter, so you have to buy Canon accessories if you want a light or shotgun microphone. This camcorder also lacks integrated Wi-Fi and near-field communication, so you cannot stream your video or upload clips quickly."]},"id":"00067630-8510-4052-812c-c0dfb04fc6c3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9d27dc9e-f0e1-4738-80ab-c93d2406ffa2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Canon VIXIA HF G20 is an indie filmmaker camcorder, offering full HD resolution and an excellent design.
