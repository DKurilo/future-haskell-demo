Clicking the Visit Site button will take you to this new version for purchase. We will evaluate, rank and review the latest version when we next update the Single-Cup Coffee Makers reviews. Meanwhile, enjoy our original review below about the Keurig 2.0 K450.<br/></em>","The Keurig 2.0 K450 Brewing System is one of Keurig&#39;s heavier-duty models, and its main feature is that it can read the lid of every K-Cup so that it knows the ideal amount of water and the heat required to get the best out of each brew.","Getting to the basics first, this <a href=\"/best-single-cup-coffee-makers\">single-cup coffee maker</a> has a generous 70-ounce water reservoir and accepts the company&#39;s K-Cups and K-Carafes. The latter is used to brew a 4-cup pot of coffee, which is partly why the water reservoir is so big. Consequently, it can handle much larger vessels than many other single-cup coffee makers.","In addition, it features the usual auto-off setting and has a reasonable strength control. There&#39;s also a touchscreen that&#39;s simple enough to use. The touchscreen lets you set your favorites so that you can immediately access your favorite brews exactly as you want them. That&#39;s a good feature to have on a one-cup coffee maker because it means you don&#39;t have to mess around when you&#39;re tired and need that coffee.","Keurig also boasts that it has nine cup sizes available, from 4 ounces to 30 ounces. However, these sizes depend on the pod you put in, so not all sizes will be available every time. The drip tray is removable, as you&#39;d expect, and it also includes a water filter.","The biggest feature in the Keurig 2.0 K450 Brewing System is what Keurig calls its 2.0 brewing technology. This effectively reads the top of the K-Cup or K-Carafe and determines what settings to use, and it also cross-references these settings with your favorites.","However, this system cannot handle anything but the Keurig K-Cups. This means you cannot use it to make coffee via ground coffee using reusable K-Cups, and you may not be able to use your existing stock of K-Cups, either. In addition, this one-cup coffee maker cannot make hot water for tea or hot chocolate either, one of the basic features that is included on much lower-priced machines. If you want greater variety in your coffee making, you might want to examine the <a href=\"/bunn-review\">Bunn My Cafe MCU</a>.","While Keurig has produced a convenient machine with its introduction of the K-Carafe and the 2.0 brewing system, the machine requires that you stick to exclusively Keurig-branded products. This does limit your options severely, and you can get machines that are more versatile at a much lower cost. With the Keurig 2.0 K450 Brewing System, you get a convenient single-serve coffee maker, but it comes at the expense of versatility."]},"id":"56b08667-7d20-495e-8032-47b3ec962140","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61440","url":"/keurig-2-0-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-09T00:28:14Z","datePublished":"2014-12-09T00:28:14Z","name":"Keurig 2.0","synopsis":"Editor's Note: A newer version of this product is now available.
