HereÂ s more on choosing a system to meet your needs, along with detail on how we arrived at our ranking of 10 PPC Management Services. </em>","Pay per click, commonly known as PPC, is one way that search engines, and therefore customers, find your website. PPC marketing is an essential part of online marketing and key to ensuring target audiences find your company&#39;s website.","PPC Management is just one part of online marketing services, and it may be beneficial for you to look into some other services like <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-seo-tools-and-rank-trackers/\">SEO tools</a> or a complete <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">online marketing</a> provider. You may also want to check out an article from Business News Daily, our sister site, on <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7168-internet-marketing-services.html\">25 Internet Marketing Services for Small Businesses</a>.","<strong>How Does PPC Marketing Work?</strong>","PPC advertising is a delicate process that relies heavily on a search engine bidding process and a system where advertisers pay for each click on their ads. The goal of PPC is to bring in quality customers; you do not want to pay for clicks or leads that do not lead to sales or an increase in revenue.","Keywords drive pay per click management. When you bid for keywords, you want your paid advertisements to score high and therefore appear near the top of the search engine results. Popular search engines, like Bing and Google, determine your ad rank. They build this score based on the amount you are willing to pay for a keyword, cost per click and the quality of your ad.","Search engines serve their users, so you are more likely to receive a high ad rank if yours ads serve their users well. You can establish a high ad rank by having ads that are properly identified and have relevant information.","Staying on top of the keywords you are bidding on is crucial for ensuring that you are not paying too much for clicks on your keywords and that you are getting the most out of your successful keyword bids. Managing your keyword account can take hours out of every day, pulling you away from the tasks you need to focus on to build your company. If the hours you spend managing your PPC account are adding up, then it may be time to turn to a professional that will manage your pay per click campaign for you.","<strong>What Do PPC Management Companies Do?</strong>","PPC advertising specialists help you get the most out of your bid dollars by working to select the best keywords. The best keywords are the ones that will drive traffic to your site for the lowest cost. You do not want to spend more on a click than you have to, especially if it is a keyword that is not converting leads to sales.","Advertising specialists will help you target ads on the platforms that you choose. You can run pay per click advertisements on popular search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo, and even on social networks, like Facebook, Pinterest and even LinkedIn. The company that you choose to manage your pay per click campaign should work closely with you to decide which platform is best for your business.","Our Gold Award Winner, Silverback Strategies, excels in providing this type of service. When you pair with it, a consultant will conduct preliminary research into your field, PPC history and your website. If Silverback strategists decide that they can help you with your PPC management, they will work closely with you to develop a PPC advertising plan.","Important Factors in PPC Management","When choosing a company to manage your pay per click campaigns, there are a few features you should consider. The first is the set of features a company offers, then its level of experience and the reporting features it provides, and lastly, its willingness and ability to provide thorough customer service.","<strong>Experience</strong>","The first factor you want to evaluate and discuss with a company is its level of experience, not just how many years it has been in business but also what industries it is most familiar with. You almost should consider companies that are Bing-accredited and Google-certified partners in PPC management. While these certifications are widely available, they are not just handed out.","In order to receive a Google certification for AdWords, PPC consultants must prove their aptitude in pay per click campaign management. Demonstrating their skill entails taking exams in PPC management that cover things like online advertising, optimization practices and best practices for campaign management.","About half of the services on our lineup have gone this extra mile and acquired a Google certification or Bing accreditation. One of these companies is <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/jumpfly-inc/\">Jumpfly</a>, one of the most popular PPC management companies in the industry. Jumpfly specializes in PPC management and does not focus its efforts on any other part of online marketing. This means that consultants are not pulled in different directions and can focus all of their expertise on your PPC marketing.","<strong>Reporting</strong>","PPC campaigns create large amounts of data that is quantifiable and useful for driving your marketing efforts. Detailed reporting is an essential piece of a PPC campaign; information needs to be carefully tracked so that you can know if your ad-spend is being used in the best way. PPC advertising provides real-time results, so you can quickly see what is not working and make adjustments.","Any company should provide you as many or as few reports as you want. You might want to stay involved in your PPC campaign and receive weekly reports and updates from your campaign manager. On the other hand, you might want to focus on other aspects of your business and only receive updates once a month. Good PPC management companies give you the flexibility to decide which reporting schedule is best for your needs.","<a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/the-ppc-guys/\">The PPC Guys</a> focuses solely on PPC management and runs specialized tests to gather data for your campaign. This company will help you see which keywords are working and which are not hitting their targets. These tests, A/B tests, run two copies of each ad directly against each other to see which performs better. When data from the tests starts to come in, PPC consultants analyze this data and utilize it to closely target your audience.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong>","A company that you can collaborate with to grow your business is a very important part of PPC marketing. You need to rest assured that whoever is working on your marketing campaign is just as dedicated to your success as you are.","One service that exemplifies good help and support is <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/network-solutions/\">Network Solutions</a>. Its representatives are friendly and reliable. When we had questions, they focused on the questions at hand and did not try to upsell us on other products. This company also has a full service help and support center for answering both basic and complicated PPC questions.","<strong>What Else Is Important in Selecting a PPC Service?</strong>","While the attributes discussed above should be the leading considerations when deciding which pay per click management service is best for you, other factors and features may sway your decision. Here is a rundown of some of the other features that are important to consider for your company&#39;s PPC advertising.","<strong>Ad Design </strong>","Most paid advertisements are text ads, without images or any form of media, but you also have the option to buy rich media ads. Rich media ads contain videos or images, or they require some type of user interaction.","Rich media ads can draw a bigger response from your audience. When the goal is to encourage click-throughs, rich media ads can help you engage your users at much higher rates than traditional text ads.","Not all PPC companies will help you design rich media ads. Some companies that do not provide rich media ad creation will refer you to a designer they have collaborated with in the past. This is useful and saves you the time of searching out a designer on your own. Other companies leave it up to you to choose a designer and will then market whatever ad you have created. You have a range of options for rich media ad creation, giving you the ability to choose a method that best fits your budget.","<strong>Landing Page Optimization</strong>","Even the best pay per click advertising cannot convert clicks into sales if the page consumers go to is not well designed. The best way to turn clicks into leads, and then sales, is to drive traffic not to your homepage but to a landing page.","A landing page should be straight to the point with a call to action. While your homepage might full of important information about your company, homepages are often too crowded, dense and too information heavy for consumers. If there is too much information present, consumers are less likely to take action.","To ensure the best return on investment, the page that your ads lead to should be specially designed to pull your visitors into action. Landing pages should have calls to action and the tools your visitors need to take action then and there. Once visitors leave your landing page, the chances of them taking action have dropped dramatically.","<a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/seo-com/\">SEO.com</a> is one company on our lineup that helps you create the best landing page for your PPC campaign. This company conducts a survey of your landing page to evaluate how well it will work and engage your audience. It then gives advice and helps you fine-tune your landing page. SEO.com provides several services to help you optimize your landing page, including content creation, page design, layout and structure, and potential site problems.","<strong>PPC Management Verdict and Recommendations</strong>","Through our review process, Silverback Strategies, eBrandz and Webimax stood out and proved that they are ahead of the pack when it comes to providing the best PPC management services. These services outperformed the competition and provided the most complete set of features to help you design the best marketing strategy for your company.","Though these are our top three, other products did exceptionally well. For example, Jumpfly focuses solely on PPC management and is both a Google partner and Bing accredited. Network Solutions, the number seven product, is a full service marketing company and can help you keep all of your marketing in one place. While a PPC campaign may seem like a large expense for small businesses, the best PPC services provide specialized attention and make every advertising dollar count."]},"id":"dbf71895-0f0b-48af-b04e-94c01c93656f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"f86f3a70-a1e5-4ed3-a231-93d6fcc4ce3b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.silverbackstrategies.com/zero-risk.html \">Silverback Strategies</a>","<a href=\"http://www.ebrandz.com\">eBrandz</a>","<a href=\"http://lp.webimax.com/ppc-services?utm_source=Review%20Site&utm_medium=Banner&utm_campaign=PPC&utm_content=&campaignid=TopTenReviews.com-PPC&adgroupid=&utm_term=&leadsource=TopTenReviews.com\">WebiMax</a>","<a href=\"http://www.seo.com\">SEO.com</a>","<a href=\"http://www.theppcguys.com/\">The PPC Guys</a>","<a href=\"http://www.jumpfly.com\">JumpFly, Inc.</a>","<a href=\"//network-solutions.7eer.net/c/13013/11295/555?subId1=PPCManagement\">Network Solutions</a>","<a href=\"http://www.isotree.com\">isoTree</a>","<a href=\"http://www.ppcmanagement.com\">That Company!</a>","<a href=\"http://www.evoba.com\">Evoba</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"4b60bc06-b109-42c7-a8b4-e9bbd3985b77","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_705","url":"/best-ppc-management-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"andreas-rivera","url":"/author/andreas-rivera","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Andreas Rivera","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"WxjvxyhZNtkBfxLLfmCHVe","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-11-05T17:13:15Z","datePublished":"2015-06-15T20:30:15Z","name":"PPC Management Review","synopsis":"PPC management can be difficult and time consuming.
