In addition to <a href=\"/best-auto-loan-services\">auto loans</a>, it offers mortgages, personal loans and other standard banking services. With good rates, high mileage limits and a quick approval process, Bank of America is a good choice, especially if you’re looking at used cars.","As of July, Bank of America posted rates of 3.69% for a new car and 3.89% for a used car. The new car rate is slightly higher than average but lower than at <a href=\"/wells-fargo-review\">Wells Fargo</a> and <a href=\"/chase-review\">Chase</a>. On the other hand, its used car rate is one of the lowest we saw.","Bear in mind that these listed rates assume an excellent credit history. We recommend checking your credit before applying for an auto loan. Use the calculators and payment estimation tools on Bank of America’s website to get an idea of the rates and monthly payments you can expect before you apply. Other factors that influence your interest rate include the loan amount, the length of the loan and the state you live in. You may also be eligible for discounts on your rate if you sign up for Bank of America’s rewards program.","Bank of America’s loan terms range from 12 months to 60 months. Shorter term loans tend to have lower rates but higher monthly payments. Some lenders offer terms that exceed 60 months, but in general, you don’t want a term much longer than that because you’ll end up paying more than the car is worth as it depreciates.","Applications are usually approved within one business day. Bank of America is one of the better lenders to finance a used car through. You can get a car with up to 125,000 miles, which is the highest mileage limit we saw. In addition, the car can be up to 10 years old.","There are no prepayment or origination fees at Bank of America. You can also apply to refinance an existing loan if you want a lower rate or want to change the term length."]},"id":"7aaa4168-b88c-4fc9-a3e1-987f04245fe8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70232","url":"/bank-of-america-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-11T19:50:05Z","datePublished":"2018-09-11T19:50:05Z","name":"Bank of America","synopsis":"Bank of America has 4,600 branches across the United States, making it one of the largest banks in the country.
