The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 reviews on</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/kitchen/best-dishwashers/\">Dishwashers</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Bosch 300 Series SHX53T55UC dishwasher has the bare minimum in functionality and features, but an impressive sound level and place setting capacity. Its 46-decibel sound level keeps it among the quietest in our dishwasher comparison, and you can fit up to 15 place settings into a single load on its two racks.","You get four wash cycles and four wash options with this Bosch dishwasher, all of which are very basic. The wash cycles are heavy, auto, normal and rinse. The four wash options are delay start, delicate, sanitize and extra shine.","The dishwasher lacks both a small load wash function and a quick wash cycle; however, this is not a deal-breaker with this basic dishwasher. It comes with a sanitize wash option, which is certified by the National Sanitation Foundation. This function will clean your dishes with a high temperature so you can be sure your dishes come out sanitized.","The running indicator light is a useful feature on this dishwasher. Because the unit has hidden controls that sit on top of the door instead of on the front of the unit, it’s difficult to know when the unit is running. However, this Bosch dishwasher includes a red InfoLight, which shines onto the floor when the unit is running and turns off when the dishes are ready to be taken out.","This Bosch dishwasher unit is ENERGY STAR qualified, but excludes an eco-friendly wash cycle and eco-friendly drying options. Regardless, according to its EnergyGuide, this dishwasher is already quite energy efficient. It costs an estimated $27 to operate annually, consuming 253 kilowatt-hours every year. Both of these figures are quite low.","Bosch offers a great warranty with this built-in dishwasher. The labor and parts are covered for a year, while the racks and electronics have a five-year warranty. Additionally, Bosch backs the unit’s tub and door liner with a lifetime warranty.","If you have warranty questions and other concerns, you can contact Bosch for support by phone or email. Additionally, Bosch provides the unit’s user manual, some FAQs and tutorials on its website for your convenience."]},"id":"68e5cf4b-626a-4561-8260-92bf4bd071f7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4fcb8d92-4625-40ad-a1df-2b168c2187d3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bosch 300 Series SHX53T55UC dishwasher has very basic functionality.
