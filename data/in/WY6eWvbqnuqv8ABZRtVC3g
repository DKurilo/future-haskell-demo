Each test in the Pro-Lab kit requires you to prepare a petri dish by pouring a mold medium, or a growth hormone, into the dish. After the growth hormone hardens, you can use the petri dish in one of three methods to collect a sample. We found that the settling plate method was the easiest test, in which you place the prepared petri dish on flat service and leave it for one hour. After the test is finished, you seal the dish with a lid and allow the sample to incubate for at least two days.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/54682-pro-lab-incorporated-mo1091.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8xSrRyGh2UEMvJPBm6N8hE.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"8xSrRyGh2UEMvJPBm6N8hE","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8xSrRyGh2UEMvJPBm6N8hE.jpg","alt":""},"id":"4c6b2830-107b-4dc9-800b-002b2e8f1a71","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The next method is called the visual sampling method in which you wipe visual mold with a sterile swab, included in the kit. Making sure that mold has adhered to the swab, you transfer the mold to the petri dish. Once the mold has been transferred to the dish, you seal the petri dish and send both the dish and the swab  for analysis.","The last method, called the HVAC method, is the technique Pro-Lab recommends to test your air, since most mold problems occur in air conditioning and heating vents. However, this test is a little more complicated than the other methods. First, you attach the petri dish to the furthest vent and shut every other vent. Then, you run the system fan for ten minutes. Much like the settle test, the air settles onto the growth hormone in the petri dish. After the test, you seal and incubate the test plate for at least two days.","The settle and HVAC method tests allow you to identify mold samples growing in your home.
