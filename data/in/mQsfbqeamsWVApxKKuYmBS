Nonetheless, all small businesses must deal with the financial side of its operations and must do it well if they want to stay solvent and in the law&#39;s favor. While there&#39;s <a href=\"/best-online-payroll-services\">accounting software</a> to help take some of the pain out of the process, it&#39;s not always enough. If your books start falling behind or if you find that you&#39;re spend more time thinking about your ledgers than your business leads, an accountant might be able to relieve this burden, allowing you to put your talents where they matter most: improving your company and product.","Hiring a professional bookkeeping or accounting service can make financial sense as well. Good accountants have education and skill to get things done right, plus they know the shortcuts. What might take two hours for you, a skilled accountant might be able to accomplish in less than one. Further, it&#39;s their job to keep up on the latest laws and statutes. This is especially important come tax time, where a change in law could mean hundreds of dollars in refunds - keeping you safe from audit.","On average, regular accountants charge $100 to $275 an hour, but there are outsourcing companies that can do it at a fraction of that cost. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/flatworld/\">Flatworld</a>, for example, advertises rates as low as $8 an hour. Some companies, like <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/expertise/\">Expertise</a>, charge solely by the hour, but others, like <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/ledgersonline/\">LedgersOnline</a>, charge per month for a particular set of duties. Still others, like <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/merritt-bookkeeping/\">Merritt Bookkeeping</a>, prefer to discuss your needs and develop a custom quote. Finally, a few offer specific plans with the option of adding services. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/tad/\">TAD</a> does this.","We&#39;ve looked at ten services that do offsite accounting work using cloud-based technology, phone and email. Because they take on multiple clients on a part-time basis, they can significantly cut their costs. However, most still endeavor to get to know your business before taking you as a client.","<strong>Accounting &amp; Bookkeeping Services: What to Look For</strong>","Outsourcing your accounting only brings you peace of mind if you are comfortable with the service you hire. Don&#39;t rush the exploration process. Most accounting firms arrange a phone conference with you to answer questions and make sure your business is a good fit. In fact, some require it before sending you a proposal. Take advantage of this by carefully examining them for the following qualifications.","<strong>Basic Bookkeeping &amp; Additional Tasks</strong><br/>If your company is small, you may only need basic bookkeeping to keep your paperwork in order. Nearly all bookkeeping and accounting companies provide the basics: keeping your ledgers current and accurate, handling accounts payable and receivable, and getting finances in order for tax preparation. Many do not prepare tax returns, although some can recommend tax preparers. If you have a tax accountant you are comfortable with, this may not be an issue, but you should ask what support the accounting service provides.","If you are growing, however, you may need additional services, such as payroll, inventory or invoice processing, which most, but not all accounting services provide. Some accounting firms go beyond the standard to provide even higher-level financial duties that you may need on a part-time basis, such as <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/analytix-solutions/\">Analytix&#39;s</a> ability to supply a part-time CFO. Others provide investment or business advice. If you have a growing company and think you may need these in the near future, initially hiring a service with the potential for these abilities means that company will be familiar with your business when you need the additional help, which makes it easier for it to give you the best service.","<strong>Employee Qualifications &amp; Duties</strong><br/>When hiring a service, it&#39;s important to know whether you need an accountant or a bookkeeper. <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/15-accountant-bookkeeper-differences.html\">Each plays a different role for a business</a>, but in short, a bookkeeper deals with the nitty-gritty of updating ledgers and making sure everything balances out. Full-charge bookkeepers have experience not just in data entry and ledgers but payroll, financial statements and bank reconciliation. They have a bachelor&#39;s degree in finance.","Accountants look at the bigger financial picture: how certain items should be recorded to make the most sense for that particular business, for example. Accountants can also audit books, analyze the flow of money and generate reports on that flow, and prepare taxes. Certified Public Accountants have advanced degrees to provide higher-level advice. They can also represent you to the IRS should you be audited. Most organizations employ all three types of people, but each commands different wages.","Therefore, when looking into a small business accounting service, ask about the duties each type of employee conducts. After all, you probably don&#39;t want to pay a CPA to do simple data entry. Similarly, if you have complex finances or have been hit with an audit before, you may prefer to have a CPA take care of your books and tax preparation rather than a regular accountant. You may have a team rather than a single part-time employee. <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/accountingdepartment/\">AccountingDepartment.com</a>, for example, assigns you a team with a full-charge bookkeeper, accountant and CPA.","<strong>Geographic &amp; Business Focus</strong><br/>One reason for hiring an offsite accountant rather than a local one is that such companies have a broader clientele that lets them cut costs. Nonetheless, the last thing you want is to trust your financial records with someone you can&#39;t understand. Fluent English is important, as is the ability to take complex financial considerations and explain them in simpler terms. In addition, your accountants need to know the laws of the country and even state where you do business. Therefore, an accountant firm in Australia might not be able to provide as good a service for a Colorado business as a firm in Phoenix. All of the accounting companies we looked at speak English and serve the United States, although some serve other countries as well.","It&#39;s also important that the individuals helping with your finances can speak the language of your business – someone in the health field has a different vocabulary than someone running a bike shop. Restaurants in particular have unique financial considerations. Several of the small business bookkeeping and accounting firms we looked at list the fields they have specialties in: <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/bookkeeper-com/\">Bookkeeper.com</a> can handle restaurants, while <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/bookkeeping-express/\">Bookkeeping Express</a> works with spas. Some also focus on stages of business, something to consider if you are a start-up seeking financial advice as well as bookkeeping.","<strong>Communication &amp; Security</strong><br/>You want an accountant that you can work with and who works for you: someone you can call with questions or concerns, someone who understands your business and is able to respond to an emergency in a timely manner. The best companies take time to discuss your business needs with you before taking you on as a client and provide you a point of contact that you can reach during your business hours. This is especially important if you decide to work with a company that outsources to other countries. While it&#39;s great to send off your books at the close of day and find them completed when you return to the office in the morning, it might not be worth it if you have to wait until midnight to call your bookkeeper.","Communication also involves sending your financial data. Each company has its own method, but these can include snail mail, faxing, emailing, uploading to a cloud storage system or sharing a cloud-based accounting system. Some even use remote access software to work on your own computers from their location.","Finances aren&#39;t always fun, but they are the backbone of your business. Therefore, you want to be sure they are safe. Investigate how the firm protects your information – levels of encryption, redundant systems and personnel security. Many, like <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/bench/\">Bench</a>, offer bank-level security: 256-bit encryption, redundant power supplies and <a href=\"/best-background-check-services\">background checks</a> on employees. Communication lines need to be secure as well.","<strong>Conclusion</strong>","Not everyone is born to work with numbers, but when you are running a business, you can&#39;t run away from the bookkeeping and accounting. You can, however, hand it off to someone else who has a talent for tracking the income and expenses of your company. With a competent accounting and bookkeeping service, you can free yourself of this duty so you can turn your attention to the things that grow your business and your success."]},"id":"9c65e404-1257-41e1-98ce-e8333ae4f48b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"19eff7c0-1645-4993-9708-0159aa5f9a66","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/finance/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">AccountingDepartment.com</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/finance/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Analytix Solutions</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/finance/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Bench</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/finance/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Bookkeeper.com</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/finance/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">BookKeeping Express</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/finance/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Expertise</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/finance/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Flatworld</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/finance/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">LedgersOnline</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/finance/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">Merritt Bookkeeping</a>","<a href=\"http://www.buyerzone.com/finance/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services/rfqz/?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788\">TAD</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"c174513b-3bb2-4d5c-adea-83c9348d9061","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1823","url":"/best-accounting-bookkeeping-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-01T15:03:19Z","datePublished":"2016-10-25T18:03:20Z","name":"Accounting & Bookkeeping Services Review","synopsis":"Accounting and bookkeeping services provide full- and part-time services in various aspects, such as balancing the ledgers and preparing taxes, so you can concentrate on the part of your business you love.","review":{},"strapline":"Accounting and bookkeeping services provide full- and part-time services in various aspects, such as balancing the ledgers and preparing taxes, so you can concentrate on the part of your business you love.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-25T18:03:20Z","id":"mQsfbqeamsWVApxKKuYmBS","meta":{"title":"Best Accounting & Bookkeeping Services | Top Ten Reviews","description":"We&#039;ve compared the best accounting &amp; bookkeeping services for 2017.
