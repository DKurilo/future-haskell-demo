Even so, Sundance Spas maintains some unique advantages, including its patented Fluidix Jets. ","<strong>Pricing</strong>","Sundance Spas does not have specific prices listed on its website but does give a list of price ranges that each spa model falls into. These ranges are entry-level for spas up to $7,999, mid-level for spas between $8,000 and $11,999, premium for spas $12,000 to $15,000 and luxury for top-of-the-line spas that cost more than $16,000. The company has more models on the higher end, with 16 premium and luxury models and just nine entry- and mid-level models. Five of the seven recommended “Customer Favorites” also fall into the more expensive categories, indicating that Sundance Spas’ focus rests more in higher-quality spas, which offer more, high-quality features and custom options than the company’s entry-level spas. ","<strong>Models and Lines</strong>","Across its four product lines, Sundance Spas has 25 total <a href=\"/best-hot-tubs\">hot tub models</a>. The 680 series includes seven entry-level and mid-level hot tubs that range from a triangular two-seat model to a square spa that seats up to seven. These spas are described as plug and play, meaning they work with a standard 120v outlet. The other lines are the 780, 880 and 980 lines, with the price and quality of the products increasing with each step up. The higher-quality model lines come with more features and options for vanity options like shell color, as well as more jets and seat types. The 980 series includes four tubs that seat 5-6 or 6-7 people, all of which are in the luxury price category. These spas feature a lounge deck for additional seating outside of the tub as well as a built-in cooler and touchscreen control panel. ","<strong>Jets and Features</strong>","Sundance Spas uses patented Fluidix Jets, which do not have moving parts and therefore have fewer parts that can break down over time. The jets are controllable to personalize your massage and are each designed to mimic a certain type of massage like a Shiatsu or deep tissue massage. The Silent Air Injector jets allow you to add fragrances for aromatherapy without compromising the water quality.","Sundance Spas combine water filtration with UV-C light to keep your spa water clean. The CLEARRAY PRO3TECT Automatic Oxidizer is available as a factory-installed or aftermarket upgrade for some models, which works with the standard CLEARRAY filter and UV water management system. Other factory upgrade options include a Bluewave stereo system and an extra layer of insulation made of recycled blue jean material for colder-weather climates."]},"id":"1d07c4bf-9c43-4419-9c32-d0f7d28516a7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5b40fb0d-52c4-4b91-986d-58516a5dfa47","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["All Sundance Spas are compatible with the SmartTub app, which is available for both iOS and Android devices.
