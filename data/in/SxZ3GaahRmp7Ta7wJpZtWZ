The Kinetic Road Machine <a href=\"/best-bike-trainers-review\">indoor bike trainer</a> stands apart from other fluid trainer brands in its field because of its outstanding user convenience, reliability and smart capabilities.","There is a lot to love about the Kinetic Road Machine. One of the best things about this fluid trainer is the low noise level. You can easily watch your smart phone, tablet or TV while exercising and not worry about bothering others with the sound. Because itâ€™s a fluid trainer, it also has a much more realistic, road-like feel than most magnet and wind trainers.","Kinetic has a wide range of products that are compatible with smart devices. Typically for Kinetic, the higher the price, the more smart bells and virtual whistles you&#39;ll receive. While the Kinetic Road Machine is on the low-end of Kinetic&#39;s products, it can still be adapted to have smart functions. If you purchase and install the Kinetic inRide Watt Meter to the Road Machine, you can access the Kinetic Fit power training app to monitor and create workouts on your smart device.","Another nice thing about the Kinetic Road Machine is that it can work with a wide range of bike types. The trainer&#39;s frame fits 22-inch to 29-inch bike wheels. It is compatible with quick release bikes, but it can also be adapted to thru-axle bikes by using the Kinetic Traxle, which must be purchased separately. Unlike the magnetic trainers which need to be adjusted manually, fluid trainers provide progressive resistance, which means that resistance will build as your cadence increases.","This bicycle trainer measures 16 x 22.4 x 32 inches and weighs 28 pounds, making it one of the heaviest trainers on our list. Being heavy is not necessarily a bad quality, as it helps ensure stability. However, storing and traveling with the Kinetic Road Machine will be more difficult than it would be with some other trainers.","Perhaps the best testament to this trainer&#39;s durability is its lifetime warranty. In the past, fluid trainers were known for leaking. Kinetic has improved its products and guarantees that this model is 100-percent leak-proof. It can be folded in half for convenient storage and travel. All of Kinetic&#39;s trainers are tested for quality before getting shipped off, so you will likely find tire marks on the cylinder.","If you want to put just a bit more money into your purchase, Kinetic offers similar trainers that have a slightly different frame and come equipped with an inRide sensor for wireless workouts that correspond with the Kinetic inRide app. They also have Bluetooth compatibility for even more smart options and programs. We are impressed with the Kinetic Road Machine. It is a simple machine that offers durability, user convenience, and versatility, and it can also be upgraded to be compatible with training apps."]},"id":"168cebfb-ecf1-4979-bb6f-e68f2fccbf1b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68562","url":"/kinetic-road-machine-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-17T15:44:16Z","datePublished":"2016-10-17T15:44:16Z","name":"Kinetic Road Machine","synopsis":"Kinetic is one of the leading bike trainer brands in the industry.
