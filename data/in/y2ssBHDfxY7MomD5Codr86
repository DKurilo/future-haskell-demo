Even with best <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-burning-software\">Blu-ray burning software</a> in hand, the discs spoiled by user or software error have a tendency to pile up. You can probably afford to spoil a few CDs now and then, since they come cheap. DVDs are a bit more expensive, and it is always a shame to lose one, but you would probably survive. Losing Blu-ray Discs, on the other hand, can be a little bit more heart wrenching. We&#39;ve compiled a few tips on how to burn Blu-ray to help you ease into the process without that eye-twitching, forehead-banging annoyance.","<strong>Make sure you have the necessary hardware.</strong><br/>DVD burners won&#39;t do for Blu. If you don&#39;t have a Blu-ray burner already, you&#39;ll need to purchase one before you can start burning. Blu-ray Discs are higher-density than DVD because they employ a higher precision blue laser to read and write data. That makes Blu-ray players backwards compatible with CD and DVD discs, but CD and DVD players can&#39;t play Blu-ray because they lack the high-precision laser.","<strong>Choose the right software.</strong> <br/>Blu-ray discs can be used for many different things, and there is a wide variety of Blu-ray burning software packages to choose from. Each one has its strengths and weaknesses. For example, if you want to burn play-ready home videos, you really don&#39;t need software with high-powered decryption support. On the other hand, decryption is everything if you want to make backup copies of your Blu-ray collection. Nothing will cause you more frustration than the discovery that your Blu-ray burning software won&#39;t do what you need.","Â ","<strong>Assemble your files before you burn</strong>. <br/>Blu-ray discs are immense, and keeping things organized is essential, especially if you are burning a data disc. We recommend that you assemble all the files you want to burn in a separate folder. This technique allows you to setup files and folders the way you want them to appear on the burned disc. Transferring everything over then becomes a simple matter of dragging and dropping.","<strong>The right disc makes all the difference.</strong> <br/>Knowing the difference between BD-R and BD-RE will save you a lot of trouble. BD-R is a write-once Blu-ray Disc, which means that you won&#39;t be able to add to the disc after the first burn. The best Blu-ray burning software packages can append BD-R discs if they have multisession support and spare room, but you&#39;ll probably have to change the default settings. Everything you burn to BD-R is permanent and can never be erased, so don&#39;t commit data to the disc until you are sure that you have everything properly set up before you start the burn. For testing purposes, use a BD-RE. These discs are rewritable. If you have a problem and burn the disc incorrectly, you can erase it and start over. This one little trick will keep entire patches of hair in your scalp where they belong.","<strong>Launch the software and burn the disc.</strong> <br/>If you&#39;ve followed steps 1-4, this one will be a piece of cake. Follow the instructions for the software you&#39;ve chosen, and in no time you&#39;ll be burning Blu-ray like a pro. These are only basic tips, but as you get more comfortable burning Blu-ray, everything else will come naturally."]},"id":"1bc8cf0e-f04a-4afa-8aab-640aa9111044","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6317","url":"/how-to-burn-blu-ray-without-pulling-your-hair-out","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"brandon-campbell","url":"/author/brandon-campbell","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Brandon Campbell","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"m6ehqkJhCK3Zk5WGBB6XT7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-07-20T14:13:58Z","datePublished":"2011-07-20T14:13:58Z","name":"How to Burn Blu-ray Without Pulling Your Hair Out","synopsis":"If you've never done any optical disc burning before, it can be frustrating.
