Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued by the manufacturer due to a safety recall. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Basis Peak activity and sleep tracker is a nice addition to your workouts if you need continuous heart rate tracking and lots of biofeedback data. This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html\">fitness tracker</a> isn&#39;t designed for casual workouts or all-day wear, as it&#39;s very bulky and less accurate than most trackers.","Although it tracks everything else, the Peak doesn’t track distance traveled. This is an odd omission since all of its competitors do. It does track steps taken, calories burned, active minutes and sleep. The continuous heart rate monitor is a great feature if you&#39;re trying to exercise in the right zone. However, if the wristband isn’t placed in the exact right position on your wrist, the device can’t track your heart rate or even recognize you are exercising. Also, if you run with your arms straight at your sides, walk while carrying something or don’t move your wrist or arm in any way, the Peak doesn’t track your data at all. All of the tracker’s accuracy scores were lower than those of other exercise trackers we tested for this reason.","The Basis Peak allows you to sets goals, but it makes you earn them. To unlock different types of goals, you must first complete the provided goals. It’s a little inconvenient to not have full control of your goals, but it’s also motivating to be required to actually meet your goals to progress. You&#39;re eventually able to set goals for steps taken, sleep, calories burned, active minutes and more. The Basis Peak has biofeedback sensors, which track your temperature and perspiration levels. Biofeedback sensors help this fitness tracker wristband accurately determine your burned calories and overall health.","The app interface is clunky but provides useful details about your activity levels. You can easily view sleep charts, heart rate charts and other helpful info about your day and progress over time. The device itself holds 30 days of history, so if you’re unable to sync with the app for a few days, your data is safe. The Basis Peak also pushes smartwatch-style notifications, so you can see your calls, texts, emails and more.","The Basis Peak only has a four day battery life because of the heart rate tracking features and large backlit screen. This is the shortest battery life span of the fitness trackers we compared. The touchscreen is a little under 1 x 1 inch, making it the largest activity tracker we tested. The screen makes it really easy to swipe between stats and information but can also be hard to read in direct sunlight. This is by far the most bulky fitness tracker we reviewed, weighing in at 50 grams.","A 12-month warranty protects the Basis Peak against malfunctions, which is just as long as most of the other trackers we reviewed. Most of the manufacturer’s help and support comes from FAQs and over email as no phone number is provided and the website doesn’t have live chat or a downloadable manual."]},"id":"04438871-b7c4-4d1c-a380-ce6e84ad3190","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b70cd15b-6d64-4eaa-94c1-fa5538014fcc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re ok with such a heavy, bulky and awkward device, the Basis Peak does a decent job recording your daily or workout stats.
