You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Grilling is usually done in bulk, so cooking for one or two people is usually a waste of gas. However, with the Master Forge Split Lid <a href=\"/best-gas-grills\">gas barbecue grill</a>, you can use the sear burner to heat up only a small section of the grill. This gas grill is exclusively sold at Lowe&#39;s, so if you don&#39;t have one by you, you&#39;ll have to order it online from Lowe&#39;s website. However, this is still one of the top ten best gas grills available.","This gas grill can create plenty of heat. The primary burners alone can generate up to 49,000 BTUs combined, which is slightly higher than most of the similar grills reviewed. Although a grill with a higher BTU level doesn&#39;t necessarily create more heat, BTUs are still a comparable specification among gas grills. The other grills we reviewed were roughly the same size and made with the same types of materials, so this grill&#39;s higher BTU rating could indicate a temperature difference. The higher BTU number also means that this grill will use more gas than the grills with lower BTU numbers.","In addition to the primary burner, the sear burner can produce 13,000 BTUs. You can use the sear burner all on its own, without firing up the rest of the grill – which will save gas. There is also a built-in side burner on the side shelf where you can simmer a sauce or sauté some onions as you grill.","The primary cooking area on this gas grill is 535 square inches, which is one of the largest primary cooking areas we found in our review. Plus, there is also an extra 168 square inches due to the warming rack. Warming racks are perfect for keeping your burgers, polish dogs or chicken hot and ready to serve once they&#39;re done cooking.","Even though this is a propane gas grill, you can convert it to use natural gas with the conversion kit sold by Lowe&#39;s (item number 50772). Natural gas is a popular way to grill because natural gas is generally cheaper than propane and it negates the need to fill up a tank, since the fuel is coming from a gas pipeline in your home.","The ceramic-coated steel of this grill is a little flimsy. It is not made of stainless steel, which is resistant to rust, so make sure to keep this grill covered when it rains. The cooking grate is made of iron and it has a porcelain coating. Iron retains heat very well, and the porcelain coating makes the grates easy to clean.","This gas grill is made exclusively for Lowe&#39;s stores. We contacted Lowe&#39;s customer service team by email and asked them some questions about the Master Forge Split Lid grill, but they didn&#39;t have all the answers we needed. In the end, we contacted a local Lowe&#39;s by phone and they were finally able to answer our questions."]},"id":"a291a591-2441-4d44-853a-f361a363beff","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f911f3d1-abb3-4461-a277-671295cd1760","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The split lid on this gas grill is a unique feature, but it doesn&#39;t make up for the shortcomings in other areas.
