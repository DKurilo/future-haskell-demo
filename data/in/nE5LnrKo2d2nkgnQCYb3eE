Unlike other <a href=\"/best-shop-vacuums\">shop vacuums</a>, it has no wheels, and the tank has a capacity of only 2.5 gallons. It handles both wet and dry pickup and comes with an assortment of attachments despite its small size. For large messes, though, you&#39;ll have trouble cleaning up everything with this vacuum.","As with all the shop vacuums we reviewed, we tested the ArmorAll with a mix of screws and mulch for dry pickup. This was the worst vacuum for picking up dry debris. It left behind large pieces and only cleaned about 55 percent of the mulch in one pass. For wet suction, it struggled. Despite having a 2.5-gallon tank, it had trouble with 2 gallons. It did suck up the water quickly, but it left some behind. This gives it the lowest wet capacity in our rankings. If you need greater cleaning power, the <a href=\"/ridgid-wd1450-review\">Ridgid WD1450</a> might be a better choice.","This is a portable shop vacuum that doesn&#39;t have wheels. You&#39;ll need to carry it around using the plastic handle on top. It&#39;s light at a little over 8 pounds, but a shoulder strap would have make it easier for you to operate. It does have a 10-foot power cord and a 6-foot hose, meaning it has good length for cleaning your entire car.","It somewhat makes up for its lack of power and capacity with a good mix of attachments. The shop vacuum comes with a floor nozzle, crevice tool, concentration tool and car nozzle, which means it can clean out every area of your vehicle. It also has a nice nozzle for using the blower function. It doesn&#39;t have an extension wand, though, so don&#39;t expect it to reach high places. The lack of an extension wand also makes it a pain to use on carpet or floors."]},"id":"4db47343-adb8-40c4-a703-68db7dba7ad3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7423f45e-aecf-42fa-a4e5-d20e7f4fe0ee","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ArmorAll AA255 is a good shop vac if your main goal is cleaning your car.
