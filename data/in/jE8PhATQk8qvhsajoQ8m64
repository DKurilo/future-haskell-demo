The ParkZone Mini Vapor is an example of one of these ultra-light RC planes that you can easily navigate in a gymnasium or large office. Take it outside and you can fly this plane in your backyard for those days when you can&#39;t make it to the park or flying field. After some serious practice, a beginner pilot can even navigate this plane in compact spaces.","The ParkZone Mini Vapor ready-to-fly (RTF) version comes fully assembled with all the gear necessary to start flying. In the box, you&#39;ll find the plane, the transmitter (or remote control), the charger, a small lithium polymer (LiPo) battery, an instruction manual and even the AA batteries for the transmitter and charger. All you have to do to start is to charge up the LiPo battery and plug it in. Once the battery is charged, you have about five to six minutes of flight time.","The ParkZone Mini Vapor sports a thin film material for the wings and tail that has an attractive red and yellow design. The fuselage rod is carbon fiber, while the wing frame is a composite of plastic and carbon. Despite weighing less than a third of an ounce, you will want to be careful about crash landing or running into things, as you could quickly damage your plane and be grounded until your replacement parts arrive. This plane needs a little lighter hand than some other RC planes. However, it is easy to get replacement parts if you need to do repairs. The ParkZone Mini Vapor has a wingspan of just under 9 inches and is just under 12 inches long. With a plane this small, you can get it into some tight spaces.","Like most electric RC planes of this size, the ParkZone Mini Vapor has a brushed  motor capable of powering even complex aerobatics. This plane is recommended for beginners and will make a great starter plane.  However, the advanced maneuvers will have to wait until after you have mastered the basic controls.","The transmitter is your standard three-channel device and is small and toy-like. The transmitter, which looks a bit like a video game controller, controls the basic movements such as throttle, elevator and rudder. Even with these basic controls, you can still perform some neat stunts with practice. The RTF packaging even comes with the AA batteries necessary for the transmitter."]},"id":"2c6195fa-c873-4712-a562-2af8c415b51d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"df2b4f44-652b-4471-8c27-0d6363f4abee","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ParkZone Mini Vapor is a great beginner RC plane and is a great way to fly indoors.
