You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","<strong>BlackBerry Bold review</strong>","The BlackBerry Bold 9000 is not destined to have the broad based appeal enjoyed by the Apple iPhone 3G but, for the mobile professional, it is likely to be the best device on the market. This is a serious communication device catering to those who need the best of email and connectivity to their other office information in an instant. Calendar, address book, and task lists are immediately available as are other selected corporate data bases.","<strong>Standout Features</strong><br/><br/>"]},"id":"611b6594-ae8a-40b3-acd0-c6bed3ec0fc9","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Features</strong>","<strong>Display</strong><br/>Let’s get the most obvious difference between the Bold and the iPhone and its myriad clones out of the way: the Bold doesn’t have a touchscreen. If you’re looking for the combination of BlackBerry features and a touchscreen your only option is the <a href=\"/blackberry-storm-9530-24219-review\">Blackberry Storm</a>. The Bold does, however, have a great screen. Its 2.75-inch display is smaller than the 3.5-inch screen on the iPhone but it does feature the same 480x320 resolution. The result is the sharpest display available on a mobile device essentially because the same number of pixels is shown on a smaller screen.","<strong>Keyboard</strong><br/>Typing on the Bold’s excellent keyboard is a treat compared to most smartphones. The design of the back-lit keys seems to meld the best features of the BlackBerry Curve and the 8800 series phones. Rows of keys are separated by a thin metal strip much like the frets on the neck of a guitar helping those of us with wide fingers to press only the intended key. Feedback is quiet and firm but not too stiff. The keyboard is topped by the familiar BlackBerry send, menu, back and end keys and the signature trackball.","<strong>Email</strong><br/>BlackBerry sets the industry standard for business and personal email versatility and accessibility. Email is pushed automatically to the device by the server so it arrives in a flash as well as conserving battery life because the phone doesn’t waste energy looking for mail. The Bold handles up to ten email accounts. There’s no need to sign in … each account has its own icon. Click it and you have immediate access to your mail.","<strong>Synchronization &amp; Sharing</strong><br/>Using the BlackBerry Enterprise Server, intended for large businesses and organizations, allows remote synchronization of the device with your server. IT departments can easily customize access and security permissions for each device and even delete all data in the event of loss or theft. BlackBerry Professional Software, for organizations with up to 30 BlackBerry users, provides similar service on a smaller scale. For individuals, the BlackBerry Internet Service is ideal. It provides most of the same features though it doesn’t support remote synchronization with your computer. Even so, synchronization with Outlook or many other Personal Information Manager (PIM) programs is simple via Bluetooth or USB cable.","Recently available BlackBerry Unite! Software allows busy families and small businesses to share files and schedules with as many as five phones and even allows for remote wiping of a lost or stolen device. BlackBerry Unite! Software is free of charge.","The Bold can be used as a tethered modem allowing internet connection for your laptop computer when Wi-Fi or high-sped landline access isn’t available.","<strong>Messaging</strong><br/>Text (SMS) and multimedia (MMS) messaging are fully supported as are popular instant messaging programs. The BlackBerry Messenger Service is also available, allowing instant communication with other BlackBerry users, worldwide, without using the wireless carriers data or text allowance.","<strong>Speed &amp; Memory</strong><br/>The heart of the Bold is a new 624 MHz Intel PXA270 processor, fully doubling the 312 MHz speed of its predecessors. Couple that with AT&amp;T’s high-speed 3G network and you can really get down to business. When you can take advantage of the integrated Wi-Fi function in conjunction with the 3G network, you can seamlessly employ both voice and data services simultaneously. The Bold’s power and multitasking prowess is further enhanced by 128 MB of Flash memory doubling that of previous BlackBerries and most other handheld devices. Included also is 1 GB of built in memory allowing for the saving of a large amount of data without the potential security problems associated with removable memory cards.","<strong>Internet &amp; Documents</strong><br/>The Bold comes equipped with the new BlackBerry OS 4.6 making it able to take full advantage of the also new BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) 2.5 which, happily, includes an improved web browser. For the first time HTML e-mail is available with all of its familiar features including embedded graphics and photos, active hyperlinks, and paragraph and font formatting. Additionally, attachments can be viewed in their native format such as MS Word, Excel, Power Point, Adobe Acrobat, and WordPerfect. Thanks to the inclusion of the DocumentsToGo program from DataViz, you can now edit Word and Power Point files, though unfortunately not Excel. If you’re willing to upgrade to the Premium Edition of DocumentsToGo, you can not only edit Excel files but also create new Word, Excel, and Power Point files.","<strong>Camera &amp; Video</strong><br/>It’s disappointing that a top end device like the Bold has a just a 2.0 megapixel camera; nonetheless, it does feature 5x digital zoom and, frankly, results in photographs that are somehow notably better than those taken by other theoretically identical cameras. White balance can be adjusted and color effects can be added. The camera will take pictures with your choice of three image qualities and sizes. With the built in GPS feature, you have the ability to geotag pictures at your fingertips. Unlike the iPhone and T-Mobile G1, the Bold has a video recorder built in. Videos can be taken on normal format or for inclusion in MMS messages. Both the video and still photo functions are made all the more enticing by the remarkable clarity of the display screen.","<strong>Music</strong><br/>The Bold caters to your mobile music collection. The media player allows eleven equalizer settings and supports virtually all music file formats. With the recent introduction of the BlackBerry Media Sync program, you can easily transfer songs from your iTunes collection to your BlackBerry. To hold all of those files you need a lot of memory and the Bold supports up to a 16 GB MicroSD/SDHC card. To listen to you tunes, the Bold is equipped with a standard 3.5mm stereo headphone jack and, better yet, supports use of Bluetooth wireless stereo headsets or speakers.  The high quality, built-in stereo speakers are also a most pleasant surprise. This is the first wireless device that I have ever found that I could actually enjoy listening to without a headset. An unexpected coincidence is that this feature makes the full duplex speaker phone much more usable.","<strong>Battery Life</strong><br/>Packed with so many features and multi-tasking functions, the Bold really needs a power-packed battery and fortunately it has one. The manufacturer estimates 270 minutes of talk time and 324 hours of standby time. If you can avoid too much battery hogging Wi-Fi use, getting through the day shouldn’t be a challenge.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>The design of the Bold is elegant if not spectacular. The generally black case with chrome trim and the rounded edges are handsome and the leather-like rear cover adds a tasteful, progressive touch. It has a substantial but comfortable feel the hand. Overall, it provides a fitting presentation for the device’s outstanding functionality.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"677932c4-24e5-4850-9cde-ecb97c09fd64","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_26568","url":"/blackberry-9000-23534-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-11-13T07:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-11-13T07:00:00Z","name":"BlackBerry Bold 9000 9000","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":57,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-05-01T16:14:23Z","id":"GnKfM2XhfX4R3yCEafkVsg","meta":{"title":"BlackBerry Bold 9000 9000 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
