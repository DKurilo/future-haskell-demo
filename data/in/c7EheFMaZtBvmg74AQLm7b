You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Crimestopper SP-600 has an animated and active LCD remote that can help you know instantly when your <a href=\"/best-car-alarms\">car alarm</a> sounds. The car alarms have a single-tone siren that will sound at the same time the notifications are sent to your remote. However, the manufacturer’s website is extremely difficult to navigate, the customer service options are limited and the user manual for Crimestopper car alarms is not posted online.","The Crimestopper car alarms have a variety of useful features including full-vehicle sensor protection. The basic door-opening sensors are just the start of the sensors available. Everything from a window being broken to the car being moved, you’ll be notified immediately with any changes to the condition of your vehicle.","The Crimestopper SP-600 car alarm remote has a small LCD screen where an image of a little car is displayed. The screen will display and highlight all the changes that are happening to your car in real time. The remote has a buzzer that will sound when your car alarm sounds. The display is clear and easy to understand.","The auto security system can also be used as a keyless entry as well as opening the trunk and starting the car. The remote start function is useful especially during times of extreme heat or cold. You can start your car and have the temperature adjusted by the time you enter the vehicle. If the key is not inserted into the ignition, the engine will die when the car is put into gear. Also, without the key in the ignition the engine will stop after a predetermined amount of time.","Because the auto security system has so many intricate features that are directly connected to the most vital parts of your car, we recommend having car alarms installed by a professional. Most automotive shops and car audio stores are able to install the system for a reasonable price, and it usually only takes a couple of hours.","The Crimestopper SP-600 has an advertized range of approximately 4,000 feet. While the range is impressive, we found it only worked at a much closer range. And while the remote is simple to read, there is a huge assortment of features and maneuvering your way through each option can be overwhelming. To add insult to injury, the manufacturer’s website is complicated and difficult to navigate.","However, the features offered by the Crimestopper car alarms work relatively well and you can trust this alarm to protect your vehicle. It will take some time to familiarize yourself with the all the available features, and we suggest utilizing the customer support options offered by the manufacturer.","The manufacturer has a few different customer service options available on the website for these car alarms. There are email addresses and a telephone support line. However, when we sent an email with questions, we never received a response. The manufacturer also offers a limited lifetime warranty."]},"id":"71e543a2-24c3-45f6-8ee6-6dd0a7510814","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9b4e186a-de13-4e40-b6be-7e105e08c0dc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Crimestopper SP-600 is an all-inclusive device with remote start capabilities as well as all the security features we looked for in the best car alarms.
