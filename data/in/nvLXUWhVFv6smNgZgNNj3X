Inside the package, you&#39;ll find a monitor, camera and the cables necessary to connect the two.","Standout features include a good-sized monitor, the widest viewing angle of the award winners in this category and a high-resolution picture that displays images in a crisp clear manner. The camera also automatically turns on when you shift into reverse, eliminating the step of switching the camera on before you hit the road.","We would have liked to see this rearview camera include wireless functionality.

Other 3.5-inch monitors top out at 480 x 320 pixels. The Safesight SC0302&#39;s display touts a higher 648 x 488 resolution.

These inputs allow you not only to hook up your rearview camera to the monitor, but also to additional video devices that connect via RCA. For example, if you have a portable media player that connects via RCA, connect it to the monitor and watch the content on your player. This opens the Safesight SC0302 up to many different functions that simply wouldn&#39;t be available if it didn&#39;t possess this connectivity.","On the back of the monitor, you will find adjustable brightness and mirror-image function buttons. These controls allow you to fine-tune the settings of the Safesight SC0302 to fit your specific needs. For example, during the daytime, you probably want to set the brightness higher since sunlight naturally dulls what you see on the screen. When the moon and stars are out, an excessively bright screen is distracting, to say the least.","As we mentioned earlier, the Safesight SC0302 automatically detects when your vehicle is in reverse and automatically activates to provide you with an image of what&#39;s behind your vehicle. Other rearview cameras have this feature, but they require you to connect the camera to the reverse lights to detect when your car shifts into reverse. The Safesight SC0302 doesn&#39;t require a trigger wire connected to the reverse light. Therefore, you don&#39;t have to worry about whether your electrician skills are up to par.","The monitor of the Safesight SC0302 is equipped with a 65-degree adjustable base. This base not only enables you to place the monitor almost anywhere on your dashboard, but also to angle it so you have a clear view of the monitor from anywhere in your cabin."]},"id":"0853b39a-08dd-4749-89d3-3734dcf458f5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"dc29186c-4746-4c43-82da-5aa642140280","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/QuQbuZ3M3zRZP4uDbMPoib.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The camera of the Safesight SC0302 measures just more than 0.75 inches by 0.94 inches.

We would like to see such a great camera include wireless functionality, but nothing is perfect.","One of the many standout features of the Safesight SC0302 is its parking-assist grid lines. Turn this feature on, and the unit will show you the exact path you need to follow for all parallel parking situations. Even when you&#39;re not parking on the street, this function helps you get a better feel for how far you are from vehicles and other objects behind you.","Safesight coats the camera portion of this backup camera with a special waterproofing compound. This waterproofing protects the camera and its sensor from damage caused by rain, snow, hail and other elements that could potentially render the unit useless.","There is only one rearview camera on our side-by-side comparison chart that has a wider viewing angle than the Safesight SC0302.
