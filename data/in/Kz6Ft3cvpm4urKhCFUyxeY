The most basic is the online platform, which is a simple, single screen for ordering trades. SogoTrader is a basic platform if you simply wish to trade stocks. If you are looking to trade stocks, options and ETFs and have a comprehensive platform with useful tools, SogoOptions is one of the best choices. It includes streaming quotes, option chains and reports for analytics. While some of SogoTrade&#39;s fees are higher than with other <a href=\"/best-online-stock-trading-brokers\">online stock trading services</a> we reviewed, it has some of the lowest trading fees, especially if you are an active trader.","With SogoTrade, there is no minimum amount for trades, so you can order a single trade and only pay the set trade fee. The fee for stock trades is $5, unless you order more than 150 trades in one quarter, in which case the $5 drops to $3, making it the cheapest for stock trades of any service on our online brokerage comparison. Options are the $5 base rate plus a $0.50 per-contract fee, which is also one of the lowest we&#39;ve seen. The $15 fee for options exercises and assignments, however, is two or three times higher than what the best online brokerage firms charge. The $25 broker-assisted fee, while not the lowest, is fairly standard.","While the platform&#39;s main focus is options, it is just as useful for trading stocks and ETFs as well. The desktop application is customizable and comes with a number of tools to monitor your watch lists, option chains and positions. The real-time ticker displays popular stocks, and you can use analytic charts, graphs and calculators to research stocks and help you decide when and what to trade. While this service offers the most popular choices for trading, it does not include trading for forex, futures or international stocks, and it lacks other investment options, such as mutual funds and bonds.","Mobile trading is also limited, as you can trade stocks and ETFs but not options. This is because there are no mobile apps, but the online trading platform is optimized for mobile browsers. While its trading choices are limited, you can still monitor orders and positions, perform research, and keep track of your watch lists.","SogoTrade&#39;s help and support is typical, with customer service by email, telephone and live chat available during normal business hours. The website provides some good resources for education, including the basics of trading, choosing a stock and margin accounts. There is also a FAQs page for the service and a glossary full of useful trading and market terms."]},"id":"71898c1b-9dd6-409f-8b22-3680bd15caee","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"50eb888e-7e40-4a11-aa83-8f942b802530","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["SogoTrade has some of the best prices for trading of any online broker we reviewed, especially when you order more than 150 trades in a single quarter.
