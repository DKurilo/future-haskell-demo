It can store up to 27 watts of power at a full charge and doesn’t require a separate battery pack for storage. There are two USB ports and a DC output for charging 12-volt batteries. It is also made of scratch-resistant and weather-resistant fabric, perfect for hiking and spending time outdoors.","The solar power kit consists of four panels that fold out into a long vertical strip. Fully folded, they take up little space in your backpack – it’s about the size of a large magazine. It also weighs only 3 pounds, which means it won’t be a burden to carry around on a long trip. It has the unique feature of not needing an external power generator – the power stores right inside the foldable panels.","The Instapark Mercury27 comes with two USB ports, allowing you to charge multiple cellphones at one time. For the 12-volt DC output, the unit offers a 5.5 mm plug, which isn’t the most convenient option. You may want to buy separate adaptors.","There isn’t a switch that stops powering the device, so you should monitor when your battery or electronics are fully charged. It would be safe to use a regulator for a car battery specifically. At 27 watts, the Instapark Mercury27 charges small devices like cellphones quickly if it’s in direct sunlight, almost as fast as you could expect from a wall socket. Of course, you won’t be using this as an actual power option like a generator. You should be plugging in your devices, charging them, and using the devices&#39; batteries after the charge is complete.","The Instapark Mercury27 is an affordable solar power kit that provides nearly unlimited power on a long trek. The included plugs should be enough for most electronic devices and its low weight and compact design make it truly portable. This solar power kit is a great accessory to include with your camping gear, but is also helpful during power outages when you may need to keep your phone charged to stay in touch with family and friends."]},"id":"42e1a98f-dbbc-4db4-af46-375fe8db9722","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61707","url":"/instapark-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-18T22:28:50Z","datePublished":"2014-12-18T22:28:50Z","name":"Instapark Mercury27","synopsis":"The Instapark Mercury27 is a portable solar power system that you can fit in your bag or backpack.
