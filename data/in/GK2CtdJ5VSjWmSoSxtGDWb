They may have started the trend, but if they could see the advancements in toast technology, they would be astonished. The Kenmore Elite, for example, has four slots that can toast bread, bagels, English muffins, croissants and waffles. Not to mention most of the frozen pastries and breads out there. This particular toaster can’t cook eggs, but the specialized settings mean perfectly toasted bread, whether thick or thin."]},"id":"f3840147-aca0-464c-a1be-966f616f18d4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"f852e8ba-9e9c-41a3-b188-a7f5cd3a94c3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore 4-Slice Toaster’s greatest quality is its control functions. The four slots are divided in half, and each side is individually controlled. This functionality is hands down the best thing since sliced bread. The dual controls mean you can cook bagels on one side and toast on the other, each at different shade settings. You can also implement the reheat and defrost settings on each side independently as well. The reheat function is simply that, a setting to keep a slice of bread or bagel warm, it will not be toasted further. The defrost setting is for any frozen breakfast bread. Simply pop a frozen waffle in the slot, push the lever down, press the defrost button, and the waffle will warm to room temperature and then begin toasting.","As previously mentioned, each side has its own shade selector – up and down arrows on new units and a control knob on older units – with a digital display. The display will illuminate to a bright blue as soon as the unit is plugged in, and the shade setting will recall its last set level. The other control settings will also illuminate blue when in use. Kenmore recommends pressing the control lever down first before hitting any of the setting buttons. At any time you can press the cancel button (labeled STOP) to end the toast cycle."]},"id":"faba2a5b-c570-4503-a5c2-ad5ac0257d53","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"ed411333-c2a4-4d6a-aa74-379ea04caf83","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Along the side of the Kenmore 4-Slice Toaster you’ll see a removable crumb tray. This tray easily slides out and can be washed with soapy water. Let it dry and then return it to the toaster before the next use. By keeping the crumb tray and the toaster carriage free of crumbs, you are prolonging the life of your toaster. Another safeguard Kenmore has built into its product is an undercarriage area to wrap the power cord up when not in use. Kenmore’s forethought in the undercarriage design makes the toaster easy to store.","Inside the toaster slots, self-adjusting bread guides will keep your bread in place for uniform toasting. Not matter where you put the bread in or how large the bread slice is, the toaster will self-center.

More impressive still is Kenmore’s five-year warranty on the toaster. They state, “If this product fails due to a defect in material or workmanship within five years from the date of purchase, return it to any Sears store or other Kenmore dealer in the United Stales for free replacement.” Most of Kenmore’s competitors only offer a one-year warranty, but Kenmore’s five-year warranty speaks to their confidence in the product – a strong reassurance for the customer."]},"id":"a7734722-43a6-4341-b225-62f1c44e555d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fbae9752-9a2f-430e-9e29-cb6381725918","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore 135308 is a fabulous choice for a new toaster.
