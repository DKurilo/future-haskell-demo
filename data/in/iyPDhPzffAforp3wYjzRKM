Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Holstein Housewares HF-09004M <a href=\"/best-donut-makers\">electric donut maker</a> is sleek and compact, capable of cooking six donuts in a single batch. It boasts numerous safety features and a quick cooking time, but it fails to perform up to par with some of the best donut makers in our lineup.","This donut maker provides fresh-baked mini-donuts in just minutes. In our tests, it took two minutes and 45 seconds for the unit to heat up, and a batch took just over two minutes to cook.  Unfortunately, the evenness of the cooked donuts leaves a bit to be desired, and removal of the cooked products from the non-stick surface proved messy. For best results, we suggest spraying a thin coat of vegetable oil to the cooking surface to ensure more easy release.","As far as safety features are concerned, the Holstein Housewares HF-09004M has it all: cool touch handles that prevent accidental burns during cooking, non-skid rubber feet that ensure it’s not easy to knock off your kitchen countertop, and a locking lid latch that keeps the contents inside in the event the unit hits the floor. It also includes safe and easy cord storage.","This home donut machine includes a user guide with a total of nine different homemade donut recipes, which represents the greatest number of recipes provided by any of the models we tested. Aside from the donut maker itself, this is all that comes included in the package and there are no additional accessories provided.","Although you get useful technical support channels through email and telephone, the manufacturer warranty for this donut maker is only 180 days. The typical length of warranties for home donut makers is one year, which means you get a significantly shorter period of coverage against defects."]},"id":"4d857d29-800e-4178-973d-e646c2055c40","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3bef6e31-034b-4639-8335-facd4de1b09f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Holstein Housewares HF-09004M donut maker is among the highest rated models we reviewed in the area of safety features, but it performed poorly with respect to overall cleanup time.

You can contact customer service via email or phone if you have questions or need to troubleshoot issues.
