The original review is below, but check out our current lineup about <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">3D Printers</a> here.</em>","The Mega Prusa is a large-scale, acrylic machine with a 3D printer kit option. Its smaller counterpart, the Classic Prusa, is a reliable machine with included software and a medium-size print plate. Both are designed for PLA 3D printing and are compatible with many different operating systems.","The Mega Prusa has the capacity for large 3D designs and prints. With a print area for objects up to 11 x 10 x 8 inches, you won&#39;t have to scale down or slice your large objects to fit on a small print plate. Speed and resolution are not quite up to par with the best 3D printers, though. Each layer prints at 38 mm per second and is about 0.35 mm tall, which is not as good as the 0.1 mm resolution of other 3D printers we compared.","PLA filament is the only 3d printing material supported by the Classic and Mega Prusa machines, as there is no heated platform for ABS printing. 3D Stuffmaker sells filament cartridges for $48 each, or you can use any generic 3 mm PLA cartridge from another retailer. Unfortunately, neither machine has multiple heads, so you can only print with one color at a time.","The Classic Prusa is a smaller machine made of acrylic and weighs only 24 pounds. The Mega Prusa is just that: mega. It, too, is made of acrylic, but it weighs a whopping 105 pounds; make sure you have help moving it and enough desk space to dedicate. Both 3D printers also come in DIY kit options, so if you like to tinker, those might be a more challenging option for advanced creators. Absent features from both machines include LCD screens, heated platforms and housing enclosures.","Whatever computer you have at home or in the office, the Classic Prusa and the Mega Prusa won&#39;t have any trouble connecting. Windows 8, 7, Vista and XP along with Mac and Linux operating systems will all work. You do have to print from the USB cable, though: No Wifi or SD card printing here.","When looking for support for your Mega or Classic Prusa, the 3D Stuffmaker website has a few different options. Email and phone support are both convenient, and there are also online manuals, a blog and tutorials to walk you through the software. Another standout support feature is online chat; 3D Stuffmaker is the only 3D printing company we&#39;ve compared with live chat on its website. Although it&#39;s easy to contact 3D Stuffmaker, there is no warranty covering either of the Prusa printers.","When looking to buy a 3D printer, look to see what&#39;s included. Nothing is worse than getting a toy and not having batteries. The Classic and Mega Prusa printers come with a CD that has the 3D printing software and maintenance tools for your printer and printed objects. However, there is no USB cable or power supply provided. You&#39;ll need to find and purchase a 12v and 5amp power supply on your own. Also, neither printer comes with a starter cartridge of filament; you&#39;ll need to supply this as well."]},"id":"b4b559d2-7184-4bc2-8a15-dc502e8542d6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ae8a1d4f-4d76-443a-8496-8bf698ad84bd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Mega Prusa is one of the largest 3D printers on our lineup, and the open design of the printer itself makes 3D printing easy and fun to watch.
