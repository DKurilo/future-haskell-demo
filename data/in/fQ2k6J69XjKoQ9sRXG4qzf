The original review is below, but check out our current site about </em><a href=\"/best-health-insurance-providers\"><em>Health Insurance</em></a><em> here.</em>","Coventry Health Care is a relatively young <a href=\"/best-health-insurance-providers\">health insurance</a> provider, but it is worth a look if you live in one of the 22 states in which it offers coverage. The company has a large assortment of low-cost health insurance that could suit people in many demographics.","This is not the company you want if you are looking for a one-stop shop. We saw health plans and health plans only on its website. There is no sign of life, dental, vision or other types of insurance. Many of the companies we considered allowed you to piggyback those other kinds of insurance, and we prefer companies that have that option. The Coventry health plan selection is impressive, though, and it includes the option of health savings account plans. Those can be nice if you want a little more control over what you spend on health care. You can set some money aside throughout the year to apply to deductibles or other upcoming health expenses.","In terms of individual health insurance plans, we were impressed by the sheer quantity. We found a plan priced at only $55.92 a month, but we would go with something more like CoventryOne Plan 14A. For a little more than $100 a month, you get coverage for most major medical expenses. We were not overly impressed with the percentages, though. You have to pay up to 50 percent of the cost for some services, including in-network surgery. That seems steep when other plans in that price range cover up to 80 percent on similar procedures.","What we found for family plans is largely the same story â€“ quantity but not always the best quality. The best bet is probably the CoventryOne Plan 23A, which costs $416.13 per month. It will cover 70 percent of most medical bills. That&#39;s a decent deal, but we saw better prices from other providers.","The Coventry site is pretty easy to use, but more plan details would have been helpful in some cases. If you have questions, customer service representatives are available by phone and email."]},"id":"9b9ea971-a516-493a-b54f-2940f9b2ef38","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7c343b9f-1685-43d5-9c23-569fd110ae7e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Coventry does not offer an easy way to add life, dental, vision or other types of insurance, but the company does have some decent coverage for major medical insurance.
