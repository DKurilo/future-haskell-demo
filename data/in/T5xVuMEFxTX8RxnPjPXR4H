Membership is completely free and sellers can list their items for free. The only fee for sellers is a final value fee, which is a post-transaction fee determined by how much your auctioned items sell for. Any item sold for under $100 has a 3.9% final value fee. The final value fee percentage gets lower as the final selling price increases. An item sold for over $1,000 has a final value fee of $28.40 plus an additional 1.5% of the sale price over the value of $1,000, with a maximum fee of $99.","Additional fees will also be charged for implementing attention getters for your auctions. Featuring your auction on the front page costs $9.95 or you can feature the item under a specific category for $4.95. Bold and highlighted listings cost 95¢ and $1.95, respectively.","While listing is completely free, if your item doesn’t sell and you want to relist the auction for another 60 days automatically, you pay 2¢. Closing an auction early, after bids have been placed, costs $3.
