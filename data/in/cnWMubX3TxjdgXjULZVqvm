The DVDFab software is equipped with a dynamic internal parser that can remove all intrinsic copy protections and region codes found on commercially-produced Blu-ray discs or DVDs. The software is continually updated to ensure it can circumvent even the newest copy protections on the market.","The software also has all the typical features one would expect from a Blu-ray to DVD converter software program including multi-language support (for audio output and subtitles), real-time preview of the converted file(s) and a splitter function. It is important to note for the sake of conciseness and speed the preview of the video does not display the same quality that the converted video in its entirety will. The splitter function is especially nice if you want to merge certain segments of a BD into a DVD that will play continuously (like copying multiple episodes of a television show from a BD).","Finally, we really like that the software also supports Blu-ray to Blu-ray cloning, making perfect 1:1 copies and even compressing BD-50 to BD-25, BD-9 or BD-5. Not only can you make copies that will play on regular DVD players, you can also make actual Blu-ray copies in case the original BD you purchased is ever damaged or lost. Additionally, the software supports a wide range of output DVD media including DVD+R/RW, DVD-R/RW, DVD-R DL and DVD+R DL for both DVD-5 and DVD-9 mediums. If you don&#39;t have a tangible disc on hand, you can save the converted video on your hard drive as a Blu-ray folder, a DVD folder or an ISO image file for later burning."]},"id":"c577c110-d6ae-46b4-bd56-b48cf64fdae8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Conversion Features"},"id":"431be2b8-c51a-4712-a933-57f38d91eda7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There&#39;s little doubt this Blu-ray to DVD converter software reigns supreme when it comes to the quality of its output files.
