With a 93dB sensitivity rating, the 12-inch car subwoofer is one of the most efficient subwoofers on the market. This means that if you sit 1 meter from the subwoofer and use 1 watt of power, the sub produces 93dB of volume output. This is significant because every 3dB increase in sensitivity means that the subwoofer only needs half the power to produce the same output.

The 1,400-watt peak power handling is among the highest, which means that it can handle a lot more power in brief spikes than most car subwoofers.
