This kind of baseboard heater is ideal for areas of your home where a standard baseboard unit won’t work, such as under a kitchen sink, in a small bathroom, on a stairway or in a hallway.","This kind of heater is installed directly into the wall along the baseboard area, but often is installed on the bottom of a wall without a baseboard. For instance, these units can be easily installed underneath cabinets in kitchens or bathrooms.","The Broan baseboard space heater has a much lower-profile design than standard baseboard heaters have, and basically just looks like any other heat vent would in a home. The grate can sit flush with a wall or cabinet as long as there is space for the back of the heater.","This kind of baseboard heater is not recommended as a sole heating source for a home, but as an additional source of heat in certain areas of your home. You don’t need a wall thermostat with this kind of baseboard heater because the controls are on the unit itself.","This baseboard heater can provide heat in a matter of seconds. Due to its efficient steel-sheathed and plate-finned heating element, there is no waiting time when the unit is turned on before it starts providing heat.","This unit comes wired at 1,500 watts and 240 volts. However, the unit can be converted to 750 watts and 120 volts if you want.","This baseboard heater runs quietly, and disperses heat from the baseboard to the entire room quickly. For safety, the unit will automatically shut off in the event of overheating.","The Broan Trimline Kickspace baseboard space heater is an excellent option if you are looking for a secondary heating source in certain areas of your home. Its size and low-profile design keeps it out of the way and provides the baseboard heat you are looking for. It’s a great option for adding extra heat to a kitchen area, a bathroom or another small room."]},"id":"49df1935-4edc-47ea-b5d6-74d80210734c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59233","url":"/broan-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-03-27T03:46:06Z","datePublished":"2014-03-27T03:46:06Z","name":"Broan 112","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
