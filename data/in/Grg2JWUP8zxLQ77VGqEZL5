This service claims to cover over 750,000 vehicles and to have paid over $1 billion in claims. While there are certainly some appealing aspects to the plans CarShield offers, the service did not perform well in my quote process evaluations and the customer service failed to respond to my requests for more information.","The quote process is the service&#39;s first impression. And this is where CarShield falters the most. I submitted quotes for multiple vehicles and didn&#39;t get the necessary information for over a week and a half to get a quote. Admittedly, this is partly because I was trying to convince the service to email the quotes rather than call me back. CarShield&#39;s entire quoting process is designed to get you into a sales call. This is not dissimilar to most <a href=\"/best-extended-car-warranty-services\">extended car warranty brokers</a>, except the service would not respond to my requests to have the quote emailed. None of the emails I sent to support were answered. Eventually, I relented and talked to a salesperson to get the quote.","The reason for the email preference is simple â€“ it allows you to look over and consider the details of the quote without the pressure of making a purchase, and it makes it easy to compare with other services. If the quote has sufficient value, you&#39;re motivated to purchase. When a company forces you into a conversation with a salesperson, it suggests the product or service lacks sufficient value on its own merits and you need to be convinced to buy it. This is a red flag.","Once I relented and talked to a salesperson to get a quote, the average cost per mile covered was at $0.04. This was average. Neither expensive or cheap. By comparison, <a href=\"/autopom-review\">Autopom</a> averaged about $0.01 per mile covered for the same vehicles.","CarShield sells the most vehicle service plans and has the least restrictive mileage limits. With over 30 plans and a 300,000-mile limit, this service gives you the best option at finding a vehicle service contract to fit your budget and coverage needs. In fact, the service boasts of having a plan to fit &#34;every budget and lifestyle.&#34; It&#39;s also the only service to offer motorcycle plans and the only service to provide reviewable contracts in Spanish.","The average length of the contracts is very good, receiving an A in our comparison. With over 30 contracts of varying lengths, the average length is about 14 pages. While this is longer than most service vehicle contracts, these contracts average just 452 words per page, making them much easier to read. In fact, the estimated word count is about 6,500 words per contract. By comparison, <a href=\"/endurance-review\">Endurance&#39;s</a> contracts are shorter but have 1,080 words per page for an average length of 9,700 words per contract. Since reading the contracts is critical before you sign, this is not an insignificant comparison.","CarShield has so many coverage options and so few restrictions, you&#39;re more likely to find a plan to cover your car, even if it has a lot of miles, than with other services. However, the service is not set up for quick and easy quotes, requiring you instead to talk to a salesperson."]},"id":"8f5eb981-a532-43ba-853f-2996fea5ee91","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70215","url":"/carshield-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-10T14:07:00Z","datePublished":"2018-09-10T14:07:00Z","name":"CarShield","synopsis":"CarShield is a vehicle service plan broker with over 30 plans, flexible payment terms and few restrictions.
