This program provides a special focus on organization. Once opened, it starts by providing you with a visual representation of your storage system then it shows you your drive’s fragmented sectors so that you know exactly what needs to be done.","A simple visual display presents you with several options for your first defragmentation scan. If you want quick results, you can choose a light scan that corrects the largest issues first. And just like <a href=\"https://software/utilities/best-disk-defragmenter-software/defraggler-review/\">Defraggler</a>, Auslogics Disk Defrag also lets you opt for a targeted defragging option, which lets you clean up just the hard drive and individual files.","This software also offers scans designed to optimize system performance. These include boot time defrags, disk analysis and cleanup. It can also place system files so that it’s easier for the hard drive to access them. These scans take longer than regular disk defrag scans, and Auslogics recommends scanning your computer no more than once a week. You may not even to run the software that often if you rarely use your computer or download new files.","According to the company, it generally takes about 10 minutes to defragment the average hard drive. If you want to leave your computer on during the process, you can select an option that automatically shuts your computer down once the defrag finishes. For ongoing protection, turn on the idle function to allow the disk defragmenter to scan and repair your system anytime the computer goes idle. You can also set a regular time for the defrag program to run on your computer, such as the first of every month at midnight.","The visual interface shows you problem sectors on your hard drive. If you prefer a little customization, or simply want different colors to indicate good, bad or repairing sectors, you can choose the ones you like. You also have the option to target specific sectors, or you can set the program to work only on fragments of a particular size. You can also exclude specific drives or files. On the flip side, if there is a specific file or folder you want to defrag, you can select just that one.","Auslogics’ defragmenting software doesn’t include optimization features for solid-state drives. You can install it on any system running Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10. If you want to use this defrag application on a machine with Windows XP or Vista, you’ll need a 32-bit operating system and updated service packs."]},"id":"72694e75-34d9-41ac-8fa9-ed0e6435fe86","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68061","url":"/auslogics-disk-defrag-free-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-29T21:20:27Z","datePublished":"2016-06-29T21:20:27Z","name":"Auslogics Disk Defrag 8.0.10.0","synopsis":"The disk defragmentation software application from Auslogics provides basic system maintenance on Windows PCs.
