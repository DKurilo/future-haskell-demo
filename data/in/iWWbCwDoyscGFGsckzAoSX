During our testing, we fried decent chicken strips and French fries with little fuss, but our taste testing panel gave them below average scores. We also ended up with a lot of oil on the countertop, although the machine itself is a snap to clean.","Our timer showed it took 15 minutes for this 1,500-watt electric <a href=\"/best-deep-fryers\">deep fryer</a> to come to temperature, and it recovered its temperature about five minutes after we added food – both times are on the higher end. The GranPappy doesn’t have an adjustable thermostat because it only has one temperature setting. This small deep fryer holds about 1.4 liters of oil, and you can fry about 3.1 pounds of food per batch.","Instead of a frying basket, this model comes with a slotted scoop to lift out your food once it&#39;s done. There aren&#39;t any indicator lights to let you know the fryer is on or when it reaches its maximum cooking temperature.","This deep fryer also doesn’t include a timer, a shield to prevent oil from splattering out or an oil drain. The GranPappy comes with a lid you can snap over the fryer to avoid spills and keep oil fresh for the next use. However, be sure the unit has cooled completely before attaching the lid. There is also a convenient handle you can use to lift and move the deep fryer to store it.","Unlike many other deep fryers, Presto doesn&#39;t insulate the GranPappy’s exterior, so the outside aluminum container can get extremely hot when it&#39;s plugged in. It reached 360 degrees Fahrenheit – the highest of any model we reviewed. If you accidentally touch the sides, you could get seriously burned. Likewise, because it doesn&#39;t include a shield to prevent oil splatter, we found we needed to be cautious when submerging food in oil. If you have small children and safety features are a high priority, you might find the <a href=\"/delonghi-review\">DeLonghi Cool Touch Deep Fryer D677UX</a> more to your liking. The DeLonghi’s exterior temperature stays around a somewhat-safer 101 degrees Fahrenheit, although you should always use great caution when using any deep fryer when children are present.","The GranPappy comes with a magnetic cord you can quickly pull to shut off power to the unit in the event of an emergency, which is a nice safety feature. It also has skid-resistant feet to keep it from sliding across your countertop or onto the floor.","Without some of the common features other fryers include, such as a metal mesh basket, there aren&#39;t a lot of parts to clean. As such, this electric deep fryer was easier to clean than the other models we tested. Presto includes a two-year warranty, which is a year longer than the industry standard."]},"id":"d7eee312-2d4c-4608-a4a2-94918bef3c73","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67442","url":"/presto-granpappy-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-11-19T16:16:24Z","datePublished":"2015-11-19T16:16:24Z","name":"Presto GranPappy 5411","synopsis":"The Presto GranPappy is a simple fryer consisting of a black, heavy-duty cast aluminum bucket as well as a lid, a handle and a scoop for removing food.
