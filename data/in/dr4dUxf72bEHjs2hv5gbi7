Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The peace of mind you add to your travels with any <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> unit is all present and accounted for with Magellan Maestro 4350. This navigation GPS unit will help you get to anywhere, from anywhere, and is loaded with pre-programmed points of interest, just like one would expect from high quality navigation GPS units.","Some of the things that set this product apart are ease-of-use extras like the OneTouch feature. This helps you program in your favorite spots – banks, businesses, restaurants – so the navigation GPS location can be recalled quickly. One quick touch and you will be guided to your favorite coffee shop, for example, no matter where you are at the time the craving strikes you.","Another thing that adds to ease of use is Bluetooth compatibility. You don&#39;t have to worry about taking your hands off the wheel to deal with a ringing phone when you are trying to use your navigation GPS unit to find an address. Compatible phones will integrate with Magellan Maestro 4350 so you can do both tasks safely.","This unit gives you turn by turn directions like all competitors, but it also makes it easy to find your way once you have parked the car with its Pedestrian mode.","Many GPS units include 3D elements but this one makes 3D buildings look more realistic and less cartoonish than the other ones we reviewed. It makes the buildings much easier to recognize. This will be especially helpful if you are in an unfamiliar city and all the buildings have started to look identical.","This navigation GPS unit comes with access to an impressive count of points of interest – 6 million to be exact. Things like restaurants, ATMs and coffee shops are all searchable by name or category, from wherever you find yourself. Thankfully there is no need to know the exact spelling for any of these, either; this unit will auto-complete your search entries and re-spell them for you, if needed.","Magellan Maestro 4350 offers features that can help you deal with every driver&#39;s common enemy: traffic. The Live Traffic element can offer real-time information about accidents, road closures, weather closures and more. The navigation GPS unit also has lane guidance for highway driving. This helps you know which lane is best when you are coming up on an intersection, so you can concentrate on moving safely around other cars instead of concentrating on signs so much.","You can also take some tunes along to make the journey more pleasant because this unit offers an integrated MP3 player. And if you happen to get too revved up on a Metallica tune, the unit will warn you with an over-the-speed limit alert."]},"id":"036875cf-c5f9-494e-8d90-8824e79b0852","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ca08d78d-97b4-45d5-9ea5-2edf4a0a892a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This unit falls a little short comparatively in terms of screen size and battery life.
