This <a href=\"/best-air-miles-credit-cards\">air miles credit card</a> also offers you a $100 statement credit just for making your first purchase with the card.","You can enjoy several enviable travel benefits with this mileage credit card, including priority boarding and access to United’s VIP airport lounges. Chase also offers card members free bag check and the ability to use miles on international flights. However, you may run into some blackout dates when booking travel with your points, and you can’t get in-flight discounts. You&#39;re also not given an annual airline allowance.","When you use your United MileagePlus® Club Card to purchase your travel fare, you automatically receive travel accident insurance, rental car insurance and lost luggage reimbursement. Additionally, this card includes 24/7 roadside assistance, purchase protection and zero liability.","This card doesn’t offer an introductory annual percentage rate for new card members. Its standard APR is respectable; on purchases and balance transfer transactions, you can expect a 15.24% Variable APR. If you use this card to make a cash advance, your APR is 19.24% Variable. If you make a late payment, there&#39;s a steep 29.99% Variable penalty APR attached to this card.","This card’s annual fee is much higher than all of the other travel miles credit cards we reviewed. In fact, at $395, this annual fee is nearly four times more expensive than the best frequent flyer credit cards we reviewed. The other fees attached to this air miles credit card are standard compared to other credit cards.","For cash advance transactions, you should plan to see a minimum $10 or 3% fee attached, while a minimum $5 or 3% fee is associated with every balance transfer transaction you make. If you use this card for purchases overseas, you’re in luck as it doesn&#39;t charge you a fee on international purchases.","Chase can be contacted for member support by either phone or by sending an email through your online account. You can also reference the frequently asked questions on its website if you have general questions about your account or card benefits."]},"id":"3ce4cc78-6b61-4cba-944f-76049009f7cf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"47bde2cd-a0ea-49a8-9a27-43a958bcb283","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The United MileagePlus® Club Card has a very high annual fee but includes many travel benefits.
