The original review is below, but check out our current top</em><i> </i><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/electronics/gps/best-navigation-gps/\"><em>Navigation GPS</em></a><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The TomTom Go 50 is a navigation GPS with lifetime map updates and a 5-inch screen. It comes preloaded with a map of the United Sates. Unlike some of the best navigation GPS units, the Go 50 does not have lifetime traffic updates. It does, however, come with a three-month trial period of traffic updates, after which point you&#39;ll have to pay a monthly fee. TomTom Traffic works by pairing your smartphone with the GPS, and then the GPS calculates your fastest route based on traffic.","One notable feature missing from this affordable car GPS is voice-activated navigation, which would allow you to verbally command the GPS. However, we didn&#39;t review any GPS units anywhere near this price point that had that functionality, so we didn&#39;t expect to see it on this model.","The Go 50 has TomTom&#39;s built-in 7 million points of interests, which allows you to find gas stations, hotels, restaurants and more. One of its best features is its lane assistance. This helps you get into the correct lane as you near a turn. However, it doesn&#39;t have the easy-to-read 3D maps that some of the premium models offer.","It also has a speed limit indicator, so you&#39;ll see the speed limit of the road you&#39;re traveling on, as well as your current rate of speed. This could easily help you avoid a speeding ticket on an unfamiliar road. Like most modern GPS units, the Go 50 also has automatic rerouting, so if you make a wrong turn, it recalculates and directs you to the new fastest route.","The device has a 5-inch plastic touchscreen. This screen is resistive, not capacitive, so it isn&#39;t nearly as responsive as the screen on your smartphone.","The entire unit is less than an inch thick, and it draws power from your cigarette lighter outlet. Once unplugged, its onboard battery allows it to run for about two hours.","TomTom has phone, email and social media support options. It offers a one-year warranty on the Go 50."]},"id":"ab835fd8-9279-4b28-a0ad-3a8ebe073cfe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"abab6504-61a0-4c46-abbc-fe160e1ff09c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The TomTom Go 50 is undoubtedly a barebones car GPS.
