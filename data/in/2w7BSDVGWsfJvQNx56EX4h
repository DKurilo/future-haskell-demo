You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Magimix Vision is a unique toaster. It is a single slot <a href=\"/best-toasters\">toaster</a> with a viewing port. You can view the toast throughout the toasting cycle and monitor the browning in real time without pausing the toaster. This definitely makes the toasting process more of an interactive experience. You may press the cancel button when you feel the bread has reached the proper browning level. The toaster, like others we reviewed, does include preset shade settings so you can use it like a standard toaster too.","One feature the Magimix Vision toaster doesn&#39;t include is high-lift. High-lift raises bread out of the toasting slot for easier retrieval. With this toaster, you may need to use tongs to retrieve smaller breads, like English muffins. The toaster does have a reheat function. This is something found on the best toasters we reviewed. The reheat function will take cold toast and heat it for thirty seconds without browning it further. This gives you hot bread when you want it.","The single-slot design does limit the amount of bread you can toast in a single toasting cycle. The toaster can fit two loaf-size slices of bread at once, and it’s wide enough to accommodate a bagel. The long slot does allow you to toast longer artisan breads, as well.","The stainless steel design of the Magimix Vision complements the modern look of the viewing port. This toaster will add to the aesthetic design of your kitchen and be a conversation piece. The storage elements of this toaster are a bit lacking. It weighs 8.5 pounds, which makes it slightly cumbersome to carry. There is no hideaway cord feature that would let you wrap the cord out of sight when not in use. This means you must wrap the cord around the toaster or have it dangle during storage.","The cleanup features are great. The removable crumb tray let you clean out the toaster without turning it upside down and shaking out the waste. The viewing glass also slides out so you can clean both sides easily. The toaster doesn&#39;t include cool-touch sides, so it would be possible to burn yourself if you accidently touch the toaster&#39;s side while it’s hot.","The customer support for Magimix is good. It just isn&#39;t in English. Magimix is a French company and the support is in French. There is an email form on the website for questions you may have. There’s also a support telephone number for the company’s French customers. The Magimix Vision does come with a generous three-year warranty. A standard warranty for a toaster is one year."]},"id":"e11e6f70-367d-41fb-92a6-69c6b8faade7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0543bf19-c651-4209-a1c0-1edc948798cf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Magimix Vision is a unique toaster.
