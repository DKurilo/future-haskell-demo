You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Internally and externally, the Celluon PicoPro shares the profile of other <a href=\"/best-mini-projectors\">mini portable projectors</a> that emphasize portability. It sports dimensions of 5.9 x 2.9 x 0.5 inches and a weight of 0.43 pounds. In your hands, its design is slightly odd, but it doesn’t feel much bulkier or larger than a typical large-screen smartphone.","As with most mini portable projectors, the PicoPro doesn’t have the deepest bench of connectivity options. Sound output for the Celluon comes from a weak single speaker, and we found its performance to be tinny and lackluster. Support for Miracast wireless streaming allows you to mirror tablets and other devices on the projector, and we found it extremely easy to set up.","On the back of the projector, available ports include a Micro-USB slot for charging, a 3.5mm audio jack and a Micro-HDMI port for video output. While the port helps maintain the PicoPro’s slim profile, the mini projector inconveniently doesn’t come with either a Micro-HDMI cable or convertor. Consequently, you have to purchase a cable from a third-party seller to use an HDMI device.","In our hands-on testing, we found the PicoPro to be a sharp, if slightly limited, projection option. Thanks to its laser-based projection hardware, it did excellently in our performance benchmarking and produced a color accuracy score of 8.9. For reference, the closer a projector’s score is to zero, the more accurately it reproduces a full spectrum of colors. In our dimmed-room testing with videos, we found that the projector produced sharp colors that popped from the display. The projector also put up an excellent mark of two hours and 25 minutes in our battery testing.","With the PicoPro’s low projection angle, though, positioning the projector can be tricky in situations where space is limited. While the projector comes with an elevated cradle, it’s not the most elegant solution when using it for a large audience. The PicoPro’s low-brightness hardware ran into similar struggles during our evaluations. With a manufacturer rating of only 32 lumens, the projector was limited in environments with ambient light. In a daytime environment with no direct sunlight, the PicoPro’s image was washed out and difficult to see."]},"id":"600b0e0c-6726-4466-a0b3-c72df839894b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d998807a-6759-4d3a-9b7b-ac431b94f44d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While it’s not without its limitations compared to the best mini projectors, the Celluon PicoPro still has much to offer home users.
