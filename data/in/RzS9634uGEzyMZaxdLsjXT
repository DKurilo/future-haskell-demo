This program is all online, so you don&#39;t have to worry about long downloads or physical software discs. You can test your English with just an internet connection. However, this program isn&#39;t designed for beginners to English learning. It is for learners who already understand the basics of the English language and want to test and stretch their skills.","The main focus of this English learning program is to test how well you understand the English language and in what areas you can improve. It starts with a basic checkup. This is simply an assessment of where you are in learning the English language and what skills you lack or could improve.","After you take the test, you receive your results in a few hours. It can take up to 24 hours to receive test results because the company works to ensure they are accurate. With the paid version of this English learning software, you receive a detailed analysis of how well you understand the English language and where you need to improve to communicate better. The company recommends you take a test every two weeks to see how well you improve.","This application is a little different from many English learning programs. It doesn&#39;t provide structured lesson plans you must follow. However, that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t offer English learning assistance. Instead, you can practice your English with articles, videos and daily tips available on the company website. Because of the lack of structured lessons, you will not progress or understand much unless you have a basic understanding of English. This English learning application is best for someone who has been studying the English language elsewhere for quite some time.","On the website, you can find a learning resource section. This section of the website provides resources and links to help you improve in a myriad of areas in the English language. You can also read the company&#39;s Get Fluent blog to learn even more and become more familiar with such a difficult language.","FluentIQ has FAQs on the company website if you do have any questions about this program. The website is also where you can access all of the learning resources the company provides. If you need assistance with anything, you can contact representatives via email.","FluentIQ differs from many other learning English programs because it isn&#39;t structured and doesn&#39;t provide detailed lessons. It still provides numerous learning resources to help you become a more fluent speaker, but this program is best for taking the test to find out where you stand with your English skills and where you need to improve."]},"id":"9247356c-e09e-4574-960d-952f9f0c86d6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68453","url":"/fluentiq-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-26T14:58:02Z","datePublished":"2016-09-26T14:58:02Z","name":"FluentIQ","synopsis":"FluentIQ is an online English learning application designed to help you master the English language.
