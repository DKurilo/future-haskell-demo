You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Remington Hyper Series XR1330K is a <a href=\"/best-electric-razors\">rotary shaver</a> that has a handful of convenient features, including a precision trimmer, a corded option and a battery indicator. You can clean it under tap water, which is convenient for cleaning it quickly, but it doesn&#39;t have a cleaning station for more thorough washing.","You can use this electric razor to shave wet or dry facial hair. It runs for 40 minutes on a full charge before you need to recharge it, which is slightly less than average, as many shavers run for 45 minutes or more.","In our testing, this electric razor didn&#39;t provide the smoothest shave, and it irritated the face quite a bit too. After shaving, there was some stubble left, and the shave was pretty rough overall.","We also found that in order to get a close shave, it took more effort than we thought it would, and we had to make a lot of passes over the same areas. Additionally, the built-in precision trimmer pulled a lot at the hair and was a bit awkward to use.","We were disappointed to see that the razor had no quick-charge option. A quick-charge option allows you to charge it for just five minutes in order to get enough battery power for one shave. We also dislike that it takes so long to recharge – four hours to get a full battery when it&#39;s dead, which is substantially more than the majority of razors take.","This electric razor does have a charging dock, which helps, but we were disappointed to not see a cleaning station and a travel pouch included. The best electric razors come with both a charging dock and a cleaning station. The cleaning station makes it easy to give your razor a more thorough wash overall than cleaning it under tap water after each shave.","The unit measures 5.8 inches long and 3 inches in width and depth, which is pretty standard for an electric razor. It weighs 0.75 pounds, which is fairly light. We found that the unit had a normal feel and weight to it during our testing, and the controls are easy to access.","The electric razor is covered under a two-year warranty. This length of warranty is standard for electric razors. Remington doesn&#39;t provide FAQs for this razor on its website, but the company is available by phone and email."]},"id":"63935afe-31e3-499e-9dc4-6c2687cc42bf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ecd8ec0d-99c4-4ba7-a264-29d3d4b203a9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Remington Hyper Series XR1330K rotary electric shaver for men has some good features, but it does lack a few standard features most electric razors have, such as a cleaning station.
