This <a href=\"/best-photo-editing-software\">photo retouching software</a> features a full-service cosmetic makeover feature, facial reshaping and some basic photo editing settings to help you make the perfect picture. It also positions your before and after photos side by side to help you see just how much you&#39;ve edited your photo.","This menu-driven photo manipulation software is easy to use and includes templates with preset effects to make the retouching process smoother and more enjoyable. Using this software, you can perform all the basic retouching processes, including removing red eye, evening out skin tones, removing blemishes, brightening eyes and whitening teeth.","While other competing applications apply a flat softening effect, FaceFilter3 analyzes the contours of a person&#39;s face and uses highlights and shadows to provide a more natural look. As you edit, you can choose to position the original photo next to the image with your adjustments. This is a great feature, as it lets you see how much you have improved the photo, or how far off you may be.","This photo retouching software comes with a makeup-artist-inspired cosmetic system. With this tool, you can enhance your model&#39;s original makeup, or you can completely add eye shadow, eyelashes, blush, lipstick, concealer and more. The contact lens tool allows you to change a person&#39;s eye color and adjust the color settings to your liking. Each cosmetic tool comes with templates to view and make quick adjustments. The tools and features are completely customizable by using the sliders to manipulate your photo to perfection.","Furthermore, this photo editing software employs facial reshaping technology. You can apply one-click effects or manually adjust smile, chin width and eye size. This feature is one solution for grumpy children, adults who never smile or for self-conscious subjects.","You can contact Reallusion by email, but, unfortunately, you have to log in as a member to submit your questions. However, there are plenty of resources on the company&#39;s website, including tutorials, a user manual, FAQs and a forum.","With this photo editing software, you can add just a few minor touches to your images or give your subject a complete makeover. If you are looking for a photo retouching program that allows you to completely change the shape of your model&#39;s face, add makeup and adjust basic photo settings, FaceFilter3 is worth considering."]},"id":"51ffac5b-78f0-41fd-97dd-6bafcc58fff0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55577","url":"/facefilter-studio-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-12-15T02:57:20Z","datePublished":"2012-12-15T02:57:20Z","name":"FaceFilter3","synopsis":"With FaceFilter3 from Reallusion, you can easily retouch your portraits into works of art.
