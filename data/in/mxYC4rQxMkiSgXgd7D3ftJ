You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Casablanca Colorado C42G45L takes a modern approach to the presentation of standard <a href=\"/best-ceiling-fans\">ceiling fans</a>. It is meant for a transitional or great room due to its 60-inch blade span, which makes it ideal for even the largest living space. While its airflow efficiency isn’t the best in its class, it still achieves an incredible level of airflow, combined with four speed settings and a wall control panel. Each of these contribute toward a fan that is not only stylist, but proves sufficient for large living quarters. ","Even top ceiling fans with a 60-inch span typically achieve airflow of 51 to 176 cubic feet per minute per watt, whereas this quiet ceiling fan achieves an efficiency rating of 74.2. Though this isn’t an incredible level of efficiency, the fan is still capable of delivering airflow at a rate of 6,944 cubic feet per minute. This circulation rate is achievable with both regular speed settings as well as when running in reverse, making it ideal for breaking up both hot and cool air pockets alike.","A wall control with cover plate is included with this best ceiling fan to conveniently hook up to a standard light switch. From the control panel, you can adjust the fan’s speed, dim the lights and reverse the direction the fan spins. There are four different speeds to choose from: 4 is high, 3 is medium, 2 is low and 1 is ultra-low. The lights can be dimmed by pressing the light button and holding until the desired dimness or brightness is achieved.","This quiet ceiling fan comes only with a 12-inch downrod, as this is what the fan is designed to work with. It comes with no flush mount kit, nor is one available for separate purchase, which means you should place this unit in an area with a ceiling high enough to accommodate its 30-inch vertical footprint.","The Casablanca Colorado ceiling fan is a fantastic addition for large rooms, as these most often need strong air circulation. This device comes with multiple speed settings, all controllable from a wall panel so that you don’t need a ladder to reach the pull string when you want to change speeds. The large blades, with their dark walnut finish, tie beautifully into the brushed chrome light fixture to give your room a very modern and sleek appearance."]},"id":"c1a4ed35-92aa-4f0f-a5f1-3b398f3659a8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56752","url":"/casablanca-colorado-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-14T01:56:41Z","datePublished":"2013-06-14T01:56:41Z","name":"Casablanca Colorado","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-06-14T01:56:41Z","id":"mxYC4rQxMkiSgXgd7D3ftJ","meta":{"title":"Casablanca Colorado Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Casablanca Colorado ceiling fan is specifically designed to work in great rooms.
