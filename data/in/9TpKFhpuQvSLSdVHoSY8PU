Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Aperture is photo-editing software for Mac that can help convert your photos from plain, ordinary snapshots into beautiful artwork. Aperture is also a powerful photo management and organization tool that can help you get your photo collection under control. While Aperture does not have the advanced creative tools available in our top-ranked <a href=\"/best-mac-photo-editing-software\">Mac  photo editing software</a>, it is by no means a weak or cheap image editor.","All the basic tools for adjusting the lighting in your digital photos are included in this image editor. You can use automatic settings to lighten an image, tweak the contrast and shadows as well as correct the white balance. Aperture can import 14 different file types, including JPEG, TIFF, PNG and GIF. It also supports the RAW image format, which is the ideal format for editing in Aperture.","Color control in Aperture is effective. You can use this Mac photo editing software to improve the overall coloring of the photo, or you can adjust the hue, saturation and tint of individual colors. You can make adjustments by using a slider to select the perfect setting.","Healing or editing your photos is very easy in Aperture, as this software has dedicated tools and brushes that let you fix skin blemishes, remove scratches and red eye, and allows you to eliminate unwanted objects from your image. Unfortunately, Aperture does not employ the use of layers, so be sure to save a copy of your original just in case. Fortunately, the brushes you use are non-destructive, and your actions can be undone to a certain point.","Aperture has an incredibly flexible photo-organizing feature that gives you full control over the metadata associated with your pictures. This means you can assign keywords, label photos by date and place, and rate and attach a color label for easier visual recognition. Another great feature that can streamline your importing and sorting process is Aperture&#39;s ability to recognize and sort photos by a person&#39;s face. You can assign a name to a photo, and this program lets you view photos sorted by the identified face.","Sharing from Aperture is simple, and you can publish your edited photos directly to Facebook and Flickr from within the program itself. Aperture is compatible with OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) and later and utilizes 64-Bit processing, so you can edit, import, open and save faster than ever before.","If you have any questions or problems with Aperture, you can contact Apple by email, or you can call their customer service phone line. User forums and a FAQs section are also available to search for answers. There are also many video and text tutorials available to teach you how to perform certain actions, such as importing a file or removing an object from your image. These are incredibly helpful for beginning photo editors as well as anyone trying to understand how Aperture works."]},"id":"016b6b74-5b61-4818-a813-0e5d089ddfab","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9c034d56-7d49-49c4-85b0-ddd634cc4cca","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Aperture is a great photo editor and organizer.
