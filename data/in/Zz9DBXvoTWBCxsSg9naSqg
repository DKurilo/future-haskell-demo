The better picture comes from built-in color filters, while the pixels on this TV actually turn off, giving you true blacks. In a dark room, the black colors are so dark they are imperceptible and images on the screen seem to float in the air.","Because of its size and OLED display, the EC9300 doesn’t need an ultra-high resolution to be visually impressive.
