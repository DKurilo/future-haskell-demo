It is round, measures 24 inches across and is transparent.","The Magni-Clear Solar Blanket is big enough for medium-sized swimming pools and most suited for pools with curves and angles. The material of this solar pool cover is a 1,200-gauge plastic polymer that allows the passage of solar rays. However, its surface has a special protective film that makes it resistant to rays. This protection is important to prolong the lifespan of the solar cover. However, you should not leave the Blue Wave Solar Blanket in the sun when not in use. Prolonged sun exposure can cause the separation of its layers. In addition, prolonged high and low temperatures shorten the lifespan of this pool cover. Therefore, you should remove the blanket on hot days and during winter and store it in a cool place.","The underside of the Blue Wave Magni-Clear Solar Blanket is covered with air bubbles. These bubbles create an insulating layer against cool winds. They prevent heat loss due to air convection and nighttime cooling. These heat-retaining thermal bubbles make a significant contribution to the ability of the solar blanket to raise the temperature of a swimming pool up to 15 degrees Fahrenheit. Yet another thing that may damage the bubbles and protective film on the surface of the blanket is concentrated chlorinated water. Be sure to avoid raising the chlorine concentration of your swimming pool above three parts per million when covering it with this blanket.","The color of the blanket is also important to its heating properties. By making the material of the solar blanket clear and transparent, Blue Wave ensures that the pool cover will not absorb or reflect incident sunlight. Therefore, a pool covered by the Blue Wave Solar Blanket receives most of the sunlight reaching it and is also warmed by the heat trapped by the blanket&#39;s air bubbles. With a thickness of 12 mils, or 0.012 inches, this pool blanket is thicker than most above-ground blankets available. This makes it durable, and Blue Wave backs it with a five-year warranty. If you are interested in a solar blanket with different colors, the <a href=\"/best-solar-pool-covers\">Doheny 5 Mil</a> has three color options.","With a clear layer of insulating air bubbles, the Blue Wave Magni-Clear Solar Blanket can significantly help lower the cost of heating your swimming pool. However, the pool blanket is too heavy to quickly deploy and remove, and it quickly deteriorates when left out on very hot days and during the winter."]},"id":"97096716-cfa5-4c8b-ad23-1a7695658ce2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63259","url":"/blue-wave-above-ground-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T19:50:42Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T19:50:42Z","name":"Blue Wave Above Ground Magni-Clear","synopsis":"This Magni-Clear Solar Blanket from Blue Wave is a solar cover for above-ground pools.
