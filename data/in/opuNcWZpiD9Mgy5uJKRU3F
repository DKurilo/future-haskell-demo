Designed for large rooms, it can move around a lot of air, 3,817 cubic feet per minute. In addition to its sheer power, the device is built with a contemporary appearance, and you can choose between a brushed bronze or brushed nickel finish. The fan has five reversible blades, so you can choose between cherry or black wood. With its frosted glass light dome, this device is not only aesthetically appealing but practical as both fan and light fixture.","This quiet ceiling fan generates exceptional airflow for a fan of its size. It has an airflow efficiency rating of 81 cubic feet per minute per watt on its highest speed. Because of this, the Hunter Palermo qualifies for an Energy Star certification for energy efficiency. As is typical of any ceiling fan with lights, when the lights are on, the airflow efficiency rating drops. Still, this does little to detract from the fact that this unit requires less than a tenth of the power a standard toaster needs to run.","You operate this ceiling fan using the included remote control. In addition to the remote, fan blades, motor and light cover, the box contains two 13-watt CFL light bulbs and a 3-inch downrod to improve airflow. Please note that the light bulbs in the box use pin-based connectors, so you won&#39;t be able to use standard bulbs. Also, some user reviews say the lights aren&#39;t very bright. You cannot flush mount this unit, as with the <a href=\"/comet-review\">Westinghouse Comet</a>, as the fan is designed to hang 14.11 inches from the ceiling. Because of its vertical height, you should plan on placing it in a room where it can hang at least 7 feet off the ground.","The best ceiling fans are quiet as they move air around the room. This fan is equipped with a WhisperWind motor, a proprietary motor that delivers incredible air movement while remaining silent. The motor itself is covered by a lifetime warranty and operates at an efficiency level that equates to an operational cost of $0.10 per kilowatt hour (kWH) while on the lowest speed setting. As such, it has very little impact on your electric bill. The motor is also reversible, so you can use the fan during the winter and summer months."]},"id":"787ce9d5-7a5e-40d8-92eb-53e308f325e4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67318","url":"/hunter-palermo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-27T21:58:32Z","datePublished":"2015-10-27T21:58:32Z","name":"Hunter Palermo","synopsis":"The Hunter Palermo is a 52-inch, low-profile ceiling fan.
