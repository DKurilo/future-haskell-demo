It is also one of only two monitors in our comparison to have a matte display. Our reviewers generally preferred a glassy surface over a matte one because of how it felt under their fingers; it’s generally more comfortable to use over extended periods of time. But a matte screen does reduce glare, a contributor to eyestrain, and limits the appearance of smudges and fingerprints. Some users prefer this less-reflective option.","This Lenovo model has the widest tilt range of all the touchscreen displays we reviewed, but we also found it the most difficult to adjust. The ThinkVision sits on a sturdy and solid A-frame stand, and we were concerned about damaging the monitor because of how much pressure we had to exert to get it to budge. After some practice, it got easier to adjust, but it couldn’t compete with the top-ranked models in our comparison, like the <a href=\"/acer-t232hl-review\">Acer T232HL</a> or the <a href=\"/planar-helium-review\">Planar Helium</a>, which were both sturdy and flexible, requiring a lighter touch. ","The Lenovo ThinkVision has one of the highest power consumptions in our review. Because of this, it’s more expensive to power over time than other monitors.","This model has a super thin bezel. While it ultimately comes down to personal preference, our testers found they preferred seamless bezels to ultra-thin ones because they made for a more satisfying touch experience. When you choose a monitor with seamless bezels, you don’t bump the edges of the display when you adjust or use the touchscreen surface.","The on-screen display (OSD) controls are located on the bottom bezel in the right-hand corner and have raised buttons. Because you adjust the angle of a touchscreen more frequently than you do that of a standard monitor, displays with clean edges, uncluttered by OSD controls, improve the user experience. While it’s usually easy to lock these buttons to keep the display control menu from popping up and disrupting workflow, more thoughtful designs house the buttons in an out-of-the-way location.","Because we look at so many photos and videos online, it’s important for a display to represent colors as accurately as possible, even for casual users. We evaluated the Lenovo’s color accuracy using calMAN software, which compares the output of the display to a standardized chart of red, green and blue. During testing, we also measured the display’s ability to create a bright white and true black, which have huge impact on color quality. At its default display settings, the ThinkVision scored closer to these standards than the other touchscreens we reviewed.","There are other features that affect the quality of the display, including response time, which measures how quickly individual pixels change color; the gamma score, which measures how well the display creates dimension in videos and photos; and pixel pitch, which is a measurement that indicates the display’s sharpness and clarity. These were all average on the Lenovo ThinkVision.","It is one of the most connectable monitors in our comparison. It has both a DisplayPort and HDMI connection as well as a headphone jack and USB 3.0 ports. While the downstream USB 3.0 connections are easy to access from the side of the monitor, the rest of the ports are concealed and difficult to get to unless you remove the stand from the monitor completely.","This monitor doesn’t have an onboard speaker system. While monitor speakers don’t usually have good sound quality, their absence is a bit of a downside. ","Lenovo has email, phone and live chat support channels, but the company requires information about your product before you can contact technical support. The display also comes with a standard three-year warranty."]},"id":"c701da18-0843-4588-8a3d-cdc3e6cdd283","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"086845ff-5d75-4ff3-a131-aa98078ab0c3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Lenovo ThinkVision T2364t didn’t make it in our top three picks, mostly because it is so hard to adjust.
