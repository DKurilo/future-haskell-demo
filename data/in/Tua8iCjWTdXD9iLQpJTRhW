The Breville Ikon’s four-slot capacity (1.5 inches wide by 6 inches deep) allows for all types bread – and lots of it. All cooking functions are controlled on the left hand side of the toaster and are very easy to operate. An LED light illuminates the function you’ve chosen, and when the cycle is complete the toaster shuts itself off. Located directly below the control buttons are the digital shade selector and countdown timer. The timer counts down the cycle and beeps when the toast cycle is complete. This toaster doesn’t have an attachment for cooking eggs, but in addition to bread, it can toast bagels, English muffins, waffles and croissants."]},"id":"cb0d4174-f357-4a5a-8b12-980658b45f3a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"6fbbc727-04d3-47ce-a1d8-57eebeecff06","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can easily modify all settings from the control area of the Ikon toaster. Use the shade selector to control the degree of toasting from 1-10. The user manual suggests starting at shade four and working your way up or down to find the setting that makes your perfect piece of toast. A convenient digital display shows which level you’re currently on and includes a timer that counts down to completion.","We love Breville’s specific setting for bagels. This setting alters the toaster’s heating coils so that one side is hotter than the other. By doing this, the bagel is perfectly toasted on the cut side and warmed on the outside. For this to happen, you must insert your bagel with the cut side facing towards the middle coils and select the bagel setting.","If your bagel or bread is frozen, activate the defrost setting and the toaster will add extra time to your preferred cycle. This setting can also be used for frozen waffles, pancakes or other frozen breakfast breads. If you&#39;re defrosting a bagel, be sure to select both the bagel and the defrost settings. You can also reheat previously toasted bread with the reheat setting. It will not toast the bread again but will keep it warm.","Despite having four slots, the setup of this toaster’s controls doesn’t allow individualized settings for each slot. Once you have set the shade selector and cooking options, those settings are applied to all of the slots. We see this as a shortfall if you need to cook more than one type of bread at a time.","For those who are in a rush or simply don’t trust toaster timers, this pop up toaster’s lift and look lever is perfect. Simply slide the lever up to check on the toast without cancelling the cycle. This convenient way to peek is a fantastic time saver, especially on busy mornings. To cancel the cycle at any time, simply select the cancel button and the unit will stop mid-cycle. On the other side of the lift and look lever is the high-lift lever. This lever makes even the tiniest English muffin rise to the top of the toaster for easy removal."]},"id":"3b9b0600-3c0f-4620-bcd4-3570cd009c77","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"904a07c4-4e5f-4150-8a93-430854a74b57","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["To ensure a long life for your toaster, proper cleaning it is key. Look for the Breville’s slide-out crumb tray at the bottom rear of the toaster.  This tray is easy to clean up, and when you keep your toaster free of crumbs, your toaster will last longer. Also located on the bottom of the toaster is the hide away cord. Wrap the cord up when not in use and you’ll never have to worry about tripping over it.","The progress indicator is a handy feature that indicates when a toast cycle is complete. It also shuts down the toaster automatically to save on energy consumption. In case the unit shuts down before you’re through using it, Breville has a setting remembrance component that remembers the last used setting. When you manually shut off the toaster, it also defaults to your preferred setting. Another convenient feature is the toaster’s self-centering slots. This element ensures your bread is evenly toasted."]},"id":"759c3f86-7ddb-4352-a198-5e5931a34461","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Safety"},"id":"8c92fc0c-0968-4015-bde6-8d87703c5e57","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Breville guarantees this toaster is free from “defects due to faulty material or workmanship” for one year from the purchase date.
