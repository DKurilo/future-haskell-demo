Only a select few Bluetooth headsets have NFC.","We tested the quality of the device’s speaker by having a caller recite portions from John F. Kennedy&#39;s inaugural address while the reviewer wearing the headset transcribed what they heard. Next, we compared the reviewer’s transcription to the actual speech and checked for errors. This headset received a perfect score.","To analyze the Edge&#39;s audio quality and voice isolation, a tester made a phone call while walking to work in the morning.

Our office is next to a school, and several kids were outside screaming and playing, but the person on the other end of the line didn’t complain about the noise.","We also tested the microphone by calling and leaving messages on a Google Voice number from different locations, including outside on a windy day, in our office and in a car.
