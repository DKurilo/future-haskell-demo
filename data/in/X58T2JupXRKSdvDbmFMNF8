Although you may mourn the discontinuation of Final Cut Express, you&#39;re probably not weeping over Windows Movie Maker. Great <a href=\"/best-video-editing-software\">video editing software</a> usually comes with a steep price. That price tag typically includes professional tools and features you simply cannot find in free versions. How true is that, though?","Free video editing software may not have decades of development behind it, but the groundwork was laid by others, and now there are so many titles out there, it can be hard to pick one. Several free programs, whether you download them or use web-based apps, are worth your time.","First, you need to decide why you need video editing software. Are you splicing together shots of you trying to perform a kickflip and uploading it on YouTube? You&#39;re likely not going to need the full-featured software that&#39;s out there. Are you producing a music video, or a new food television show for your website? You&#39;ll need something more robust that&#39;s capable of handling several cuts, music, fades, special effects, and more.","<strong>iMovie</strong>","This entry almost goes without saying. If you&#39;re a Mac user, you&#39;re probably already familiar with iMovie – even if you don&#39;t use Macs, you&#39;ve at least heard of this famous software. Although professional editors turn their nose up at iMovie, it&#39;s an excellent free option for amateur filmmakers.","Although you won&#39;t find many feature films edited entirely in iMovie (a documentary titled Tarnation that premiered in 2004 at Sundance is an exception), you will find plenty of videos on YouTube, Vimeo and other websites.","The reason this is one of the best video editing options for Macs is that it&#39;s 100 percent free and comes bundled with your Mac. It&#39;s also easy to use with its intuitive interface and keyboard shortcuts. The obvious features are there, of course, like importing and exporting video, a timeline that shows you the video you want to edit, and the ability to move bits of your film here and there.","<strong>What&#39;s in the Toolbox?</strong>"]},"id":"40b5e2c7-aa0c-41e2-8679-3ed8b9a3292a","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Enhance:</strong> Automatically enhance your video with a click of this magic wand that changes your video and audio slightly to make it a bit better (color correction, balance, etc.); you can make manual changes by heading over to Adjust.","<strong>Adjust: </strong>This is where you&#39;ll find familiar editing features such as volume, noise reduction, equalizer, color correction, color balance, cropping, stabilization, video effects and sound effects.","<strong>Slow Motion: </strong>You can find this option right in the timeline for easy access.","<strong>Auto Upload to iCloud: </strong>This feature makes it quick and easy to get your clips hosted online, but you&#39;re limited to 15-minute videos.","<strong>Multilayer Editing: </strong>Drag and drop a clip on top of another to quickly create a straightaway cut to the next clip, green or blue screen, split screen or create picture-in-picture edits.","<strong>Speed Control: </strong>Slow clips down by 50 percent, or speed them up to 20 times their original speed; you can also create instant replays.","<strong>Sharing: </strong>You can share directly via Facebook, YouTube, email, iMovie Theater or other options."],"type":"ul"},"id":"262e4aee-4b8a-460d-a628-912822ec5421","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Lightworks</strong>","Whether you&#39;ve heard of Lightworks or not shouldn&#39;t concern you.

However, there&#39;s a free version meant for home users that&#39;s, yes, limited, but still has powerful features.","Originally, Lightworks was only available for Windows users, but it&#39;s been made available for Mac and Linux users, too. The biggest downside of the free version of Lightworks is debatable. Some editors claim it&#39;s the lack of audio editing tools, while others complain about the lack of support.

The biggest benefit of using this free software is that there is no paid version, so you aren&#39;t losing out on features you could have if you paid for a heftier version.

Although video editing isn&#39;t its focus, it doesn&#39;t seem to lack the features that others have. You can use Blender on a PC that&#39;s running Windows or Linux, or you can use it on a Mac.

More pro editors than ever use this suite of software. It comes at a hefty price, though. An individual license (with a $299 upgrade plan every year) is $1,299.","<strong>Final Cut Pro: </strong>The film &#34;Focus,&#34; starring Will Smith, was edited on Apple&#39;s film editing software.

The big benefit to using this software is that you can integrate other Adobe software, such as After Effects, Photoshop, Story and Prelude.
