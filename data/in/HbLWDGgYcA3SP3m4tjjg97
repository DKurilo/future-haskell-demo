The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-garage-door-openers\">Garage Door Openers here</a>.<br/></em>","The Genie BeltLift lacks some of the extras that other garage door openers have, but it is built to get the basic job done. Also, like all of its belt-driven comrades, this garage door opener has a reputation for quiet operation. This garage door opener might be a good option for someone with a bedroom above their garage. It might not be the best option for anyone who has grown accustomed to extras like motion-detecting light systems or keyless entry pads, though some shoppers do not consider those extras in terms of security. Keyless entry gives you a way to control your door even if you are concerned one of your remotes may have fallen into the hands of a thief, and a motion-detecting light can make sure you are never alone in a dark garage.","This garage door opener also has a very basic wall console. It actually can’t be called a console at all. It is a button. That means there is no way to control anything beyond the door from the wall – no light switch or locking button.This opener is designed to handle an average, sectional, 7-foot residential garage door and nothing more. A stronger opener will work better for heavier doors.","This garage door opener has some great features too, though. It is compatible with both HomeLink and Car2U home automation systems. These make coming home much more pleasant by allowing you to control your garage door opener and lights in your home from a button in your car.","Also, the safety features are quite good, as was the case with all Genie garage door openers we looked at. The infrared beam system is there and so is the automatic reversal in case it comes into contact with anything at any point during the closing process. This garage door opener takes safety even a step further by automatically opening if the door fails to close within 30 seconds, even if there is no obvious obstruction. A garage door opener system like this that errs on the side of safety will be great for households with children or pets. If all other safety features fail this garage door opener has a manual emergency release for use in a power outage or an emergency.","Even though there is no motion detection the light does automatically come on whenever the door is in use. It turns itself off after three minutes. The light is a little dim compared to some of the garage door openers we looked at – 75 watts – but if you have a smaller garage it will work just fine.","Among this garage door opener’s security features is a rolling code system. This helps protect you by issuing a different code each time you use your remote so no unauthorized person can pirate the number and open your door.","The warranty is not overly impressive – just one year on parts and five years on the motor. We prefer more. Genie customer support is generally good. We were able to find the online version of this garage door opener’s manual and answers to most of our questions on their website. Support over the phone was good as well."]},"id":"d8d298e7-7b0c-4571-aa7e-de576d26fee2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cd3fab1d-6a00-412f-8f24-15ded5ec41f3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Genie belt garage door opener is fairly basic, but not everyone is worried about having multiple remote controls right out of the box or advanced wall consoles. <strong> </strong>Genie BeltLift is simply designed to open and close your garage door and do it quietly."]},"id":"a303fdd5-8feb-4bbf-9528-d07774095bcc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52892","url":"/genie-beltlift-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-05-24T14:07:23Z","datePublished":"2011-05-24T14:07:23Z","name":"Genie BeltLift","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
