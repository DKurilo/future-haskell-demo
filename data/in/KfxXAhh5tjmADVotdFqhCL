You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Samsung is constantly innovating and moving technology forward in consumer electronics and home appliances. The Samsung RF series of refrigerators is a progressive line of home appliances, and the RF4289HARS is actually a Wi-Fi-enabled <a href=\"/best-french-door-refrigerators\">french door refrigerator</a>. It has a touchscreen control panel that has apps and access to the internet through your home Wi-Fi connection. Besides being a smart fridge, this is also a very large fridge; the total capacity is 28 cubic feet with the refrigerated section having 16.3 cubic feet of capacity. The external drawer has a capacity of 4 cubic feet and the freezer drawer has 7.7 cubic feet of capacity.","The control panel on the external ice and water dispenser sits on the left side door of this french door refrigerator. The control panel is a color LCD touchscreen, much like a tablet on your fridge door. Once you are connected to your Wi-Fi, you have access to apps like Epicurious, Pandora and Twitter. Note that you can only read tweets from your fridge – you can&#39;t send any. Also, you can listen to Pandora through the two built-in speakers tucked away under the panel next to the spigot for the dispenser. You can control the temperature of the fresh food and freezer compartments from this control panel, as well as check the weather, read the news, sync with your Google calendar and write notes.","The interior of the refrigerated compartment has a very sleek, modern look with stainless steel trim on the door bins and shelves. This Samsung refrigerator comes with five spill-proof shelves that are also adjustable and adaptable. Not only can you move the shelves up and down in the compartment – some of the shelves also slide back to make room for tall items, and the quarter-width shelf folds up to lean against the side of the icemaker.","The refrigerated compartment also has two crisper bins, and you can adjust the humidity levels in them. You can also adjust the temperature in the full-width external drawer. The customizable drawer dividers help make this space organized and useful. The doors to the refrigerated compartment have six bins between the two doors. Four of these bins can hold a gallon-sized container such as a jug of milk or juice; however, two of the bins look like they can barely hold one jug of milk.","The freezer has two tiers with four total plastic bins inside. The front panel of the top tier is clear so that you can see inside without pulling out the drawer. The upper tier drawer is just one wide compartment without any dividers so your items can slide around. The bottom tier has a divider, but it is disappointing after seeing the organization options you have in the fresh food compartment. The last bin is on the door of the freezer drawer and is designed to hold small items."]},"id":"d7cfbfcc-f8ea-4abf-ae68-18873e5052c7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"885b1653-acaf-457a-a80c-322f6da68db7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As a four-door french door refrigerator, this model is spacious at 28 cubic feet.
