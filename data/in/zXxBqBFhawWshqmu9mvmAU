This brand&#39;s classic slings are easy to wear, comfortable for babies, and among the most popular and well-known designs on the market. While some parents may balk at the apparent lack of security in this design, those fears are largely unfounded when the sling is worn correctly.","Most Maya Wraps are one long, wide strip of material with two metal rings at one end. You wrap the material around your body, then loop it through the rings and double back on the loop. Other wraps are long pieces of fabric that you must tie around your body. It&#39;s understandable why some parents feel dubious about the security of this format, as it doesn&#39;t use knots or buckles, but the friction created by doubling back through the ring provides more than enough security. If you&#39;d rather not deal with buckles, consider using the <a href=\"/best-baby-wraps\">Baby K&#39;Tan BREEZE</a>.","This baby sling comes in sizes small through extra-large, based on the length of the material. The sling sizing guide is based on the height of the adult, though you may want to think about going up a size from your original purchase as your child approaches the toddler years. Maya baby carriers accommodate infants as small as eight pounds to toddlers as large as 35 pounds, with different recommended carrying positions based on the child&#39;s age.","The Maya Wrap Baby Sling is machine washable for convenience. In addition, you can use the tail end of the sling as a nursing cover-up when it&#39;s sized properly. The sling comes in various solid colors and patterns, most of which are fairly gender-neutral.","The Maya Wrap website provides ample information regarding safety and instructions on how to correctly use each sling. The company also suggests that before you use these slings with your children, you practice with a doll to ensure you have learned how to tie the product correctly.","If you need to return your sling for any reason, the company accepts returns or exchanges 30 days from the original purchase date. However, the baby sling must be brand-new and unused."]},"id":"b41cd4e3-567f-46ec-bcc3-4e72a42d6d3e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58773","url":"/maya-wrap-baby-sling-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-03T23:51:46Z","datePublished":"2014-02-03T23:51:46Z","name":"Maya Wrap Baby Sling","synopsis":"When someone says \"baby sling,\" the first image that pops into your head is probably the Maya Wrap.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"When someone says \"baby sling,\" the first image that pops into your head is probably the Maya Wrap.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-02-03T23:51:46Z","id":"zXxBqBFhawWshqmu9mvmAU","meta":{"title":"Maya Wrap Baby Sling Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Maya Wrap provides traditional baby wraps.
