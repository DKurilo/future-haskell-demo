Its professional quality flat irons secured a place in the styling winner&#39;s circle, but its <a href=\"/best-curling-irons\">curling iron</a> line gets plenty of attention, too. Available in 1- and 1.5-inch barrel sizes and weighing in at a solid 1.3 pounds, the CHI Air is a popular curling iron and a stylist’s pick for many reasons. The smooth glide tourmaline-ceramic barrel produces evenly distributed far-infrared heat. This technology reduces static in your hair by using radiant heat to improve it, rather than burn it. Styling tools with a blend of tourmaline and ceramic are the best curling irons for naturally frizzy hair in need of some discipline without snagging or catching hair in the clamp.","A large digital temperature interface helps you pinpoint the exact temperature that works best with your hair and lock the magic number into the curling iron&#39;s display. The barrel reaches up to 400-degrees Fahrenheit, so even stubbornly straight hair yields to the CHI Air.","With an anti-slip handle, this curling iron helps you get a grip on hard-to-style places like the back of your head or behind your ears. The 9 -foot long swivel cord gives you the extra stretch to reach the mirror and includes a Velcro strap for easy storage and portability. Since it comes in five different color options, you&#39;ll find a look that fits your style."]},"id":"41ba1ea9-030d-4be0-8faf-716a895c0054","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/qo5DoAeTPkFVkuTyFea88D.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"If you have ever accidently burned your ears or fingers on a curling iron, you know that with great style comes great responsibility. Thankfully, the minds behind this CHI model thought ahead and included ingenious safety features. The extra-long cool tip allows you to turn the barrel with more control without worrying about burning your fingers, and the rubber coated barrel stand adds stability and safety when the iron isn&#39;t locking curls into your hair. There’s also an auto shut-off for the Forgetful Felicities out there. This feature cuts off power to the curling iron automatically after 60 minutes, a helpful feature that mean you won&#39;t burn your house down if you forget to turn the curling iron off. That is, if you didn&#39;t leave the oven on too. Ironically, you have to remember to turn on this feature for it to work properly. The warranty guarantees repair or replacement within two years of purchase.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57445-chi-air-ceramic3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qo5DoAeTPkFVkuTyFea88D.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"qo5DoAeTPkFVkuTyFea88D","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qo5DoAeTPkFVkuTyFea88D.jpg","alt":""},"id":"7de012d2-3af9-45f5-b373-b1962faffddb","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The CHI Air is a formidable force in the styling world.
