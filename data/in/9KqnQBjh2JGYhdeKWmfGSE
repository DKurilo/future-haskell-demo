It&#39;s also reliable, using tested features such as a line feed that activates when you bump the tool on the ground, comfortable trigger controls and an assortment of landscaping attachments. Despite the machine&#39;s raw power, the Husqvarna trimmer is also lighter than most gas weed whackers. In fact, its power in proportion to its weight is the most impressive in our lineup.","The straight-shaft Husqvarna is ideal for small to medium-sized yards, but you can also use this grass trimmer on larger properties as well. Its adjustable handle makes it easy to use no matter how tall you are. Husqvarna also offers decent technical support for its products."]},"id":"7e06b4d8-6b7c-4819-96b0-19d2cdbdc417","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"d15c4703-bbab-4fd6-a373-cb52438fb5a0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/oupSdLTZ5ZqBayxN4F3TJb.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/52760-husqvarna-128djx20.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oupSdLTZ5ZqBayxN4F3TJb.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"oupSdLTZ5ZqBayxN4F3TJb","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oupSdLTZ5ZqBayxN4F3TJb.jpg","alt":""},"id":"8f2207f8-7d0a-443d-90d0-293e79a32f75","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Yard work goes much faster when you use a weed whacker with a wide cutting swath. The Husqvarna trimmer checks in at an impressive 17 inches, meaning you only have to go over the long grass and weeds around the edges of your lawn once. Its 1.1-horsepower, 28 cc engine makes it the most powerful two-cycle weed whacker in our review.","The engineers at Husqvarna decided to go with a two-cycle engine for the 128DJx trimmer, which allows its lightweight form. However, that means you must use a mixture of gas and oil in the 13.6-ounce fuel tank. The engine is also slightly noisier than its four-cycle competitors are, but a two-cycle engine is easier to repair if the need ever arises.","This gas trimmer has the full complement of the features we looked for in the best weed whackers. It starts with a head that releases trimming line in two places, making your job twice as easy. You release that nylon line by simply tapping the head on the ground, which has become second nature to landscaping professionals everywhere.","This weed whacker also features comfortable trigger controls and a wide debris shield to keep bits of weed and grass from flinging onto your face and clothes. Even with the generous shield, we recommend wearing safety glasses and steel-toed boots any time you whack weeds with a machine this powerful. You can adjust the handle height on the trimmer to create the perfect balance for your size and strength. The gas weed whacker&#39;s straight shaft is great for getting at tall grass and weeds under porches. You can extend the spinning head several inches farther with this model than you can with its curved-shaft counterparts.","If there are people who prefer weed whipping to playing on the beach or sipping ice-cold lemonade, we don&#39;t know where to find them. For the rest of us, squeezing yard work into the shortest possible time is important. This yard trimmer has both positive and negative attributes when you measure it with time in mind. You need to mix gas and oil in the fuel tank rather than just pouring the fuel and lubricant straight from a bottle. However, the weed whacker&#39;s efficient engine and pull starter are designed for speed.","Husqvarna&#39;s model is also efficient when it comes to replacing a spool. You can do the job without tools. You can also use the machine for long periods because of its anti-vibration design."]},"id":"198a6165-b62f-4807-ab9d-3273298b8901","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"a40c5e3c-9b49-4639-b993-a42ac22b56d2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/9PecBRV6eVrmkAkoATtku9.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/52760-husqvarna-128djx11.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9PecBRV6eVrmkAkoATtku9.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"9PecBRV6eVrmkAkoATtku9","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9PecBRV6eVrmkAkoATtku9.jpg","alt":""},"id":"1d95ebb8-b956-4d42-a60e-ca375be0374c","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The extras available with the Husqvarna trimmer line place this model securely among our top weed whackers.
