You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Jandy JXi 200 is a gas heater that can run on either natural gas or propane. It was designed to be easy to install and use; for example, its top can rotate 180 degrees to make it easy to access the control panel. Its compact, lightweight body can fit into any pool arrangement, making it a great replacement or retrofit option.","The JXi 200 has an output of 200,000 Btu (British thermal unit) per hour. There are two other options in the JXi line of <a href=\"/best-pool-heaters\">pool heaters</a>, with 260,000 and 399,000 Btu outputs for larger pools. Since there aren’t models with outputs less than 200,000 Btu, JXi heaters aren’t a good option for small pools. The 200,000 Btu model has an 83-percent efficiency rating, which exceeds any Department of Energy regulations. It also has low NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions, which meets air quality regulations in the U.S.","This Jandy heater uses a copper fin heat exchanger for efficient heat transfer. Copper tends to be more efficient but less resistant to corrosion than cupro nickel, an alloy of copper and nickel that other products – such as the <a href=\"/hayward-review\">Hayward Universal H200</a> – use. The JXi 200 can also be used with Jandy&#39;s VersaFlow Integrated Bypass technology, which increases energy savings up to 20 percent over systems without it. This introduces a flow bypass valve into the JXi heater&#39;s header, and it works automatically depending on the call for heat without human interaction.","The JXi heater&#39;s control panel features a digital display, temperature set arrow buttons, pool and spa buttons, and a menu button. You can use the control panel to set your pool&#39;s temperature, set both the pool and spa settings, configure your display and interaction settings, and lock your current settings to prevent any accidental temperature changes. The display also communicates issues with the heater&#39;s operation with error messages.","Zodiac (Jandy&#39;s parent company) offers a one-year warranty on its pool heaters, which is standard among the products we reviewed. We recommend hiring a professional to install your unit, as improper installation and resulting damage are not covered and can void your warranty. Should you need to contact customer support, you can use phone, email, live chat or the contact form on the manufacturer&#39;s support page. There are also resources, such as product manuals and warranty information, available on Jandy&#39;s website.","The Jandy JXi is a good little heater that is a great choice if you need something compact and flexible. To save yourself a little money and run your heater less frequently, we recommend using your heater in conjunction with a solar pool cover to insulate your pool and prevent evaporation."]},"id":"76719960-edd6-41eb-a25f-776761e7c9e5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66207","url":"/jandy-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-14T21:21:14Z","datePublished":"2015-07-14T21:21:14Z","name":"Jandy JXi 200N or 200P","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":80,"verdict":"The Jandy JXi 200 is a great little gas heater with user-friendly controls.","pros":["Its compact, lightweight design makes it a great retrofit option."],"cons":["It isn&#039;t suitable for small pools."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-03-16T00:00:00Z","id":"MnLLB3guL88s3qM2SfYJaA","meta":{"title":"Jandy Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Jandy JXi 200 is a great little gas heater with user-friendly controls."},"products":[{"slug":"jandy-jxi-200n-or-200p","url":"/product/jandy-jxi-200n-or-200p","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:26:31Z","name":"Jandy JXi 200N or 200P","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:26:31Z","id":"kf5wzBbp3mrewRDTPuSRrG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:26:31Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/7o6kNf9FJf5KZGPr6u5ag.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:26:31Z","mimeType":"","name":"28f917c6d92e1d541d17a0195bf71300.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/28f917c6d92e1d541d17a0195bf71300.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:26:31Z","id":"7o6kNf9FJf5KZGPr6u5ag","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7o6kNf9FJf5KZGPr6u5ag.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Jandy Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Jandy JXi 200 is a great little gas heater with user-friendly controls."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/7o6kNf9FJf5KZGPr6u5ag.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:26:31Z","mimeType":"","name":"28f917c6d92e1d541d17a0195bf71300.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/28f917c6d92e1d541d17a0195bf71300.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:26:31Z","id":"7o6kNf9FJf5KZGPr6u5ag","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7o6kNf9FJf5KZGPr6u5ag.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Jandy Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Jandy JXi 200 is a great little gas heater with user-friendly controls."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/outdoor/best-pool-heaters/jandy-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:26:31Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:26:31Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"pool-and-hot-tub","url":"/home-and-garden/pool-and-hot-tub","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:26:31Z","name":"Pool & Hot Tub","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:26:31Z","id":"Snsyvysc6JMsPB5BLBFHBh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
