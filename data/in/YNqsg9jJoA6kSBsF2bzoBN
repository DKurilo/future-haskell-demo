Yet we want our French fries, or chips, fried chicken and doughnuts, so we buy them anyway, at fast food restaurants, or we invest in <a href=\"/best-deep-fryers\">deep fryers</a> for our homes. Recently, many kitchen appliance manufacturers introduced the airfryer   a device that uses extremely hot air that circulates around food in order to &#34;fry&#34; it.","Science and technology play huge roles in cooking and baking. We know that the Maillard reaction, when food is heated above 285 degrees Fahrenheit, creates flavorful, browned food. Whether heated by direct or indirect heat, food s flavor compounds, and its appearance changes. Airfryers are able to do this, but without the added fat from frying, do French fries still taste as good as their deep fried counterparts? Do they get as crispy?","We tested three models alongside several deep fryers. And we wanted to put the airfryers to the same tests so we could compare deep fried foods to air fried foods. We set up the Philips Viva Collection Airfryer, the DeLonghi Multifry, and the Avalon Bay Airfryer next to one another and &#34;fried&#34; raw potatoes for French fries and breaded chicken strips. We assembled a jury of taste testers to judge the crispiness, flavor and moisture of our French fries and chicken strips.","<strong>French Fries </strong><br/>For each airfryer, we used one medium potato, unpeeled, cut into one-half inch thick strips and coated in about a tablespoon of oil, as suggested by most airfryer manufacturers. Time and temperature varies with each airfryer and whether you re cooking frozen or fresh fries. You also have to keep an eye on the airfryer and shake the basket of fries about halfway through cooking to ensure the air reaches every potato strip and cooks evenly.","Once the timer beeped for each airfryer, we taste tested every batch, and every tester had similar opinions: The Avalon Bay and Philips airfryers made the best-tasting and crispiest French fries, but it&#39;s relative. We found that fresh potatoes don&#39;t easily become flavorful and satisfying from airfrying.","Fries were not golden brown and crackling when they came out of the fryer   they were browned in spots, but mostly the light yellow potato color they were when we put them in. They were not tender and fluffy inside, rather, they were lacking moisture and the seasoning didn t easily stick to the fries.","<strong>Fried Chicken Strips</strong><br/>Frozen breaded chicken strips went into the airfryer without defrosting and came out hot, crispy and pretty tasty. The chicken strips already had oil in the breading, so we didn t need to add additional oil to cook them. Each airfryer produced good results, and our testers had the highest marks for the DeLonghi Multifry. The chicken was moist on the inside and flavorful throughout. Compared to the deep fried batches, though, these still fell flat.","<strong>Overall Verdict and Recommendations<br/></strong>After testing batches of fries and chicken in the airfryers, we came to the conclusion that an airfryer is sort of a hybrid between a convection oven and a dehydrator. The heated air circulates around food and cooks it as evenly as possible. The baskets that hold the food have holes and slats that allow the air to circulate around the exposed surface of the food.","You can replicate airfying in your own oven if you have a convection setting   just place your fries or chicken on a rack and then bake. The dehydration was most noticeable in the potatoes   the flavor seemed to have been leached and not much flavor was added.","We did like how quickly this small appliance heated up   it took only minutes to preheat   and it cooked food more quickly than a conventional oven. As a healthy alternative, air fried food could fit your needs. And any one of the three airfryers we tested would work well. Experiment with seasonings, oil amounts and cooking time   you may find a combination that satisfies what you want out of your favorite snacks."]},"id":"fcd844f2-7b0a-426d-bdc4-b52a6647851d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9885","url":"/the-truth-about-airfryers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"amy-smith","url":"/author/amy-smith","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Amy Smith","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"VvRVzZS66inXAvufMA5SvT","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-11-19T17:37:15Z","datePublished":"2015-11-19T17:37:15Z","name":"The Truth About Airfryers","synopsis":"Fried food is undeniably delicious, but frying is also regarded as one of the least healthy methods of cooking.","review":{},"strapline":"Fried food is undeniably delicious, but frying is also regarded as one of the least healthy methods of cooking.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-11-19T17:43:07Z","id":"YNqsg9jJoA6kSBsF2bzoBN","meta":{"title":"The Truth About Airfryers","description":"Crispy, delicious fried food with up to 80 percent less fat &ndash; is it all just a bunch of hot air?
