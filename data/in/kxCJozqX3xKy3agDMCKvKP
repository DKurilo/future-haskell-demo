It dwarfs the other microscopes we reviewed in terms of size. Its heavier weight, lack of a carrying case and the fact that it has to be plugged into a wall makes it less portable than others we reviewed, but the gorgeous views make up for these drawbacks.","This microscope for students features a monocular design that will help you see cellular structures on slides. The three objective  lenses – a 4x, 10x and 40x – offer 40x, 100x and 400x magnification levels. The controls operate smoothly and allow you to get just the image you want. You can also adjust the 0.65 Numerical Aperture (N.A.) condenser lens under the stage to further help you fine tune the lighting under each slide.","This microscope does not come with many accessories, but you can purchase packages of additional equipment. The basic package includes a beautifully illustrated manual, &#34;The World of the Microscope,&#34; as well as five prepared slides of human blood, cerebellum, liver, spinal cord and heart tissues. Looking at interesting things under the microscope is part of what draws children into using microscopes, and this one offers a solid starting base.","Your child may have limited options with this scope simply because you can&#39;t view solid objects lit from above, as there is no above-stage lighting to be found on this scope. The ability to pick up something random from any environment and put it under the microscope is fun for children. Unfortunately, the Omano OM118-M3 does not allow for that. You will have impressive  views of all of the included slides and any others you prepare of translucent objects, though. The microscope tested especially well when we viewed smaller objects.","This scope does not include a carrying case for portability, but it does have a dust cover. The dust cover offers protection in storage and teaches children about the proper care of scientific equipment.","Omano is a Microscope.com brand, so the customer support  will come from Microscope.com staff. They respond to customer questions through email, telephone and live chat, all of which are available during business hours."]},"id":"aed9e29f-396a-463f-b062-0323a7077c3b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b8b112bb-25e7-4477-9434-eb2ee84d64a4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is one of the best microscopes for kids that have a serious interest in science, or for middle and high school-aged students.
