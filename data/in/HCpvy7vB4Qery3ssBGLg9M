We compared specifications, combed through user reviews, consulted professional literature and more to make sure we picked the right models for the right purposes. We also spoke with each company’s support staff to assess whether you can get the assistance you need when you need it. We periodically re-evaluate the riding lawn mowers we feature to make sure they’re the best and most current models available.","<strong>How We Picked the Best</strong>","As we evaluated each mower, we accounted for things like speed, cutting width, overall design, engine power and transmission type. Since these are very expensive machines, we also considered price so we could find the models that give you the most value for your dollar.","Our top choice earned its spot by striking a favorable balance among all these criteria. While we believe it is the best mower for most people, it isn’t necessarily the best fit for everyone. For example, if you own a lawn care business, you need a machine that is built to handle more than the weekly mow.","Every model we feature was subject to scrutiny based on its specifications, feature set, and feedback from real-life users. Our final choices represent the best each brand offers.","We also reached out to professionals who use riding lawnmowers on a daily basis. We spoke to Steve Hough of Hough Landscaping, who has used a dozen different types of riding lawn mowers for more than two decades, about what he looks for when he buys a mower for his business.","When he selects a new riding mower for his service he considers productivity, price, and how many hours he will get out of a mower during its lifetime. Other considerations include serviceability, reliability and down time. For professional situations he prefers <a href=\"/exmark-review\">eXmark machines</a> because they’re lower priced and functional; you won’t pay extra for the green paint on brands like John Deere.","However, for his personal use he does prefer John Deere because &#34;It&#39;s been a trusted name across multiple generations; always reliable, high-quality service from the dealer, and eliminates a lot of headaches.&#34;","We&#39;ve identified criteria that can help you select the best riding mower for your projects. Speed, cutting width, zero-turn design, engine placement and transmission are key factors when determining which one is right for you.<br/><br/>How Much Do Riding Lawnmowers Cost?<br/>These machines can be quite expensive. But there’s a model for nearly all budgets. Among the lawnmowers we reviewed, the cheapest was about $750, while the most expensive is over $10,000. So, it runs the gamut, and if you really want one, there’s one out there that fits your needs and budget.","Speed<br/>The faster the ride-on mower drives, the sooner you complete your job. High speed is most important if you are a professional maintenance worker or landscaper because it gets you on to your next project quickly, increasing profits.","Cutting Width<br/>A wider blade cuts a larger area with each pass, getting the job done faster. However, some lawn mowers might be too wide to maneuver comfortably through your property. Make certain there aren’t any spots on the lawn that are too tight to fit the mower you select.","Zero-Turn Design<br/>Zero-turn lawn mowers have the tightest turning radius, which translates to excellent maneuverability and makes it easy to get around trees, shrubs and lawn statues. However, they do have some difficulty maneuvering on hills because they tend to turn too sharply on steep terrain.","Engine Placement<br/>In general, the mower’s engine placement determines its power. Rear-engine models are smaller and have less power, and zero-turn mowers normally have rear engines. Front-engine tractor models have larger engines and more power and cutting ability.","Transmission<br/>Just like a car&#39;s transmission, a manual transmission on a mower means more work for you. If you prefer to focus on steering instead of shifting, you’ll want a riding mower with an automatic transmission.","Warranty<br/>When you’re making a purchase as expensive as a ride-on lawnmower, the warranty period becomes increasingly important. If something goes wrong early in the lifespan of your lawnmower, the warranty can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars on replacing parts or the whole unit. And from our experience, the longer the warranty period, the longer you can expect your products to last.","The most common warranty period for ride-on lawn mowers is two years. Most of the models offer two-year warranties. The longest warranty period we saw was five years offered by the eXmark Lazer Z series.","However, you should check to see if the lawn mower you choose has additional limitations. For example, the John Deere E180’s warranty expires when you’ve used the machine for 120 hours."]},"id":"10317a5c-5823-4cf7-81b8-439338df70f6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_200","url":"/best-riding-lawn-mowers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
