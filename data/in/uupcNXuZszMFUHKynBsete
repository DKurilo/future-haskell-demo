These simple machines also allow you to carry odd-shaped boxes and containers from one place to another. When you use hand trucks, you lessen your risk of straining your back from repetitive lifting. Even if you are carrying a light load, constantly bending and lifting can result in health problems.","Hand trucks come in a variety of designs and are made from several materials. Small hand trucks made from durable plastic or aluminum are often used in home settings, while heavy-duty steel hand trucks are most often used in commercial applications. Some of the most common hand trucks include the <a href=\"#Magna_Cart\">WelCom Magna Cart</a>, the <a href=\"#Milwaukee\">Milwaukee 49180 Hand Truck</a> and the <a href=\"#Wesco\">Wesco Lightweight Folding Truck</a>.","<strong>Hand Trucks: What to Look For</strong>","It&#39;s important to find the right hand truck for the types of loads you will be moving. Trucks come with different designs, materials and load capacities, as well as extra features.","<strong>Design<br/></strong> There are three different hand truck designs: upright, convertible and specialty. Upright trucks are typically suited for loads that weigh less than 500 pounds, although some heavy-duty uprights can move much more. Convertible hand trucks have four wheels instead of two. These trucks are versatile because you can use them like a cart while they are laying down on all four wheels or you can use them like standard upright hand trucks. They are also designed to carry heavier loads. Specialty trucks are made to carry specific items such as machinery, bags, furniture or crates.","<strong>Construction<br/></strong> Hand trucks are made from several different materials. The strongest trucks are usually made from heavy-duty steel. Because steel hand trucks are made to withstand the heaviest loads, they are often reinforced with double welds and have added supports where they experience the most pressure. Aluminum trucks aren&#39;t quite as heavy as steel hand trucks, but they are still strong enough to carry heavy boxes and crates. Sometimes aluminum trucks are bonded with other metals to make them stronger. They are also not as expensive as steel. For very light loads, some hand trucks are made using ultra-light nylon or even fiberglass. Typically these hand trucks are designed for home or office use.","<strong>Load Capacity<br/></strong> When selecting hand trucks, it&#39;s also important to find out the load capacity. Load capacities are listed for safety reasons, and sometimes the limit is displayed somewhere on the hand truck. You should never attempt to put more weight on a hand trucks than it is rated to handle. This can cause the truck to tip over or even break, which can damage expensive items and injure people.","Hand trucks help you move items that would be too heavy otherwise. Because hand trucks have smooth-rolling wheels and durable frames, you can save your back and get the job done quickly and efficiently.","<strong>American Cart &amp; Equipment Multi-Mover XT Review</strong>"]},"id":"8e206a6a-9f05-44df-b66a-ef3237d9629b","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/rjDQt2gtoNffdX2KJRecVV.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The American Cart &amp; Equipment Multi-Mover XT is designed to offer stability when moving heavy loads.

The steel fold-out footplate supports large loads, while the large 10-inch turf wheels should travel over nearly any surface without puncturing them in the middle of moving inventory. The trucks have a handle underneath that makes it possible to pull the dolly forward, or you can use the ergonomic handle that goes across the top to push the load. The large handle is useful for heavier loads. These trucks do not feature a tie-down strap, so you will have to purchase straps if you need to secure boxes or if you want the addition of this safety feature. Also, the back of this hand dolly helps guard against boxes and items falling off the cart during transport.","This hand dolly is capable of moving loads up to 1,000 pounds, which is well above the load capacity of a typical hand truck. The frame is one solid piece, which ensures the longevity of these hand trucks, especially if they are used every day.

The platform is small, but it&#39;s designed to evenly distribute the weight when the hand trucks are tilted back. One convenient feature of these hand trucks is the ability to fold flat when you aren&#39;t using it. The platform folds up and the telescopic handle can be pushed down into the lower portion of the handle. The straps hold the unit compact, so you can place them in a closet or even in the trunk of your car.","These hand trucks are constructed from aluminum, which reduces their weight without significantly compromising durability. The lightweight design also makes it easier for smaller people to maneuver the trucks when carrying heavy loads, because you don&#39;t have the extra weight from the trucks to handle. The wheels themselves are designed from solid rubber to ensure they&#39;ll last, and they are large enough you can pull the trucks up stairs. The rubber from the tires are nonmarking, so they won&#39;t scuff up your office floor, and they are durable enough that they should roll fine over brick, gravel and cement with no issues.","Even though this hand dolly weighs less than 11 pounds, it has a maximum load capacity of 175 pounds. That makes this dolly ideal for moving boxes of office files, books and other smaller items at home or in the office. The lightweight design makes the trucks ideal for smaller people to handle.","The Wesco 220617 aluminum folding hand trucks are designed to help you move loads up to 175 pounds.
