You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Uniden GMR1235-2 is a <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-walkie-talkies\">walkie talkie</a>  that will keep you in contact with others, but it does not offer a lot of extra features. However, it does come with a keypad lock and keystroke tone alert to let you know when you have pressed a key.","While this handie talkie does not come with a rechargeable battery pack, each radio does use three AAA batteries, which are easy to find at most any store. All though we would have liked to have seen this device come with a low battery indicator, we were pleased to find that it does at least have a battery meter. The battery life on this unit is approximately 20 hours. However, keep in mind that it will be much less than that if you are using it quite often. Keeping an eye on your battery is important when you are trying to stay in contact with other people.","The GMR1235-2 walkie talkie comes equipped with the &#34;roger beep.&#34; This feature creates a short tone or beep after the &#34;talk&#34; button has been released for more than a few seconds. This comes in handy when you are in a crowded area and aren&#39;t sure if your other party has finished speaking or not.","This walkie talkie also has automatic channel scan for your convenience. Automatic channel scan will search the available channels and find the best one for you to communicate on. This allows you to spend the time you would have spent searching for a clean channel doing something more fun, like planning to meet your party at the trailhead so you can get started on that hike you&#39;ve been longing for.","For those who like to stay in communication with others while keeping their hands free to do other things, this walkie talkie offers you a headset jack. Simply plug in your headset, and your hands are free to do other important items, while you&#39;re still able to communicate with your other party.","Uniden won&#39;t leave you in a lurch when it comes to help &amp; support for your walkie talkie. They have placed a link to all of their owner manuals on the front page of their website. Also on the front page is a link to their product support pages. They offer a comprehensive list of walkie talkie FAQs, which can be searched by entering a specific question or by browsing all of the topics. If you are unable to find your answer under the FAQs, they offer an email address to their tech support department and the ability to log back into the website to check the status of your questions. It was not difficult to locate a toll free telephone number for technical support, either. Their phone-line hours are Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m."]},"id":"66d22326-18f2-4a12-9048-d671f275529d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c455264f-fcb6-434a-80d5-96dfa70e986a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Uniden GMR1235-2 is a functional walkie talkie, particularly if you are looking for such features as a battery meter and automatic channel scan.
