The Polaris Vac-Sweep 3900 Sport <a href=\"/best-pressure-pool-cleaners\">pressure pool cleaner</a> has a stable three-wheel base, a stainless-steel drive chain and other features that make it a powerful cleaning tool. If you have a pool that is exposed to extra-large debris, or you have a large pool that could benefit from additional filtration and circulation, this may be the right option for your home.","The 3900’s three-jet cleaner not only helps pull additional debris from the pool, it also circulates an additional 40 gallons per minute through the filter bag. The additional filtration means less wear and tear on your pump and supports your skimmer in keeping your pool free of contaminants and bacteria. Its extra-wide tires should ensure better sidewall cleaning. The dual-chamber filter bag has a 5-liter capacity, which reduces wear on your pool’s filter as it catches large debris and silt. The rear sweep hose should help loosen dirt in hard-to-reach areas.","An external backup valve periodically fires to ensure that the cleaner does not get stuck in any corners or on a drain. A quick disconnect attaches conveniently to the return jet. An additional filter screen traps remaining debris before it makes its way to your filter. The overall design should mean that this pressure pool cleaner takes care of you pool maintenance quickly and efficiently.","You cannot run this pool cleaner on your existing backup line. A booster pump is required to power this vacuum. This model is significantly more expensive than similar cleaners and over Polaris pressure-side cleaners. Note also that the bag may fill quickly and could require emptying frequently due to the strength of the jets. If the bag becomes too heavy, it could prevent the cleaner from working efficiently. The machine is not designed to clean any of the step areas. A pressure pool cleaner that is designed to clean steps and other difficult areas is the <a href=\"/poolvergnuegen-review\">Poolvergnuegen PoolCleaner</a>. The Poolvergnuegen also runs on an internal motor so it doesn’t require a booster pump.","The Polaris 3900 is designed to be a powerful pressure pool cleaner. It has a reasonably high price point in this market. Consider its features and if you need to make this large an investment. Its main advantages are its speed and power, which help circulate additional water during its cycle. This could potentially lead to less wear on your filter. A booster pump is required for operation."]},"id":"96f44dc7-7eba-4d7c-a84e-3d57b20d357b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66568","url":"/polaris-vac-sweep-sport-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-14T18:30:20Z","datePublished":"2015-08-14T18:30:20Z","name":"Polaris Vac-Sweep 3900 Sport","synopsis":"Polaris has been in the business of selling pool-cleaning equipment for 40 years.
