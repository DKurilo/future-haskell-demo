This type of debris can often clog parts within the brush and motor and cause burnouts. The Dyson Animal includes a tangle-free, air-driven multi-turbine tool to clean out all surfaces without struggling against pet hair.","The benefit of the Dyson is it makes use of the many innovative features created by the company&#39;s engineers. For example, traditional vacuums often rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. How, tiny holes in the bag can clog up with particles of dust and restrict air flow for reduced performance. Dyson bagless canister vacuum cleaners don&#39;t use bags to trap animal hair and dust. Instead, the vacuum uses cyclones to generate centrifugal forces thousands of times the force of gravity to fling debris straight into the bin without any loss of suction.","The technology used in the radial root cyclone motor has been continuously refined since its initial release 20 years ago, and the changes are quite evident. The Dyson DC39 Animal performs at an incredible level of efficiency, utilizing reconfigured air channels and improved flow efficiency to preserve air pressure and better extract debris from your floor and furniture. The end result is even more dirt, dust, allergens and pet hair is removed and placed within the bin.","The Dyson DC39 Animal is a top rated canister vacuum due to its level of performance in removing pet hair and dander. If you suffer from allergies or simply want to remove the ever-present smell of pet from your floors, this device will surpass all expectations. It contains suction technology that has been constantly improved for decades, which means you can expect it to remove dirt, dust and pet hair from your floors, no problem."]},"id":"3aeaa42f-0c49-41cd-9436-1610cb1623f0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57701","url":"/dyson-animal-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-04T13:32:11Z","datePublished":"2013-10-04T13:32:11Z","name":"Dyson DC39 Animal","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
