You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Capresso EC100 offers you the chance to get creative and add variety to your coffee drinks, not only with espresso shots but also with lattes and cappuccinos using this espresso machine&#39;s two-part frother. This <a href=\"/best-espresso-machines\">espresso maker</a> comes with a frothing sleeve that lets you swirl hot steam and air into your milk to make a rich and foamy topping for your cappuccinos. You can remove the frothing sleeve and use the underlying steam tube that puts hot steam into milk, making it possible to make lattes.","Like the best espresso machines found in restaurants and cafes, the Capresso EC100 uses bar pressure to extract the greatest flavor out of coffee grounds. You can use finely ground coffee, or for greater convenience on a busy morning, you can make use of the pre-packaged espresso coffee pods. You can brew two cups of espresso at the same time, and you can get your cups toasty warm to keep your beverage hot longer by placing them on the stainless steel cup-warming tray on top.","The water reservoir on the back of this espresso maker is clear, so you can easily gauge water levels. You won&#39;t get any metallic taste from the water since it will never come into contact with aluminum, which is a great touch and allows for getting the best espresso maker flavor possible.","The water reservoir is removable, as is the drip tray in front, which is important for making the best home espresso machines easy to clean. Machines that are not cleaned regularly can not only produce bad tasting drinks, but also pose the risk of harboring bacteria.","Unfortunately, the water reservoir and drip tray are not dishwasher safe, so you will have to do some hand-washing to keep this kitchen appliance clean and ready to brew again.","The Capresso EC-100 comes with a generous number of safety features, which you find in the best home espresso machines. These include a short electrical cord so that nothing is dangling down within reach of a youngster&#39;s eager hands, which could pose serious risks to a child. The polarized plug means your espresso maker can only be plugged in one way. Since this model is equipped with on and off indicator lights, it&#39;s easy to tell that your machine is off when you want it to be and not worry about accidents, burns or fire.","You get a full roster of customer support with the Capresso EC-100. If you run into problems, you can contact customer service using a toll-free phone line during business hours or by email. You can also check the Capresso Facebook page to learn more about your espresso maker. You get a one-year warranty with this espresso machine, which is typical for the espresso maker industry.","In addition, the Capresso website offers plenty of data for using this espresso machine. Among other things, it provides a downloadable user manual along with PDF files containing a variety of delicious hot milk frothing recipes so you can prepare such things as different types of teas, soothing milk drinks and several different types of hot chocolate drinks."]},"id":"693a3f33-9371-4179-8023-87281d61aace","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a97c04af-6f85-4aa5-aa46-96eaf5e1e6f7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Capresso EC-100 includes a dual-use swivel steam wand that you can use to make a wide variety of well-flavored, rich-tasting and piping-hot beverages.
