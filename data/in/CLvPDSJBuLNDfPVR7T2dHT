They neatly tuck all the computer components inside the wide monitor or on the base. The Inspiron One 23 is an all-in-one PC that offers something special. Unlike most other all-in-one desktops on the market, this PC has an AV input, both VGA in and out and an S/PDIF connector. These unique ports let you easily connect to older technologies such as VCRs, outdated PCs and a variety of game consoles.","If you&#39;re a retro gamer or can&#39;t break away from your VCR movie collection, you can enjoy your old games and movies on a 23-inch widescreen monitor. With a display resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, you&#39;ll be able to see clear images no matter what you&#39;re viewing.","Keeping with the modern touch, however, this all-in-one desktop PC does have an HDMI-in port so you can connect to Blu-ray and other advanced devices. It does, unfortunately, play it safe by including a DVD drive instead of Blu-ray.","The touchscreen has 10-point functionality, so you can use both hands to navigate by touching the screen directly. You can also share the screen with a coworker or friend to interact on a project or game.","This PC runs with a 3rd generation Intel Core i5-3340s processor with 3.3 GHz of speed. If you like to multitask, the aforementioned specs will be a great tool.You can leave your tabs open freely while viewing music videos without the fear of being slowed down.","With 1TB of hard drive space, you can store an amazing amount on this all-in-one PC from your pictures, movies to music and more. It also comes with four 3.0 USB and two USB 2.0 ports for added connectivity to external devices such as your keyboard, mouse, extra hard drive and more.","Help and support can easily be reached on Dell&#39;s website either by email or phone. There is also a live chat option if you have an urgent problem with your home PC. For added comfort, this PC comes with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"db9f4148-bf40-4395-a519-b1c76b9df53c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aa7cb0cb-6407-429a-9d6e-9a9983b40aec","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Inspiron One 23 is a good all-in-one PC if you&#39;re holding on to your old technology like game consoles and VCRs.
