You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you&#39;re looking for small window air conditioner, the Frigidaire FRA052XT7 will suit you well. With 5,000 BTUs, this mini <a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">AC window unit</a> is capable of cooling up to 150 square feet, which means it will work well for a small bedroom or office.","It comes with two fan settings and two cooling speeds that will ensure your room is always the right temperature. You can move the airflow direction two ways to target the cool air into the areas of the room you want it to go.","The compact size of this window-mounted air conditioner is easy to lift at a weight of only 35 pounds. The air conditioner also includes a window mounting kit with straightforward directions for simple installation. The unit has optional side panels that can be extended for the perfect fit in your window.","The Effortless Clean filter reduces the bacteria and other airborne particles in the room, freshening your air as it cools. The filter is removable for easy cleaning and maintenance.","An automatic restart function will restart your unit at its previous settings if you&#39;re faced with a power outage. The quick cool capability will cool your space down fast, making this window unit particularly useful on an exceptionally hot day. The 24 hour timer allows you to set the AC window unit to turn on and off automatically, depending on your needs. You can shut off the unit during the day when you&#39;re away at work and have it automatically turn on when you return home, so you&#39;re not wasting unnecessary energy."]},"id":"08fefa3d-0d8a-4f09-820f-12ecd4e703ed","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/YpTHWjzHfDW7pXJrKakkPm.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57209-frigidaire-fra052xt73.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YpTHWjzHfDW7pXJrKakkPm.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"YpTHWjzHfDW7pXJrKakkPm","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YpTHWjzHfDW7pXJrKakkPm.jpg","alt":""},"id":"049c4fd3-3b4e-4f60-93fe-c2feadd43bd5","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The quiet operation makes this mini air conditioner a great addition to a bedroom or office because it won’t disturb you if you&#39;re sleeping or working from home. Once the AC unit reaches your preferred temperature, it will switch the compressor on and off to maintain the current cool.","Keep in mind, however, that this AC window unit has mechanical controls located on the bottom left side, and it does not come with a remote, which means you won&#39;t be able to adjust the temperature or other settings from a distance.","There&#39;s no need to battle the heat on your own. If you want to stay cool this summer the Frigidaire FRA052XT7 can help. This compact air conditioner works well in a small room. For its size, it offers some excellent features, like an antibacterial mesh filter and a quick-cool function."]},"id":"761e65f1-a1c4-4d02-bf1e-315276b25c49","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57237","url":"/frigidaire-fra052xt7-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-08-08T19:37:24Z","datePublished":"2013-08-08T19:37:24Z","name":"Frigidaire FRA052XT7","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-08-08T19:37:24Z","id":"VBMMmabLMv6wdH5b6aoraW","meta":{"title":"Frigidaire FRA052XT7 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"With the Frigidaire FRA052XT7 AC window unit, you&#039;re sure to stay cool all season long.
