She told me white noise settings are most likely to mask noise the best, but also suggested that not every baby perceives white noise as a calming tone. She also suggests avoiding sound profiles with thunder claps or chirping birds because, “Any abrupt or loud sound will probably cause a startle.”","<a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/should-you-hush-white-noise\">This article</a> outlines the potential advantages and disadvantages of using a sound machine to help your baby fall asleep and stay asleep longer.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We performed two audio tests to see how the sound machines we reviewed masked external noise and to check that they don’t have startling noises. To test the sound masking capabilities of each product, a reviewer listened to the white noise setting on one sound machine in our test lab, while another reviewer used a vacuum cleaner, blender or played music on a stereo, in the adjacent room. The sound machines were all set to transmit white noise at 75 dB for this test, which is sufficiently loud without harming an infant’s hearing. The reviewer inside the test lab then recorded each occurrence and volume level of any outside noises they heard. Our final grades were issued based on how well each sound machine masked those external noises."]},"id":"bd951250-2bd5-4a2f-b1a3-529884dc944e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/jjigeNJm45ZSUE3JZ7HD2D.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/baby-sound-machine-testing/w/711/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9UL1gvNzk5NDEzL29yaWdpbmFsL0JhYnktU291bmQtTWFjaGluZXMtVGVzdGluZy0wMDMuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jjigeNJm45ZSUE3JZ7HD2D.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"jjigeNJm45ZSUE3JZ7HD2D","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jjigeNJm45ZSUE3JZ7HD2D.jpg","alt":""},"id":"8e42f13c-2c74-4934-bcd8-40d4dbfe37b0","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/>We determined a sound quality grade by listening to the heartbeat sound profile from every sound machine.

We made note of any durability issues in the individual product reviews.","<strong>How Much Does a Baby Sound Machine Cost? </strong>","Simple sound machines with lullaby and nature profiles start in the $20 range, but for accompanying visual aids, expect to pay around $30. Sound machines that are integrated into a stuffed animal are a bit more expensive at around $40. The audio quality and sound masking capabilities of the cuddly stuffed animal sound machines aren’t on par with other products we tested, but you can remove the sound module if your child gets attached to the stuffed animal.","<strong>Important Features to Consider </strong>","Image Projector and Nightlight<br/>Projecting an image on a wall or ceiling in your nursery room helps calm your baby and gives them something to look at while they doze off. Image projectors also serve as nightlights, which allow you to check on your baby without turning the lights on and disturbing their sleep.","Timer<br/>Sleep timers slowly wean your baby off the need to have calming noises during sleep. By letting the device turn off after a designated period of time, your baby is gradually exposed to normal environmental sounds while they sleep and decrease their reliance on the sound machine as they get older.","Power Options<br/>If you plan to add a sound machine to your travel kit, consider a product that is powered by batteries. Some sound machines come with an AC adapter, and you should use that when possible, but when you want to use your sound machine in a place that doesn’t have a wall socket, like in the car or on a camping trip, battery-powered devices are essential. The best sound machines have both power options.","<strong>Sound Machine Mobile Apps </strong>","The baby sound machines we tested are perfect for helping your child fall asleep – and stay asleep – in a home nursery or the car. However, if you forget to pack the sound machine for a road trip or you encounter a fussy moment while on the go, a sound machine mobile app is a great temporary replacement for the best baby sound machines we reviewed. Here are some of our favorite sound machine mobile apps.","<a href=\"https://www.tmsoft.com/white-noise/\">White Noise Lite</a><br/>This free sound machine app is available for Android, iOS and Amazon mobile devices. It has 40 sound profiles, including soothing nature sounds and a variety of other noises. You can also use this app to record customized sound profiles – for example, the noise from a park near your home. The paid version has more alarm settings and full stereo sound, but the Lite version still gives you access to a large library of free downloadable sounds.","<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rain-rain/id478687481\">Rain Rain</a><br/>This free app has more than 25 sounds, including purring cats, thunderstorms and rain. It works on iOS and Android devices and includes a helpful sleep timer that you can set for up to 25 hours. Choose from the sound profiles included with the app, or build your own by combining nature and white-noise profiles. Rain Rain has a calming, pulsating effect that gently fades the volume of any profile up and down.
