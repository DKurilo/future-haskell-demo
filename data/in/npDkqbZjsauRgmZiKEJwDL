The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/science/best-weather-stations/\">Weather Stations</a> here.</em>","The ProWeatherStation TP2700WC measures multiple parameters and connects to your computer for data logging. This cost-effective personal weather station device with solar sensor makes data analysis possible.","It includes a backlit liquid crystal display, a solar-powered sensor and a cable that connects it to your computer. The manufacturer&#39;s WeatherSmart software enables you to upload data in real time to Weather Underground from the weather station.","The base station operates using a 5-volt AC power adapter, a USB plug-in or uses three AA lithium or alkaline batteries. The batteries and AC adapter are not included in this personal weather station. The sensor uses solar power to augment two AA batteries and allows the unit to work even if solar input is not consistent, allowing you to place the sensor where it is most needed.","The clock is radio controlled and linked to the time signal at Fort Collins, Colorado, for accuracy. It is set according to your local time, and an optional feature for daylight savings time comes with this weather station. You may choose between a 12-hour or 24-hour format. Illuminance in lux, foot-candles or watts/m2 is available. You are able to choose between Celsius or Fahrenheit temperature measurements with this personal weather station, and barometric pressure is in mmHg or inHg. The unit also allows adjustment of the rainy season to accommodate local differences.","The unit provides alarms for humidity, temperature, dew point, wind chill, wind gusts and speed. Barometric pressure, heat and UV index also have alarm settings. The alarm lasts for up to 120 seconds in this weather station.","This wireless weather station operates at a frequency of 433MHz, and the sensor updates every 48 seconds. The distance from the base station to the sensor should not exceed 300 feet.","The base station is charcoal gray and is mountable on the wall or usable on the desktop. The system includes a rain gauge that empties automatically. Data logging allows up to 4,800 readings.","The ProWeatherStation TP2700WC is a complete wireless weather station. It has many useful features as well as the ability to log data over time and a solar-augmented sensor. The computer link enables it to analyze the data in more depth than many other systems. This unit may satisfy your needs at a midrange price."]},"id":"b128f8f9-044b-425a-b214-7d130e2137cc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63344","url":"/proweatherstation-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-09T19:47:50Z","datePublished":"2015-03-09T19:47:50Z","name":"ProWeather Station TP2700WC","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-09T19:47:50Z","id":"npDkqbZjsauRgmZiKEJwDL","meta":{"title":"ProWeather Station TP2700WC Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The ProWeatherStation TP2700WC weather station provides multiple weather details and includes software.
