Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The ProForm brand has a reputation for creating the best treadmills that offer you limitless fitness possibilities. In line with this vision, the ProForm Performance 1450 bursts at the seams with amazing features and functions. You and your entire family will yearn to walk or run your way to meeting and even exceeding your fitness goals. This ProForm <a href=\"/best-treadmills\">treadmill</a> has incorporated everything you need to create your ideal workout, providing you with top-of-the-line quality and technology.","Many worthwhile features come with this ProForm Treadmill. The 3.25-horsepower Commercial Pro motor can propel the 20-inch by 60-inch belt at speeds up to 12 mph in increments of 0.1 mph. If you prefer incline running, this motorized treadmill&#39;s deck can elevate to around 15 percent. This treadmill does not have a decline setting, which makes it less suitable for cross training than some other products in our treadmill reviews.","With 28 built-in workout programs, this treadmill is equipped to provide you with a variety of running simulations for your needs. With iFit integration, you can have as many users as possible if you subscribe to that service. With iFit, you can create custom programs that complement existing workouts. Goal-oriented programs for weight loss, heart rate and other fitness goals are also available.","The speed and incline controls are deceptively simple. Quick-access buttons give you full control of the machine with just one touch. The ProForm Performance 1450 tracks your heart rate via the hand sensors to help you monitor and maintain your target heart rate. This treadmill doesn’t have wireless heart monitor functionality. The running deck has heavy-duty shock absorbers to reduce the impact on your knees and other joints when you run. The Commercial Pro motor provides you with a smooth, quiet run.","The LCD touchscreen, speakers and audio input make this one of the most advanced treadmills on our lineup. With these extras, you can use your favorite media to stay productive or entertained as you exercise. The integrated AutoBreeze Fan changes speed automatically as you run and keeps up with your activity levels. The fan also has low, medium and high settings if you do not wish to use the automatic setting. This feature really sets the ProForm Performance 1450 apart from its competitors. Whether you enjoy road running or low-impact training, the adjustable cushioning is great for helping you train in a variety of situations.","When you&#39;re not using the treadmill, it safely and securely folds up to give you more space in your home. This folding treadmill&#39;s integration with iFit brings you another way to exercise – interactive video workouts. These video workouts let you run in famous locations around the world from Paris to New York and more. With these exciting workouts, you&#39;ll be less likely to dread your workout.","ProForm is known for its iconic exercise equipment but you&#39;ll also appreciate the lifetime warranty that covers the Performance 1450 treadmill motor and frame. The electronics and parts share a five-year warranty. There is also a two-year labor warranty. With this warranty, you&#39;ll be sure that you can easily take care of your investment and get years of quality use.","The ProForm Performance 1450&#39;s greatness does not stop with its features and warranty; its help and support options are also impressive. ProForm provides live chat support on every page of its website, which is the fastest technical support option available. You can also contact technical support via email and telephone. In the support section of the website, you will find a FAQs section and an excellent PDF user manual."]},"id":"654f4733-827b-44b7-818f-9bf269107506","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fb4cec38-3747-4bce-971e-6999aa305d8b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ProForm Performance 1450 treadmill is truly an incredible running machine.
