You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Haier HLP21N is a lightweight and easily transported portable washing machine that offers exceptional convenience if you live in a small space. This trim model weighs a mere 43 pounds, which is the lightest of all the washers in our product lineup. It stands only 32.5 inches high and is 17.6 inches wide and 17.3 inches deep, which makes it exceptionally easy to store. The dimensions of this portable machine make it a good fit for apartments and homes with tight storage. The rolling casters on the bottom of the unit also make it easy to move from room to room.","However, its small size does result in a smaller load capacity. At most, you can comfortably fit 1 cubic foot of laundry in this washing machine. At its maximum spin, this Haier model can reach 700 rpm, which is a bit lower than many models in our lineup, but it does work well as far as removing moisture from clothing, especially for such a compact machine .","This is a reasonably inexpensive portable washer to operate. You can expect this model to use about 214 kilowatts of electricity per year with normal use, which costs only about $23 a year. That translates into a monthly expense of $1.92, which is a bit higher than our most energy efficient models, but is certainly less costly than lugging clothes to the laundromat.","This portable washing machine only has three wash cycles and water level settings. The settings are vague as well and lack a delicate or soak cycle. When washing your clothes, you can choose from a heavy, quick or spin-only cycle.","As with all the best portable washing machines, setup only takes a couple steps with this Haier model. The quick sink hookups connect to your kitchen, bathroom or laundry room sink. You only have to add the connector and place the drain hose in the sink before you begin a wash cycle.","This washer is missing some standard features. Of the features we looked for in the best portable washers, the Haier only had an end-of-cycle signal. While this is a useful quality in a washing machine, this model is still missing a time-remaining indicator, delay start and a detergent dispenser.","In case of malfunctions or broken parts, this washer has a parts and labor warranty for an entire year. The Haier website provides a downloadable PDF as well, in case you lose your hard copy. If you have questions, customer support is available via email and phone. For quick answers, the FAQs section on the Haier website is full of common questions and answers."]},"id":"3b660baf-6c63-4d69-a152-b0ed92a569f1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a96d519b-1720-47f4-a60a-b98c18e77111","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Depending on your priorities for a portable washer, the Haier HLP21N may be a perfect fit. It has the fewest wash cycles and water level options of any washing machine in our lineup.
