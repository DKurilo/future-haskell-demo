This reduces wear and tear on the filter and motor, so the vacuum works well for a long time. Bissell includes a one-year warranty on the PowerForce.","This upright vacuum weighs only 15 pounds and stands 44 inches tall. It has a 13.5-inch cleaning path and dual edge cleaning that lets you vacuum close to walls and furniture. Five height settings allow you to optimize airflow and suction on any type of carpet, and a soft bumper protects your furniture and walls against scratches and bumps.","You can use the PowerForce Helix to clean hard floors using the bare floor height setting, but there is no way to shut off the brush. This model comes with a combination dusting brush and upholstery tool, as well as a flexible crevice tool, and they both connect to an extension wand so you can easily reach high and low surfaces. Other tools, such as a turbo brush, a furniture tool and a long reach dusting tool, are also available separately from Bissell for this machine. The power cord on this vacuum is 20 feet long, giving you a good cleaning area without having to move the plug.","Like other bagless models, the Helix collects dirt in the dust cup. This eliminates the need for buying bags for your vacuum. This model boasts a large collection cup so you can do more cleaning and less emptying. Filtration on this vacuum includes a HEPA media exhaust filter, to keep fine dust and allergens from going back out into the air.","The Bissell PowerForce Helix is a full-powered vacuum at a very low cost.  A standard set of hand tools and height adjustment settings allow you to use this vacuum to clean and dust a wide range of surfaces in your home. The HEPA filtration is an added bonus, especially if you have allergies or asthma."]},"id":"073d2d76-1220-4492-aea0-b428fc95529a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59988","url":"/bissell-powerforce-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-15T15:53:50Z","datePublished":"2014-07-15T15:53:50Z","name":"Bissell","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
