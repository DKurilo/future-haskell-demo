Cues display the letters with hints on how to type them. Keys that are in the home row, for example, are displayed in the middle line, while keys above the home row are slightly higher, and keys below the home row are placed slightly lower. Finger cues color-code the letters to indicate which finger should strike each key. Reach cues show which letters are out of the finger’s “natural column” of keys, while shift cues display which keys must be combined with the shift key to strike. If all the colors and key placements are confusing, the cues can be turned off.","Users can also customize thresholds at which a lesson or test (called “drills” in this particular Mac typing software program) automatically restarts. Thresholds can be set for when a user dips below a certain WPM rate or reaches a certain number of errors.","Unfortunately, multiple users cannot save individual data with CueType. More than one person can use the program, of course, but the performance reports will reflect results from all users at once. This is one of only two pieces of Mac typing software that had this disappointing drawback, but with all its other positive attributes, we feel this detail can be overlooked.","Text size is adjustable, which is a surprisingly rare feature among the other Mac typing software programs we reviewed. This handy option reduces eye strain and provides a more comfortable learning environment for users who have poor vision.","One other unique feature, which we did not find in any other Mac typing software program we reviewed, is the “ghost hands” tool. This option lets the computer type the keys at a set 30 WPM so users can watch the keyboard visual to see where each key is located and how it should be typed. This feature certainly makes up for the lack of guided help through audio or video dictation. (Though this is not to say that there is no guided help; to learn more information about the keys in any drill, simply click “Drill Info” to view a textual explanation.)"]},"id":"379494b1-2716-4921-a382-567e1ad5a469","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Games, Lessons and Tests"},"id":"9cc6acd9-74c5-4814-a8c9-0a6f316dd426","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/PnB8jMgz6cvofKMynijdSE.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"As we said, CueType offers no typing games with which to practice skills learned in lessons.
