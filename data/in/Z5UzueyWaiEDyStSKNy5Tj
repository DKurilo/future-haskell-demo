Its simple design gives it a rather unassuming appearance, though the device surprises many users with its powerful wattage and heat output.

While slightly larger than other compact dryers, this unit packs 1875 watts of power that can be controlled through two temperature settings and two speed settings.","The area where the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic truly shines is through its heating element. By relying on modern technological advances, Revlon has created a tourmaline ionic heating unit. This portable hair dryer relies on the production of negatively charged ion particles to not only keep your hair frizz-free, but also ensure the ongoing hydration of your hair for reduced overall damage.","Additional accessories extend the range of use for the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic. A rotating concentrator nozzle creates precision airflow to quickly dry specific damp spots. In addition, a finger diffuser is included to reduce frizz and increase hair volume all at once. These are among the most standard of accessories among even the best blow dryers and perform quite well for drying hair daily without contributing further damage.","The Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic comes with a two-year warranty, nearly double the protection of other dryers on the market. Revlon is a big name in beauty-care products, and so it has the resources needed to defend against manufacturer defects. Whether the heating element or the electrical wiring fails, this warranty has you covered.","The Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic sets itself apart as one of the highest-performing tourmaline blow dryers on the market. It dries even the thickest hair in almost half the time of other ionic dryers, and is still incredibly quiet. Combined with the low price tag and lightweight design, this device proves itself as a reliable and invaluable beauty-care aid for any individual."]},"id":"b9c36e8b-9cf9-40f6-9f93-f116d425082a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58176","url":"/revlon-1875w-tourmaline-ionic-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-14T20:58:39Z","datePublished":"2013-11-14T20:58:39Z","name":"Revlon Tourmaline Ionic 1875W","synopsis":"Editor's note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
