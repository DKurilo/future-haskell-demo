All you do is simply adjust the number of servings and the software does the rest. Additionally, once you have the cost of grocery items entered into the software’s database, you can create a shopping list complete with the total estimated cost of the ingredients you need.","AccuChef lacks a few conveniences of the best recipe software, such as a smartphone app, and it has a seriously outdated interface. However, you get enough features with this basic cookbook software to make it a useful kitchen companion.","For one thing, you get meal-planning capabilities that let you plan dishes weeks in advance. With this program, you can enter a few ingredients that you have on hand and the application will search the database to find matching recipes. You can also scan all of your recipes at once, because they are listed in alphabetical order, and you can add photos to make them attractive and flag your favorites.","If you’re looking internet food sites, you can import a recipe by copying it and using the import wizard to paste it into the application. AccuChef also provides a nutritional analyzer using a U.S. Department of Agriculture database so you can figure out the nutritional value of a particular dish, and you can print nutrition labels as well.","When you add recipes to the menu planner, they are marked, which comes in handy when you want to create a quick shopping list. If you simply click on the Shopping List button, all of the marked recipes will be added to the list. You can also find a Process button in the menu-planning section that groups similar items together to make shopping for your ingredients more convenient, as you can see what items you can get from the same aisles. AccuChef estimates the cost of a recipe as a whole and per serving. However, many common items such as olive oil, rosemary and garlic cloves do not have cost information, so you must enter these manually.","You also get a fun feature from AccuChef that allows you to create hard copies of your favorite recipes to keep in your own kitchen or share with family and friends.","This recipe software has a FAQs section to help you use the program, as well as email support. There is also a network option that allows you to share this application on multiple computers in your household."]},"id":"badbded0-254d-4a0e-861b-0eaefb40d4b5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"208d8043-91eb-4305-b14e-fb5d543d8bd0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite its outdated interface and the lack of a smartphone app, AccuChef can be a solid, basic helpmate in the kitchen with its recipe importation capabilities, nutritional analysis and help with estimated costs for groceries."]},"id":"bb43ef69-5ae9-4db5-9c9d-99b227bd82cb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_225","url":"/accuchef-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2017-09-22T00:00:00Z","name":"AccuChef 6.7","synopsis":"One of the best features of AccuChef cookbook and recipe software is the easy way it lets you scale recipes if the number of people at your dinner table is about to change.
