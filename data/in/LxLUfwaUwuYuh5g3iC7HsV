You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you’re thinking the higher price point and smaller capacity spells disaster for the GE WCVH4800KWW, you are mostly wrong. This GE <a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\">front-load washer</a>  is not the best in our lineup, but it does offer some good qualities. For instance, the smaller capacity helps it score some energy savings. If you are part of a small household, you may not need a front-load washer with an extra-large capacity in the long run.","Push-button controls and an LED display make this GE machine’s operations easy to track, and with up to 1,400 rotations per minute as a spin speed, your drying time for clothing from this washer will be minimal. You can also rely on those hallmark features of front-loading machines – an automatic dispenser, time delay start and end-of-cycle signal.","This GE machine also bumps up temperatures to sanitization levels, which is important to many consumers. Those hot temperatures are hard on fabrics, but the higher they go the more bacteria they kill.","GE addresses the infamous front-loader problems of vibration and mildew with the AutoBalance Suspension System and BasketClean cycle, respectively. These should keep your basket fresh and your sound and vibration levels low. We like when manufacturers resolve our concerns right out of the gate.","This GE machine can be purchased with a matching pedestal, so you don’t have to bend so far to get to your clean clothing. This machine adjusts water levels automatically to gauge your load’s size, so you never waste a drop of water. The child lock feature will disable buttons and prevent small hands from interfering with the machine’s operation.","We love the reversible door hinge on this GE front-load washer. That will be invaluable for configuring your laundry room just the way you want it. This machine is relatively petite and ultra-stackable too, which will give you even more options. There are even a couple of color options. Those with open floor plans will be able to make their overall designs stylish and coherent.","The energy savings with this GE machine are significant. Expect to pay only $13 annually to operate it with an electric water heater and a measly $8 a year with a gas water heater.","This GE front-load washer has a fairly solid, standard warranty. The parts, labor and motor are covered for one year from the date of purchase. The customer support from GE seems fine but not great. Their website is helpful but not spectacular. Customers are asked to navigate a knowledge base maze before asking for actual help. Live chat also would go such a long way to improve customer service on this manufacturer’s site."]},"id":"db2127d9-3c6c-4cd0-a8dd-f4ead0117cc0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"171b90ec-0bee-4e0f-baf2-d97884698c5d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though still larger and quieter and more energy efficient than many top-loading machines, the GE WCVH4800KWW  front-load washer is not going to be the best option for most users.
