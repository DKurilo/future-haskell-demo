With a basic <a href=\"/best-online-stock-trading-brokers\">online broker account</a>, you can typically trade on a set schedule or execute individual transactions whenever you choose. You also have access to a variety of on line trading tools, such as historical performance charts for stocks in companies that interest you and the ability to compare mutual funds.","With more than a dozen on line brokers waiting to facilitate all types of trades and collect the fees that go with them, it pays to do your homework. First, understand what you want to buy and sell, and second, review the pricing or fee schedule that each broker provides to be sure that you are comfortable with what you ll be paying for each transaction.","Start with the minimum investment needed to open an on line trading account. To make trading access easy and available to as many people as possible, most on line brokers do not require a minimum initial investment. Others require an opening investment of approximately $500 to $1,000 to open an account. At least one on line broker allows you to open an account with an initial stock purchase of any amount as long as you set up automatic, regular purchases.","Most new investors choose to use an on line trading account to buy and sell stocks. The fee per on line trade is typically much lower than fees charged by traditional brokerage houses, but this is partially because you are trading on your own without any advice. If you re not confident in researching and choosing which stocks to buy and sell, on line trading might not be the best option for you. However, if you re comfortable steering your own investment ship, on line stock purchasing will save you a considerable amount in trading fees over time.","If you&#39;re more interested in bonds, buying and selling them online saves you money on transaction fees that retail bond sellers typically charge. Make sure your potential on line broker offers bond-buying services because only a few sites allow you to make bond purchases. Those that do typically offer information to help you choose bonds based on how long you want to hold them.","If you want to trade mutual funds on line, all on line brokers provide this service as part of a basic account, though transaction fees vary depending on the type of mutual fund. If you purchase shares in a no-load mutual fund or a fund that does not carry an upfront sales commission for the mutual fund company itself, you typically will not pay any fees for the purchase. However, if you trade shares in a load fund, you can expect to be charged at either the time of purchase or sale. Look for the on line broker&#39;s fee or pricing schedule to determine the fees for all mutual fund trading.","Finally, you can trade stock options on line if your account is approved for this activity. Options are contracts that allow you to buy or sell particular securities on or before a specified date at a specific price. Options trading is a complex, high-risk activity, but you can carry out options trading with all on line trading brokers. You ll pay a basic fee per options trade plus a small additional fee per contract.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "]},"id":"05426fb8-9986-4280-8418-f9764e222773","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6000","url":"/on-line-trading","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-hicks","url":"/author/jennifer-hicks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Hicks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"m6DJLsYwJmcJdjxe4yY9kY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-05-19T17:41:01Z","datePublished":"2011-05-19T17:41:01Z","name":"On Line Trading","synopsis":"On line trading includes a broad range of activities, such as buying and selling stocks, bonds, stock options and mutual funds.","review":{},"strapline":"On line trading includes a broad range of activities, such as buying and selling stocks, bonds, stock options and mutual funds.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-05-19T17:46:40Z","id":"ipt9jaDzQfeqfLjUEb4vgb","meta":{"title":"On Line Trading","description":"Online brokers give you easy, affordable access to services that allow you to trade stocks, bonds, stock options and mutual funds online."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T21:14:24Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/rjDZo6i8VJy7BudEVcCrdX.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:14:24Z","mimeType":"","name":"6000-on-line-trading.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6000-on-line-trading.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:14:24Z","id":"rjDZo6i8VJy7BudEVcCrdX","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rjDZo6i8VJy7BudEVcCrdX.jpg","alt":""},"title":"On Line Trading","description":"Online brokers give you easy, affordable access to services that allow you to trade stocks, bonds, stock options and mutual funds online."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/rjDZo6i8VJy7BudEVcCrdX.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:14:24Z","mimeType":"","name":"6000-on-line-trading.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6000-on-line-trading.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:14:24Z","id":"rjDZo6i8VJy7BudEVcCrdX","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rjDZo6i8VJy7BudEVcCrdX.jpg","alt":""},"title":"On Line Trading","description":"Online brokers give you easy, affordable access to services that allow you to trade stocks, bonds, stock options and mutual funds online."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/money/articles/on-line-trading/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"money","url":"/money","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T21:14:24Z","name":"Money","dateModified":"2019-04-17T21:14:24Z","id":"7ab7hwbYE9eUwjGQbWRzQC","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
