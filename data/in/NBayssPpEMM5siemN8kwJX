You can add additional information about each contact, including images and birthdates. Gmail is one of the few free email services that directly import social media contacts from your account into your email account.","You can redirect your other email accounts into your Gmail inbox, so you can read all your messages in one place. You can also create alias accounts to use for online shopping or online gaming without using your primary email address.","Gmail also has a preset folder for social and promotion messages. When you enable these, any email notices you get about your social media accounts will automatically be collected in the social folder. If you use your free email address to sign up for newsletters or other online subscriptions, notices from these will automatically be redirected to the promotions folder. This helps keep only your most important messages in your primary inbox.","Gmail supports IMAP, so if you download messages to a desktop email account your messages will still be available on to see through the website. Without this capability, any message downloaded to your desktop would be automatically deleted online.","Your free Gmail account includes 15GB of inbox storage space. This is one of the lowest of the free email accounts we reviewed, but it still gives you enough space to save around 300,000 email messages, and you can choose to pay for more storage if you need it. Because your Gmail account doubles as your Google account login, you have additional storage through the Google One Drive that is connected to your Gmail account. This gives you unlimited storage for Docs, Sheets or Slides that you create using Google Drive, or 15GB of storage space for storing documents, messages or images created using a program other than Google Drive.","One great feature is Gmail’s message translator. When you receive a message in a language other than your set language, Google Translate displays it in a language you can read and understand. This is a great and valuable tool if you have family, friends or even co-workers or clients, that speak and read a language you don’t.","As part of our testing, we checked out the Gmail mobile app. It took us a little while to figure out where all the tools and function were located since some of them are not located in the same places as the web version of this email service, but it became easier as we got used to the interface."]},"id":"b9cd22d5-9c77-4a3f-822a-010a55da657b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Composition Tools"},"id":"e0a76c87-7b82-43ba-92b4-6b21ce1d981a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/LgF3vt3zWdBBc9nWivhhNc.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Gmail has all the composition tools you’d need in a free service.
