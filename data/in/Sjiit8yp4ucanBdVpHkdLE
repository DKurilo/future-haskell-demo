The SUAOKI Portable Power Station is different in that it is essentially a large rechargeable battery that you can take wherever you want. It creates no noise, only weighs four pounds and produces no exhaust from burning fuel. But there are some issues that keep it from being the best portable generator you can buy.","This is a small, compact generator that’s easy to move, transport and store. It weighs a scant four pounds. Other models we reviewed can be as heavy as 240 pounds. Its top handles make it easy to pick up move to wherever its needed. <br/>But as you would expect from a device this size, it doesn’t put out very much power. It’s rated at 150 running watts, which compared to the 5,500-watt range of other models, is wimpy by comparison.","Since this portable generator doesn’t run on gasoline, you’ll need to charge it through the outlets in your home. This takes about eight hours, so you’ll want to do it overnight if you plan to use it on a certain day. SUAOKI doesn’t list how long you can expect it to last on a full charge, but it does include a gauge on top, so you can see how much juice is left.","The biggest problem with this model when compared to other portable generator is its relative lack of outlets. It only has 2 household style outlets for things small electronics like TVs, lights and even a microwave. Other products we reviewed have outlets that will power larger appliances, making them great power backups for the whole home. This model’s design simply doesn’t allow for that.","However, this generator does come with four USB outlets, which is great because you can charge almost all your mobile devices on it. You can plug in a tablet, smartphone or anything that charges through USB into it. This is perfect if you’re going camping or a long road trip and everyone wants to keep their devices charged. It also has four car cigarette-lighter style ports for devices that charge that way, making it an even more attractive option to take on the road.","One other thing worth mentioning is this model’s warranty period. It’s only 18 months, which is the shortest among the generators in our review. Others had warranties as long as 3 years. And while this isn’t necessarily a deal breaker, in our experience, the longer the warranty period, the longer you can expect a product to last.","This portable generator is essentially a large battery pack. It’s good to take on the road, or just have around in case of a minor power outage. You shouldn’t expect it to take on heavy-duty tasks or be compatible with large appliances, but for short term use, it’s a great buy. You may even want to consider having one ready-to-go in your car trunk or closet for those just-in-case situations."]},"id":"3c390f52-8873-4316-aeec-9beaac7157c7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70168","url":"/suaoki-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
