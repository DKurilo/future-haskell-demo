This service allows you to rent or purchase your equipment. The company recommends that you buy the equipment if you are planning to need automatic <a href=\"/best-fall-detection-sensors\">fall detection</a> for three years or more.","The fall alert system comes with a base station and a wearable fall detection pendant. The pendant is small and waterproof, and it can be worn around your neck at all times, including when bathing. In our tests, the pendant accurately responded to the majority of falls with 70 percent accuracy.","The fall detection technology alerts the base unit as long as you are within range of the base unit. In our tests, the base unit&#39;s battery life was 24 hours, about average in comparison with the companies on our lineup. Unfortunately, this service only offers support in English and encourages users who are non-English speakers to learn how to request help in English.","In our range tests, Rapid Response technology performed below average. In the maximum distance test, the pendant reached 250 feet; in the indoor test, it reached a distance of 225 feet. While the overall distance is quite low, this device was able to maintain an almost equally strong signal in the indoor tests, which had much more interference than the open-range test.","The fall detection system is available through a rental subscription plan of either six or twelve months at a time. The longer you sign up for, the less the service costs per month. While Rapid Response does not charge an activation or equipment delivery fee, it is the only service on our lineup that charges a cancelation fee.","Rapid Response provides above-average customer support, with a service score of 90 percent. Representatives were helpful and friendly over the phone and answered our reviewers&#39; questions without trying to push a sale or a package upgrade. You can contact support over the phone and via email, but the company does not offer live chat.","While Rapid Response offers premium features, it has one of the smallest selections of add-on options. For a fee, you can add mobile GPS, a lockbox, and fire and smoke monitoring. While most services offer four or more premium features to choose from, these three are the only ones available through this fall detection system provider. This service is a good option if you need a basic fall detection system and do not need a lot of additional features, like cellular service or CO monitoring."]},"id":"ac3c193c-c4ac-4349-a7cd-1ea1e55453ac","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e0f93844-94ce-4a94-8771-9449b49e1472","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Rapid Response provides basic, reliable fall detection service.
