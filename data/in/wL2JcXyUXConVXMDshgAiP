While GE&#39;s traditional, agitator-equipped top-load washers can&#39;t compete with high-efficiency models when it comes to saving water and electricity, or their timesaving convenience features, the GE Traditional Washer holds up well against its traditional cousins.","This top-loader has a capacity of 3.9 cubic feet, which is large enough for family-size loads. While it does use an agitator to clean laundry – that tall rotor in the middle of the basket that has been replaced by the gentler impeller in newer washers – the agitator employs GE&#39;s HydroWave wash system, which the company claims improves cleaning performance and does so gently. The gentleness comes at a price: most of the wash cycles seem to take more than an hour to complete.","This unit&#39;s maximum spin speed is 700 rpm, which is the slowest of any model we looked at. However, in most cases, it should still wring out clothes just fine, especially if you have time to put loads through the extra spin cycle. It&#39;s best used away from the living area of the house, as its lack of anti-vibration system or other insulation makes it louder than some competing units.","This washer has six wash/rinse temperature combinations for maximum control over your laundry. It automatically fills to five different water levels based on your load size. It has 16 wash cycles, although some of them are a little redundant – for example, three are regular/cotton cycles differentiated only by soil level. There are two auto-soak options, a prewash cycle for stubborn stains and the option of a second rinse to more thoroughly remove allergens and detergent for those with sensitive skin.","This is the only agitator-style unit we looked at that is Energy Star certified. It uses more energy than high-efficiency washers, but its power consumption is still rather conservative compared to other traditional washers. When used with an electric water heater, this unit is estimated to cost about $22 per year in electricity. With a natural-gas water heater, the annual cost for electricity is about $15."]},"id":"9fb28593-0826-4b1d-afa8-ef58a3b7f08f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c9e65c06-750b-4c18-8732-67b45a0140af","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you have had bad experiences with impeller-style washing machines and want to purchase another agitator machine, the GE Traditional Washer might be a good bet.
