The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\">GPS Trackers</a> here.</em>","The Caref GPS Phone Watch is a GPS tracker with voice-to-voice capability. Measured either by the two-year cost of ownership or by initial cost, this is one of the most affordable GPS trackers on the market. It&#39;s also one of the most functional.","This is one of two GPS trackers we tested with a watch form. The watch has a rubber strap with plenty of holes that allow both kids and adults to wear it. It looks like a plain black digital watch, albeit a thick one.","The watch works by obtaining its location via GPS satellites and transmitting that information every 10 minutes to a server using the T-Mobile cellular network. You can then check the watch&#39;s location on a map in Caref&#39;s Apple or Android app. The app is one of the best we tested, with a clean, intuitive layout.","Inside the app, you can manually ping the watch at any time and check the history of where the watch has been. You can also set zones, which will alert you when the watch goes in or out of an area.","But the best feature of this GPS tracker is its basic phone capabilities. The watch is assigned a phone number and can receive calls or texts. It can also call up to three emergency contacts. This is important if you have a child who is too young for a smartphone but you still want to know their whereabouts. The watch also has a panic button, which will send a text to the emergency contacts.","The Caref did well in our battery test, lasting over 57 hours, easily the best time of any tracker with voice-to-voice. It managed such an excellent score because it has a smart feature designed to preserve battery life. When the watch is not moving, it goes into sleep mode in order to save battery. When the watch begins moving again, it resumes its tracking.","If the Caref GPS Phone Watch has a flaw, it&#39;s that the design is not as polished as some of its competitors. For example, the glass screen on the face of the watch is fragile, so Caref recommends placing an adhesive sticker on the watch face in order to protect it. Caref includes two stickers, but you have to apply them yourself. Another small issue is that the battery life indicator did not indicate an accurate level in our tests, staying at around 15 percent for half of the GPS watch&#39;s life.","The GPS watch costs less than $10 to use per month, and there is no contract. Caref ships the watch with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"8c8d7c73-9ada-4d65-81fb-304d321c1a8d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"be26e763-53d6-4ebe-aed4-9efe54eefbc7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Caref GPS Phone Watch is one of the best values on the GPS tracker market because it has exceptional features and is affordable.
