You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Symphony SPM30 is not just an indoor <a href=\"/best-portable-evaporative-coolers\">portable evaporative air cooler</a>. Operating at a powerful 3,000 CFM (cubic feet per minute), this is a powerful unit that can lower indoor temperatures by up to 20 degrees and can also be used outdoors to cool your deck, patio, garage or even a small warehouse.","Encased in a galvanized steel cabinet, this portable swamp cooler bears an aesthetic design that more closely resembles a home appliance than a piece of furniture. Box-shaped in appearance, it stands 38.5 inches tall and is 27 inches wide, with a depth of 24.5 inches. At a total weight of 95 pounds, the SPM30 may not be the ideal choice if you’re looking for a cooler that you can transport frequently – but it is equipped with four heavy-duty casters, which enables easy repositioning on flat surfaces. The casters are also locking, which brings additional stability.","The SPM30 is equipped with a 3,000 CFM fan capable of cooling areas up to 1,000 square feet. A large 12 x 12-inch grate on its front face channels a powerful stream of air that can be aimed manually through a series of louvers. The unit is powered by a two-speed, 1/3-horsepower motor that uses more power than smaller portable evaporative cooling units, but its energy consumption remains significantly lower than traditional air conditioning.","Although the unit comes with no remote control and operates at only two speeds, it does include a number of features that may appeal to specific uses and environments. A built-in tool tray on the top of the cooler offers plenty of space for setting down tools or other equipment. The tray even includes two circular cup holders. In addition to a 7.5-gallon water tank that can be manually filled, the cooler also comes with a convenient hose connection that provides a constant water supply, allowing it to be run indefinitely without having to replenish the tank.","The Symphony SPM30 is suited for indoor or outdoor use. All that’s required to operate it is electrical power and water. While it consumes more power than smaller portable evaporative coolers, overall energy consumption is still approximately 10 times less than that of standard air conditioning. If you’re seeking a cooler with the ability to run for extended periods of time without the need for frequent attention, we suggest taking a look at the SPM30."]},"id":"b542fa4c-bf50-4b87-b47a-e83a64fb4854","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66096","url":"/symphony-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-09T13:33:02Z","datePublished":"2015-07-09T13:33:02Z","name":"Symphony SPM30","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-07-09T13:33:02Z","id":"69wiFUEdskaPZGotmH2MHC","meta":{"title":"Symphony SPM30 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read about the Symphony SPM30, a portable evaporative air cooler with a CFM rating of 3,000.
