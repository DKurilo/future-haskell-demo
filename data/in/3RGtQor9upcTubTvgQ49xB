The best Mac internet security programs can detect and remove Windows threats along with Mac viruses keeping you and your friends, family and coworkers safe from malware.","<strong>How do I clean viruses from my Mac?</strong>","We found the hardest part of manually removing viruses from Mac machines was tracking down the infected file because often it looked like a legitimate folder or program. There are a few websites that list common threats, where they are typically located and how to recognize them. But this can turn into a long, complicated task. Software, like <a href=\"/bitdefender-antivirus-for-mac-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac</a>, tracks down these threats for you, and will automatically delete them so you don’t have to deal with them at all. In fact, we found that Bitdefender was one of the best at being able to recognize the difference between the threat and a legitimate file while others had to ask us to double check them before permanently deleting them. And other programs left some of the threats alone because they were so well disguised as genuine folders.","Some antivirus software developers offer free virus scans on their websites, including <a href=\"/f-secure-anti-virus-for-mac-review\">F-Secure</a>. However, most of these simply tell you if your devices are infected and the names of these threats. A few will tell you where they are located, and the majority require you to still manually remove them. Overall, we highly recommend investing in an internet security program compatible with your Mac to help you, first prevent infection in the first place, and with locating and removing threats if they do sneak in.","<strong>How much does Mac internet security cost?</strong>","Mac Internet Security software costs on average between $60 and $90, with the best programs including multiple user licenses so you can protect between three and 10 devices at once. These solutions often come with mobile protection so both your mobile devices and your home computers and laptops are protected. Internet security software is a step up from basic Mac antivirus programs that cost about $50 for a single license and don’t include the same number of protection tools as Mac internet security software.","<strong>What is the best antivirus for Windows 10?</strong>","After months of testing antivirus software using live malware samples, we learned that Bitdefender is the best antivirus solution for both Mac and Windows computers. <a href=\"/bitdefender-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus Plus</a>, the Windows 10 version of the software, also comes with a VPN, file shredder and password manager. One of the best features of Bitdefender in both the Mac and Windows versions of the program is its secure delete. This function scrubs stopped and captured malware from your computer without leaving any trace of the threat behind. This prevents the malware from infecting your computer after it has been quarantined or even deleted.","Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2019 is also the best value for Windows antivirus software. It comes with more security tools that other antivirus program and with a minimum of five user licenses that let you secure several Windows computers at once for a decent price."]},"id":"2421c84c-8817-4b94-8ade-75b971de5f60","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_353","url":"/best-mac-internet-security-software","authors":[{"email":"nicole.johnston@futurenet.com","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T20:33:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T20:33:00Z","name":"Best Mac Internet Security Software of 2019","synopsis":"We spent three months testing the antivirus portion of Mac internet security suites and the extra features that each bundle offers to find the best.
