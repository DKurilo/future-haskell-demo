Although, the Inspiron One 20&#39;s design is not as sharp as other higher-end models, it still manages to retain a sophisticated touch and uncluttered look and feel.","This all-in-one desktop PC is ideal for watching movies, browsing the internet and doing work. However, if you intend to work on editing photos and other graphics, this PC isn&#39;t quite up to par.","With a 20-inch wide screen and display resolution of 1600x900 pixels, you can watch videos, but you shouldn&#39;t expect the screen to be as clear as the higher-end models in its class.","One plus of this home PC is the touchscreen. With the touchscreen you can do gestures such as swipe, pinch and more for a personalized experience. This also helps to cut down on time when navigating on the PC.","Another thing found lacking in this all-in-one desktop PC is connectivity. It doesn&#39;t have HDMI in and out port, Thunderbolt or USB 3.0 ports. This is problematic because it limits what you can do with the PC. For example, you can&#39;t prolong its life by using it as a monitor, to play games, or watch Blu-ray DVDs. It only comes with five USB 2.0 ports better suited for connecting peripherals such as your mouse and keyboard.","The mouse and keyboard are actually wired so you&#39;ll need to use two of the USB 2.0 ports for that purpose to start. These devices have a cheap plastic look and feel, but work well enough.","At roughly 15 pounds, this home PC is light enough to lift and maneuver around the house, which is a great bonus if you live in a cramped apartment or room.","If you need assistance you can reach technical support by email or phone found on Dell&#39;s website. And if you run into an urgent problem and need to speak to someone immediately there is a live chat option you can utilize. For added insurance the PC comes with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"0c4db071-2ffb-46eb-beb1-957af285d8c8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"739525eb-7b76-423c-8bdc-6dd205949e8d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Inspiron One 20 all-in-one PC is a budget-conscious option that manages to offer a wide variety of the features found in higher-end models but at a lower price point.
