As with most subwoofers, the sweet spot isn&#39;t close to the maximum output, but is the subwoofer&#39;s maximum volume at its best performance.

In other words, it&#39;s big enough to let your neighbors know when you&#39;ve pulled into the driveway.","The Pioneer TS-WX1210A is the only subwoofer I reviewed with a frequency response touching 20 Hz – the basement of human hearing. This is somewhat surprising, as I&#39;d expect more subwoofers to have lower frequency responses.
