However, it comes up short in certain areas, such as accuracy ratings and projection capabilities.","This self-leveling <a href=\"/best-laser-line-levels\">laser line level</a> uses an internal pendulum to make sure the tool produces a perfectly level or plumb line. Because of this, you can place the tool approximately four degrees out of level and the pendulum adjusts the difference. When you set up the level, it takes approximately five seconds to settle into position. If the level is placed outside the four-degree range, an LED at the top of the unit turns red and the laser flashes repeatedly, so you&#39;ll know it needs to be adjusted. You can lock the pendulum in place so you can project a line out of level when needed.","The laser line level has a working range of 30 feet with an accuracy rating of a quarter inch. This distance and accuracy is not the best out of the laser line levels we reviewed, but it is sufficient for most purposes. During our testing process, we found that this laser line level’s horizontal line is movable within a range of 110 degrees. It can project a line across an entire wall or two walls. This feature is especially useful when you want to hang pictures at the same height on two or more walls.","The HLCL01 requires two AA batteries, and they give you approximately 15 hours of continuous use. This ensures that you don&#39;t have to worry about it dying on you mid-project. The level comes with an adjustable clamp that you attach to the tool with standard quarter-inch tripod threading. If you have a normal camera tripod, you can mount it to that instead when called for.","As useful as this tool is, it lacks most of the mounting options we look for in this category. It does come with a clamp, and you can attach it to a tripod. But it’s missing a magnetic mount, as well as a suction-cup and adhesive mount. Any one of these would improve the versatility of this device."]},"id":"237fea71-6d17-403a-b03d-14181ae23773","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"57a95bb1-d06b-442c-ad4a-d6e1f0ad4807","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HAMMERHEAD HLCL01 is a great option when you are looking for a laser line level.
