We compared the online product pages for each of the kits in our lineup, read reviews and done extensive online research to determine the types of tools that are essential for any kit and which are more specialized. We found a variety of kits that would work for repairers of any skill level, including experienced jewelers.   ","<strong>How We Researched and Evaluated Watch Repair Kits</strong>","We did an extensive search and found watch repair kits that let you perform all the repairs your watch collection needs, ideally eliminating the need for taking them to a jeweler for repairs. We wanted to have a good selection of repair kits; some help you keep it simple and provide an affordable option with the essential tools to do basic repairs and keep watches performing at their peak. Other kits allow for more complex repair jobs. We included both types of kits in our lineup. We examined each kit carefully to determine which ones work best for beginners and which have tools for advanced watch repairers.  ","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying a Watch Repair Kit</strong>","Tools Included<br/>Generally the more tools in a kit the better, though a novice repair person may want to go for a simpler kit. Most watch repair tools include slotted and Phillips screwdrivers for removing small screws, tweezers to handle batteries and pick up parts, spring bars to attach watchbands and a link remover for fitting metal watchbands. Kits for performing more complex tasks will include all the basic tools along with a watch case opener, a watch hand remover, a head hammer, chain nose pliers and a loupe for seeing tiny objects up close. ","Usage<br/>Tools in watch repair kits can be used to fix watches and devices of all kinds with small parts. Small screwdrivers will help you remove battery covers and tighten screws on eyeglasses. Hobbyists can use them to dismantle a watch or other electronic device for cleaning and repair. You can use tweezers to remove and insert batteries or small, intricate pieces. Some kits include job-specific tools, such as a watch-hand remover to transfer watch hands without damaging them. A loupe provides a range of magnifications to see the tiny parts, and it frees up your hands to focus on watch repairs.","Additional Features<br/>Some watch repair kits come with a tool case, which is a nice way to keep tools organized. It also prevents them from getting lost and makes it easy to take them with you on the road. Hobbyists who have specialized workstations equipped with tool drawers may not be interested in a case, but most others will find them handy. If you are serious about watch restoration, look for durable steel tools as opposed to plastic ones. The more tools you have, the more precise you can be with your repairs, but a basic tool kit is sufficient for simple repairs. ","<strong><br/>More Guides for Do-It-Yourself Types:</strong>"]},"id":"ec8f411f-ff09-4ca1-9154-d0b1f89e7d8b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-die-cutting-machines\">The Best Die Cutting Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-sewing-machines\">The Best Sewing Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-electric-hair-clippers\">The Best Hair Clippers</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"285adfa0-7490-4f47-ae0c-2e694d932455","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["id:1560"]},"id":"270277d9-2a8c-42b2-87cf-08f89b54f46c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_43","url":"/best-watch-repair-kits","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-05-07T14:31:00Z","datePublished":"2018-05-07T14:31:00Z","name":"Best Watch Repair Kits of 2018","synopsis":"Here are the best watch repair kits, ranging from basic kits with 13 pieces to advanced kits containing 30 pieces and precision tools.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best watch repair kits, ranging from basic kits with 13 pieces to advanced kits containing 30 pieces and precision tools.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-10-16T20:42:49Z","id":"BMuJdaXyVAyLji7mfqAcfA","meta":{"title":"Best Watch Repair Kit 2018 - Tools for Beginners, Professionals","description":"Here are the best watch repair kits, ranging from basic kits with 13 pieces to advanced kits containing 30 pieces and precision tools."},"products":[{"slug":"esslinger-deluxe","url":"/product/esslinger-deluxe","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","name":"Esslinger Deluxe","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","id":"EYF9y4H2Cm4RyvB7uWopih","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"stalwart","url":"/product/stalwart","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","name":"Stalwart","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","id":"qvf4eBWcQP67b6H4WmuYCj","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"utopia-deluxe","url":"/product/utopia-deluxe","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","name":"Utopia Deluxe","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","id":"D7fdKWFTd66oDjDF9834HB","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/6HDQsokV8tbp9U5fiCHZtd.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","mimeType":"","name":"HERO-Watch-Repair-Kits.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/D/M/734026/original/HERO-Watch-Repair-Kits.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","id":"6HDQsokV8tbp9U5fiCHZtd","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6HDQsokV8tbp9U5fiCHZtd.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Watch Repair Kits of 2018","description":"Here are the best watch repair kits, ranging from basic kits with 13 pieces to advanced kits containing 30 pieces and precision tools."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/6HDQsokV8tbp9U5fiCHZtd.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","mimeType":"","name":"HERO-Watch-Repair-Kits.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/D/M/734026/original/HERO-Watch-Repair-Kits.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","id":"6HDQsokV8tbp9U5fiCHZtd","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6HDQsokV8tbp9U5fiCHZtd.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Watch Repair Kits of 2018","description":"Here are the best watch repair kits, ranging from basic kits with 13 pieces to advanced kits containing 30 pieces and precision tools."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"tools","url":"/home-and-garden/tools","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","name":"Tools","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:14:41Z","id":"q2ziyv8AKNZWHZYNsTfF6L","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
