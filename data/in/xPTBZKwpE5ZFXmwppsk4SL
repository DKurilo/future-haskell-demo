This software offers an excellent selection of logging features so you can see the exact content your child is storing on his or her cell phone. There are only a few advanced features on this software, such as GPS monitoring and the ability to set alerts, but both of these features give you a closer look at what your child is doing."]},"id":"9b910f93-cbcb-4f25-ba08-5bb3bef4818a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Test Score"},"id":"fc4e3f37-4431-476a-a3d7-e9805d84a64a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ability to monitor your child’s location is a key feature that this cell phone parental control software provides. Everstealth displays all tracking information on a map so you can pinpoint the exact location of your child. Not only is the GPS location an ideal feature if you are worried about your child’s whereabouts, it also makes it easy to find lost or misplaced cell phones.","Everstealth also allows you to set keyword alerts that will notify you of any inappropriate word or phrase on your child’s phone. This alert system will pick up any inappropriate content from an email, text message, instant message or other form of written communication. You can even set alerts to let you know if your child has contact with a specific number through text messaging or phone calls.","Unfortunately, Everstealth lacks several features, which keeps it from being a top cell phone parental control software. This application lacks several privacy features, such as remote wipes or locks. You cannot block websites or specific numbers, and you cannot set daily time limits on the phone to eliminate concerns of your child texting in class or late at night.","One of the benefits of using Everstealth is the large selection of logging features this software offers. You can see all phone calls, text messages and emails sent to and from the device. The software also logs all photos and videos captured or sent to the phone. You can see a list of all the websites your child has viewed on the smartphone or any calendar events and memos stored on the phone.","Everstealth provides an online account that is fairly easy to use. Each of the features and logs are listed on a sidebar located on your online account. The sidebar houses all the features you may need, such as alerts, location and message information. You can also listen to recorded phone calls or view all the devices that you are currently monitoring. The sidebar is long and can be overwhelming when you first look through it. At the top of each webpage, you can specify a date range in order to see the activity that took place within that time frame. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find any settings or account management controls, and we had to search throughout the entire Everstealth account to find the controls we were looking for.","If any problems or concerns arise while you&#39;re using this software, you can communicate with a customer support representative via email, phone and live chat. The Everstealth website lists all contact information for customer service. The website also has a FAQs section, but it is small and provides very little information. We were also disappointed in the lack of any additional support features or manuals for help with this software."]},"id":"4d0570f6-3191-46cb-8996-5c16e0d89b75","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"29caf730-6903-4195-95ec-b2129b95e69e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Everstealth offers a large selection of logging features and a few advanced features such as GPS monitoring and keyword alerts.
