It feels cheaply made, and with its lack of features and dull performance all-around, the off-brand <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">waterproof camera</a> doesn’t justify its price. However, it does offer a few things that help it rise above the lowest-ranking products in our comparison. It captures high-definition video and has excellent digital zoom range, and it can be submerged in fairly deep water while still continuing to function. So, if you aren’t super concerned about having a camera that churns out high-definition photos, or that has all the bells and whistles, the ETTG BP88 is a decent option.","Compared to some of the other budget waterproof cameras we tested, the BP88 feels and looks sturdier. It has a nice rubberized grip around the top, bottom and sides which, paired with its slim and lightweight design, make it easy to grip even underwater. The buttons are rubberized and clearly labeled as well. It continues to work when submerged in up to 32 feet of water. Though the best overall <a href=\"/nikon-w300-review\">Nikon W300</a> works as deep as 100 feet underwater, 32 is still more than enough for any pool or river, as well as shallow areas of beaches or lakes. It can also withstand temperatures as low as 14 degrees Fahrenheit. The manufacturer claims it’s also shockproof but doesn’t state how high you can drop it from.","The BP88 has a single 2.7-inch TFT screen, which is large enough to easily review your photos or monitor a video while you’re shooting it. However, we wish that the camera’s software was easier to navigate. We didn’t find it to be very intuitive.","As far as the hardware goes, the ETTG BP88 has a 5-megapixel CMOS sensor with a fixed focal length of 8.15mm. It has a built-in image stabilizer as well as face and smile detection. Ten scene modes – like Underwater, Portrait and Sports – automatically optimize the camera to take the best possible shot in certain situations. This feature is handy for beginner photographers who aren’t yet familiar with calculating ISO, shutter speed and aperture settings. Advanced photographers can tinker with ISO settings on the BP88, which range from 100 to 400, as well as shutter speeds which range from 1/1000 to 1/12. The camera only has 8x digital zoom."]},"id":"4d346d36-aa40-479c-be3b-ba468b15e66e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70136","url":"/ettg-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-08-08T15:57:54Z","datePublished":"2018-08-08T15:57:54Z","name":"ETTG BP88","synopsis":"The ETTG BP88 provides low-resolution photos with middling quality.","review":{"rating":68,"verdict":"Despite its somewhat high price, the ETTG BP88 offers lackluster performance and is missing several features.","pros":["The camera can shoot high-resolution video."],"cons":["It doesn&#8217;t produce great photos and isn&#8217;t intuitive to use."]},"strapline":"The ETTG BP88 provides low-resolution photos with middling quality.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-08-10T00:00:00Z","id":"GznMrViQDKRmgMhYurTPXP","meta":{"title":"ETTG BP88 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
