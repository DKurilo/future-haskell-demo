In addition, these sleek black monocrystalline solar panels can generate a solar efficiency of 15.7 percent, which is a fairly healthy figure in the industry.","These Suntech panels offer a maximum power wattage of 250 watts, maximum power voltage of 30.8 volts and a maximum power current of 8.28 amps. There are 60 cells per module, with a covering of tempered glass and frame of anodized aluminum alloy. These solar panels are simple to maintain because they need no particular cleaning other than rainwater, but can be rinsed with water if any dirt, dust or leaves settle on them.","The Suntech STP255S-20/Wdb solar panels can withstand temperatures of 40 degrees below zero and up to 185 degrees F.","With these Suntech solar panels, you get a somewhat unorthodox warranty that is different from the standard guarantees on workmanship and power output, which generally are 10 years and 25 years, respectively.","Instead, you get a 10-year warranty on workmanship with these solar panels. As far as power output, Suntech’s warranty states it will cover the panels for five years ensuring 95 percent of their original power output, for 12 years at 90 percent power output and 18 years at 85 percent. Suntech’s warranty provides 25 years of coverage at 80 percent power output.","This Suntech solar panel model offers you relatively standard dimensions of 64.56 inches in length, 39.06 inches in width and 1.37 inches in depth. Each of these panels weighs 40 pounds, which is the lightest of the panels in our product lineup.","If you have questions, you can contact the company by phone or email. Unfortunately, there is no live chat option or company blog for more information, which is unfortunate since Suntech has been a force within the solar industry since its inception in 2001 and by now has established a worldwide presence in the solar market."]},"id":"db21236a-bac2-46b6-b5d9-583ae834b8bb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"68a6696f-59d1-4739-bd47-ef9336035e16","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Suntech Power is well known worldwide for its solar panel innovation.
