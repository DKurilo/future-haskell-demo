You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When it was released, the Galaxy S7 was the best <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> Samsung has ever made. It has been surpassed, of course, by the <a href=\"/samsung-galaxy-s8-review\">Galaxy S8</a>. It’s delightfully snappy, unabashedly sleek and boasts a superb camera. It’s water resistant and crafted from the finest materials. And after a noticeable absence from the Galaxy line, its microSD card slot has made a triumphant return. This truly is an amazing device.","That’s not much of a surprise, though. We’re talking about the new flagship smartphone from the biggest smartphone manufacturer in the world – of course it’s going to be amazing. It’s also an extremely expensive phone with great competitors like the <a href=\"/motorola-moto-x-pure-edition-review\">Moto X Pure</a> and <a href=\"/nexus-6p-review\">Nexus 6P</a> that cost hundreds less. We can’t help but ask, “Is it worth it?”","If you’re a Samsung fan? Without question. If you’re not, there’s just enough here to give your wallet a moment of pause. The Galaxy S7 deserves your full consideration, but thanks to a couple persistent issues, its price tag could be a little hard to swallow."]},"id":"863e09f6-b8c8-4d41-bb7b-b9043a4cc5dc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"05574ef9-d34c-4d4c-8b45-542fed3f70e8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/CN3uanvcVYciExk99aenjB.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/reviews/67694/samsung-galaxy-1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CN3uanvcVYciExk99aenjB.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"CN3uanvcVYciExk99aenjB","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CN3uanvcVYciExk99aenjB.jpg","alt":""},"id":"6b277e98-c040-4464-9234-156bb1c69ac0","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Refinement was the watchword of Samsung’s approach this time around, taking the success it met in the <a href=\"/samsung-galaxy-s6-review\">Galaxy S6</a> and building on it with attentive care. The Galaxy S7 is a little prouder than its predecessor, a little bolder and fuller. Samsung stayed away from plastic parts, doubling down on their metal-and-glass construction process. The phone’s rim is all soft metal and graceful curves, while its glass front and back lounge warmly in your fingers. Oddly, the lack of sharp edges is almost a downside; more than one person we handed the phone to thought it was made of plastic, thanks to its rounded, slippery feel.","It’s definitely glass, though; the ever-present smudges are a testament to that. Samsung’s insistence on sticking to a glass back sets the Galaxy line apart from its competition, but it attracts fingerprints with apparent desperation. We know we’re nitpicking, but it’s a constant eyesore on an otherwise gorgeous phone.","The S7’s camera bump isn’t as pronounced as last year’s model, though that has more to do with the phone’s increased thickness than anything else. Its fingerprint-scanning home button is likewise a bit flusher than in previous years.

Still, the S7’s setup process is full of bloatware requests.","Fortunately, it’s not all bad.

Each of its 12 million pixels has its own twin photo diodes built-in. This means every single pixel can be used to refocus the lens, which greatly cuts down on focus time. You can double-tap the home button to instantly wake the phone to camera mode, find your focus and take a picture, all within the span of about a second and a half.","It’s worth noting that while the quality of the pictures the S7 takes has improved, they’re not that much better than those taken by the S6.

The answer: Samsung wants to maintain backwards-compatibility with the Gear VR ecosystem.","A free Gear VR came bundled with every S7 preorder Samsung received, and the company hasn’t been shy about touting the headset whenever it can. Maintaining compatibility with it makes a lot of sense, but nonreversible plugs are showing their age.

Practically speaking, you can spill your drink on the phone, drop it in the sink, take it out in the rain or rescue it from a toilet without worry.
