It&#39;s an easy-to-install, powerful heater that can quickly warm a room while offering all the standard convenience features. Since it also comes in a variety of colors and designs, you are likely to find a style that fits your home.","This <a href=\"/best-electric-fireplaces\">electric fireplace</a> insert is designed to sit inside a fireplace&#39;s firebox. If it is simply placed on the ground it can be unsafe. It has a 4,600 Btu output and uses 1,400 watts to operate, so it can warm a 400-square-foot room in little time. Like the rest of the electric fireplaces we evaluated, this one can run flame effects without producing heat, so you can run it year-round without warming up the room.","When you want to raise the temperature, a thermostat lets you set a specific temperature for the log set to maintain. You can adjust the flame height and heat levels using the remote control. Physical buttons hidden on the right side of the log set allow you to easily change settings without constantly distracting from the fire.","You can choose between three different fire settings while the thermostat knob allows you to choose the heat level of the room. The electric fireplace log set is 20.5 inches wide, 8.66 inches deep, 12 inches tall and only weighs 13.64 pounds, which makes it one of the smallest and lightest units that we evaluated. Like many of the other fireplaces we researched, it has a 6-foot-long cord.","The unit projects fiery effects behind it, so you will get the most out of it inside a fireplace or near a wall so the flames can be seen. The grill and logs stay cool to the touch but the vent below can get relatively hot since it channels all of the heat away from the unit. Should the log set begin to overheat, the unit will shut off until it reaches a safe temperature. If you&#39;d like a different type of fireplace insert, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/akdy-review\">AKDY</a>.","The Duraflame DFI021ARU comes fully assembled. All you need to do is place it within your fireplace and you are good to go. The grill on this unit comes in black, bronze, brass or nickel, and you can choose between two different log types. DuraFlame backs this electric fireplace log set with a one-year warranty, which is standard for this type of device."]},"id":"8fe81abc-b948-48e0-be14-98b317b9ba26","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59371","url":"/duraflame-dfi020aru-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-18T15:50:33Z","datePublished":"2014-04-18T15:50:33Z","name":"Duraflame DFI021ARU","synopsis":"The DuraFlame DFI021ARU Log Set Heater is perfect for anyone with a preexisting fireplace, since it looks like a regular set of logs but uses electricity to create warmth.
