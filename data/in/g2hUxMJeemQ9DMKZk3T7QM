Though it’s not quite as powerful or feature-rich as the best projectors, it’s a great budget-friendly option for anyone who’s always on the go.","The M4 has a 50 lumen LED lamp, which means you’ll get decent picture in a dim or completely dark room, but you’ll struggle to see much in ambient or full lighting. It has a decent contrast ratio of 1,000:1 but it’s not nearly as powerful as other projectors in our comparison. You can also manually adjust the picture’s focus, although there is no keystone adjustment feature.","In our tests, the M4 fared well overall. It handles motion just fine but simply isn’t as bright or sharp as some, like the <a href=\"/sony-mp-cd1-review\">Sony MP-CD1</a>. Not all the displayed colors felt true, though warm colors suffered more than cool ones. Reds were the most frequently over-saturated and orange took on a strong yellowish hue during things like explosions.","Sound, however, was impressive for such a small device. The Apeman M4 has dual 1-watt stereo speakers located on either side of it, which made it stand out more than a few other projectors with 2-watt speakers. Its sound easily filled our audiovisual test room.","Its internal battery can play up to 90 minutes of content, which is enough to view plenty of YouTube videos, look through photos or even watch a short movie. You can easily plug it into a wall socket or portable power bank. It charges quickly which, along with its small size, makes it great for travelling.","The device measures 3.9 x 3.9 x 0.85 inches and weighs just over a pound, making it easy to store or move around. One thing omitted from this package, unlike nearly all of the other projectors we tested, is a remote control. Remotes allow you to sift through videos or adjust certain settings without having to get up from your seat, but with the M4 you’ll want to stay close so you can do so manually."]},"id":"aa4d3c5c-9b85-4d3e-8b6d-5efe36100815","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70095","url":"/apeman-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-07-09T18:01:44Z","datePublished":"2018-07-09T18:01:44Z","name":"Apeman M4","synopsis":"Whether you’re a travelling salesperson or you just like entertainment while you’re camping, the Apeman M4 is a good option, thanks to its quality functionality and durable thin design.","review":{"rating":83,"verdict":"The Apeman M4 handles pictures and especially audio quite well for such a small and inexpensive projector.","pros":["It&#8217;s the most affordable projector in our comparison."],"cons":["It has limited connectivity options."]},"strapline":"Whether you’re a travelling salesperson or you just like entertainment while you’re camping, the Apeman M4 is a good option, thanks to its quality functionality and durable thin design.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-09T18:01:44Z","id":"g2hUxMJeemQ9DMKZk3T7QM","meta":{"title":"Apeman M4 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Apeman M4 handles pictures and especially audio quite well for such a small and inexpensive projector."},"products":[{"slug":"apeman-m4","url":"/product/apeman-m4","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:13Z","name":"Apeman M4","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:13Z","id":"CAexvB49aqvYNXiozDQyoV","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:14:13Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/8vdbmN3R4EAdX3AwnDQfJn.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:13Z","mimeType":"","name":"56f72d127d892250af4b98a1b7bc51f9.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/56f72d127d892250af4b98a1b7bc51f9.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:13Z","id":"8vdbmN3R4EAdX3AwnDQfJn","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vdbmN3R4EAdX3AwnDQfJn.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Apeman M4 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Apeman M4 handles pictures and especially audio quite well for such a small and inexpensive projector."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/8vdbmN3R4EAdX3AwnDQfJn.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:13Z","mimeType":"","name":"56f72d127d892250af4b98a1b7bc51f9.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/56f72d127d892250af4b98a1b7bc51f9.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:13Z","id":"8vdbmN3R4EAdX3AwnDQfJn","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vdbmN3R4EAdX3AwnDQfJn.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Apeman M4 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Apeman M4 handles pictures and especially audio quite well for such a small and inexpensive projector."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/tv/best-mini-projectors/apeman-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:13Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:13Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"tv","url":"/electronics/tv","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:14:13Z","name":"TV","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:14:13Z","id":"hetzCY2dg335aDLYkLr6cG","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
