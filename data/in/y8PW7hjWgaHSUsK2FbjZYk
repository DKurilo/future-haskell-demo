You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Arris SB8200 represents the future of <a href=\"/best-cable-modems\">cable modems</a>. This DOCSIS 3.1 modem is currently compatible with three of the largest internet providers in the U.S.: Comcast, Cox and Charter. Although, none of these providers send data via the new DOCSIS 3.1 standard at the moment, this modem is sure to improve speeds in your current DOCSIS 3.0 network until they make the new delivery standard available.","When internet providers start streaming through this new standard, modems will download content at speeds of up to 10 Gbps and upload at speeds of 2 Gbps. That is 10 times faster than the current DOCSIS 3.0 standard. These lightning-fast speeds rival those of the current fastest internet provider, Google Fiber.","The Arris SB8200 has two Gigabit Ethernet ports that offer twice the connectivity of any DOCSIS 3.0 modem and the only other DOCSIS 3.1 modem we reviewed, the <a href=\"/netgear-cm1000-review\">Netgear CM1000</a>. These two ports can be used to supply wired connectivity to your computer or gaming console, while also sending data to a wireless router simultaneously. The SB8200 is capable of theoretical maximum throughput of 2 Gbps to your home network.","This modem has 32 available downstream channels and eight available upstream channels. That is twice the channel bonding capacity of the high-speed modems we reviewed for this buying guide, like the <a href=\"/motorola-mb7420-review\">Motorola MB7420</a>. That means you can browse the web, stream movies and download large files faster and smoother than ever before.","Because of its multiple Ethernet ports and fast throughput, this is the best modem for gaming. Online gaming demands real-time and immediate responsiveness. Dedicating a Gigabit Ethernet port specifically to your gaming console or PC guarantees the modem delivers high-resolution graphics.","This future-proof modem costs around $200, which is more than twice as much as most high-speed DOCSIS 3.0 modems. Still, it is about $40 less than you would pay to rent a significantly slower modem from your ISP for two years, which is the warranty term for Arris modems. This is a good investment if you are interested in streaming Ultra HD video or virtual reality content when it becomes available. The front panel has four easy-to-read LED status icons:"]},"id":"b44792de-4667-4bcc-98e8-7ca75cab0233","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Power: </strong>Green LED indicates power is properly connected.","<strong>Receive:</strong> Green LED indicates high-speed connection using bonded DOCSIS 3.0 channels.
