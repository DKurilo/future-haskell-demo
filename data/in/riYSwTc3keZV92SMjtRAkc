You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","In a category such as <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater in a box</a>, there are few losers. The Yamaha Home Theater in a Box YHT-495 offers not only crisp, clear sound, but also excellent high-definition color processing. So, you can connect this system to your Blu-ray or DVD player and sit back and enjoy the show.","The Yamaha YHT-495 couples its surround-sound system with Blu-ray compatibly. The system doesn&#39;t come with an integrated Blu-ray player, or any other player for that matter. It&#39;s somewhat of a letdown to have to buy these components separately. Yamaha compensates for this somewhat by giving the YHT-495 a wide range of compatibility with third-party players.","To that end, the YHT-495 comes with a wide connectivity array. Among the options for connecting your media are HDMI, component, composite, coaxial (both digital and analog), headphone input and much more. The inclusion of an AM/FM tuner makes it a truly versatile machine.","One glaring omission on this system is internet streaming. Had Yamaha included this feature, it would have elevated this system from good to great. However, there is a way to stream music from the internet through the speakers of this machine. The YHT-495 includes iPhone and iPod compatibility. If you have a streaming music app, fire it up and connect it to the system. This is not a perfect solution, but it’s a solution nonetheless.","While this system excels in physical connections, it falls almost completely flat in the wireless department. While you can connect a Bluetooth device to the AV receiver, you can only place that device up to 33 feet away from the receiver before it loses the signal. Additionally, you cannot connect the AV receiver to your Wi-Fi network.","Out of the box, the YHT-495 gives you two front speakers, two satellite speakers, one center speaker, a subwoofer, a remote control and an AV receiver. You have to wire these speakers yourself, which is a pain. These days, wireless speakers are the coup de jour in the home-theater universe. Additionally, the speaker wire included is antiquated. We recommend going to the store and buying more modern speaker wire.","That being said, the surround-sound experience you receive with the YHT-495 is on par with the award winning products on our side-by-side comparison chart. Yamaha builds the YHT-495 around the 5.1 channel standard. Some other products can support up to 7.1 channels. However, the purposes that most people use this product for, 5.1 channels are perfectly adequate.","This system contains a compressed music enhancer. This enables the machine to restore digitally compressed formats such as MP3 files into their original format. This means that music and other sounds are heard the way the original composer or artist intended. Yamaha got this feature right."]},"id":"b27ec144-7366-4479-bec7-4494ba047f4b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"55086c3b-aa5e-43cc-a122-200b14f512c3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In the final analysis, there is nothing wrong with the Yamaha Home Theater in a Box YHT-495.
