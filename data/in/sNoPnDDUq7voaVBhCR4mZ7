The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-electric-lawn-mowers\"><em>Electric Lawnmowers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The WORX WG783, or Lil’ Mo, is a 31-pound electric mower with a 14-inch deck, making it a great option for smaller yards. It features a 24-volt, removable battery and an ergonomic handle. Of all the mowers in our review, the WG783 is one of the easiest to use.","This WORX electric mower has three-in-one cutting capabilities for bagging, mulching or discharging grass clippings. The discharge system of this mower has some issues. The mower discharges its clippings directly in your walking path. So when you are mowing, the clippings have a tendency to get all over your feet. A more desirable feature would be a discharge system that gets rid of clippings through the side of the mower rather than from the rear.","When you use the WG783’s bagging system, the mower&#39;s blade sweeps its clippings into a .85-bushel bag. The bag size is one of the smallest among the mower’s we reviewed, but it is to be expected considering the WORX mower’s size. Depending on your lawn’s size and the length of grass you are cutting, you could end up emptying the bag five to ten times when mowing a large yard.","The Lil’ Mo performs best when it is in mulching mode. When it mulches, the blade sweeps clipped grass into the mower’s housing where it is then cut again multiple times before returning to your lawn as mulch. Most consumers of the WG783 prefer this mode, because they can use it to contribute to their yard’s health. Additionally, it makes the chore of mowing much simpler. The only downside is the mower’s battery will not last as long in mulching mode as it does in the other two modes.","The 24-volt battery that powers the WG783 takes about seven hours to reach a full charge. When you use the mower in mulching mode, the battery has a life of about 30 minutes. In discharge and bagging mode, the battery can last nearly 45 minutes on one charge.","The WG783 does not feature a one-touch cut height adjustment system, which means it requires some effort to  raise and lower the mower’s blade. However, since this electric mower features a small size, adjusting its height is easy when compared to heavier mowers. To adjust its height, you simply adjust the lever next to each of the WG783’s wheels to your desired height.","The WG783 comes with a two-year warranty. If you have any questions about the WG783 or any of WORX other products, you can get the answer online thanks to the company’s live chat support option on their website. If you prefer to talk over the phone, a hotline is available as well. We would have liked to see an owner’s manual available online for this mower."]},"id":"444bcd6e-8efb-4325-b1b8-835e1fbf51f1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"41f3fa69-304f-4d64-98b5-1ce9fb04252b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The<strong> </strong>WORX WG783 is an impressive lawn mower that is great for people with small yards.
