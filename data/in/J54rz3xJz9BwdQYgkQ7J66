With the Philips Wake-Up Light, they&#39;ve combined both markets to make an <a href=\"/best-alarm-clocks\">alarm clock</a> that wakes you up primarily by light. The theory behind this and other light alarm clocks is that gradually increasing the light in your room, like a sunrise, will wake you up slowly and naturally. The result is you&#39;ll end up feeling better in the mornings since an alarm isn&#39;t jarring you awake.","This model has 20 brightness settings for the light. For your wake up alarm, you choose the highest level of brightness that will wake you up before you turn off the light. The light alarm will remember which level you left it. In the morning, 30 minutes before your alarm time, the light slowly increases toward the set level.","In case the light doesn&#39;t fully wake you up, an audio alarm will sound at your set alarm time. For the audio alarm, you can choose morning birds, beeping or an FM radio station. Like the light, the alarm is gradual; it slowly increases in volume over a minute and a half. Also like the light, the alarm uses the last volume setting you set. This alarm clock doesn’t have the option of dual alarms or weekday/weekend mode. If your schedule varies day to day, you&#39;ll have to remember to turn the alarm on and off.","The snooze button on this Philips unit is actually a small metal lever on the side. When you push the lever down, you get nine more minutes of sleep. The switch is easy to find since it&#39;s the only part to stick out. Since the alarm clock is also a light, you won&#39;t have to grope in the dark for the switch. When you&#39;re ready to get out of bed, you turn off the audio alarm using the same lever","Besides being an alarm clock, you can also use the Philips Wake-Up Light as an FM radio and a bedside lamp. The bulb is replaceable but should last for a while. However, this alarm clock radio doesn&#39;t have a battery backup option. You also have to set the clock time manually. If you live in an area with unreliable power, you&#39;ll want to consider a backup option.","Philips offers a full two-year warranty for this radio alarm clock, one of the longer warranty times for any unit in our lineup. If you need further support, you can find troubleshooting information on the Philip&#39;s website or call the customer service number."]},"id":"c5a40056-7a8a-4628-a7e4-0840b4fc9f9a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"823ecbb3-1ef9-42e4-ba63-97c79de19d9c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Philips Wake-Up Light is a great alarm clock if you wake up before sunrise or prefer to wake up slowly to light instead of a jarring alarm.
