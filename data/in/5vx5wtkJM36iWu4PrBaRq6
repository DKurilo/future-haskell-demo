The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-vacuum-sealer-bags\">Vacuum Sealer Bags</a> here.</em>","With the Underbed Compactor Storage Box, you get the convenience of vacuum packing and the practicality of under-the-bed storage without having to purchase two separate items.","The Underbed Compactor Storage Box features a vacuum sealer bag built into an under-the-bed storage chest, so it is pricier than basic plastic vacuum seal bags. This item is made for just one purpose, long-term storage, but it does that particular job well. The Underbed Compactor storage box is not designed for vacuum packing clothing for travel, so its usefulness is limited to inside the home.","Using the Underbed Compactor Storage Box is easy. Simply fill it with your soft goods, such as seasonal clothing, bedding, pillows, linens and household decor, and then vacuum out the air using your home vacuum cleaner&#39;s hose attachment. An LED light on the front of the box lets you know when the bag is fully compressed, so there is no guesswork involved. The vacuum process reduces the total volume of your items by about 75 percent, maximizing room in your closet or storage space.","The hard sides of the storage box hold their shape while you fill it, during the vacuum process and once the items are in storage. The exterior box also protects the plastic vacuum sealer bag from accidental tears and punctures because it keeps the bag from directly touching anything. Because it is sized to fit under a standard bed, you don&#39;t have to figure out where to store the filled box. While this box is designed specifically for sliding under a bed, you can also put it on a wide shelf or stack multiple filled boxes in a closet, shed or storage space.","The lid on this storage box is hinged for easy access, but it isn&#39;t sturdy. The box has a sewn handle that makes pulling it out from under the bed easy. The attractive striped pattern on the box hides away unsightly packed items and keeps your room or storage area looking organized and tidy. However, because the sides are opaque, you cannot see what is in the box. A small identification card holder on the front gives you room to write a list of contents, but this is the only way to tell what is inside without opening the box.","When it comes to long-term or seasonal storage, this Underbed Compactor Storage Box is a convenient and reliable option. It isn&#39;t as versatile as other vacuum sealer bags, but it excels for in-home soft goods storage."]},"id":"1816ce66-bb26-47fc-b5bc-92fbc957c16d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62418","url":"/underbed-compactor-storage-box-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-01-28T22:00:46Z","datePublished":"2015-01-28T22:00:46Z","name":"Underbed Compactor Storage Box","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
