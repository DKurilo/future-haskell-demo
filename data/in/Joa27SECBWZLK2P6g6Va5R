The only difference between the Wilson version and the weBoost version is the name and the color. Housed in a durable black aluminum casing now instead of a blue aluminum casing, the dual-band <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-boosters\">cell phone booster</a> can be installed under a seat or in your trunk. Similar to the <a href=\"/weboost-drive-3g-x-extreme-review\">weBoost Drive 3G-X</a>, it has a maximum strength amplifier and a 12-inch, high-gain antenna to boost 3G and 2G signals on your commute.","The best feature of the Drive 3G-M is the high-gain, omnidirectional 12-inch antenna. It has an average forward gain of 5.62 dBi, which means it can pick up signals nearly twice as far as cell phone boosters with the omnidirectional 4-inch, 2.62 dBi antennas. This makes it ideal for rural areas where there are few physical objects between you and the cell tower. The antenna mounts to the roof of your vehicle with a 3.5-inch magnet.","The dual-band, 50 dB amplifier features the highest gain allowed by law for a cell phone booster designed for vehicles. However, it only has a wireless range suitable for cars and trucks. At times, when the outside signal is very weak, the range is limited to about 18 inches from the inside antenna. However, most of the time, it easily boosts signals to fill a sedan or truck, providing boosted signals for you and your passengers.","The biggest downside of this cell signal booster is the lack of 4G compatibility. As the name suggests, it boosts 3G and 2G networks. The benefit of 4G is in the download speed and call quality. However, 4G doesn&#39;t have the coverage of 3G and 2G, which means that if you live in a rural area, you&#39;re more likely to only access 3G and 2G signals. 4G cell phone boosters like the <a href=\"/weboost-drive-4g-m-review\">weBoost Drive 4G-M</a> are best for fringe areas near cities where 4G is better established."]},"id":"ac8c8da8-b12a-48ae-93fd-4de36736fd99","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"92fed1bd-053d-4cd7-b1bd-712ce81c345a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The weBoost Drive 3G-M features a dual-band, 50 dB cell phone signal amplifier and a 12-inch high-gain antenna.
