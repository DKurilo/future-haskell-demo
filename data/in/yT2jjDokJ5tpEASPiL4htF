Please see our <a href=\"/best-cookbook-and-recipe-software\">current lineup of other great products</a> for other recommendations.</em>","Yum’s most attractive feature is its simple user interface, which makes its quality help and support options almost unnecessary. Intuitive usage is a must when it comes to organizing data, and Yum certainly does not disappoint. Yum had some of the best drag and drop features of all the <a href=\"/best-cookbook-and-recipe-software\">Mac recipe programs</a> we reviewed, and creating a shopping list for a week’s worth of meals is as simple as holding down the Apple key and clicking each desired meal, then selecting “Add Ingredients of Selected Recipes to Shopping List.” Other items, such as non-food items, can be added manually by the user. The shopping list is even organized by category. The only downfall to the shopping list tool is that users cannot create multiple lists.","Another important ease-of-use feature is Yum’s large print view mode for use while making a recipe. The print is large enough to be read from across a kitchen, and users can move between steps with the push of a button. This large print can be an inconvenience if the user’s laptop is within easy view, however, so users should consider this if the cooking view is a major necessity when purchasing Mac recipe software.","Unfortunately, Yum does not offer any meal planning tools. This may not be a deal-breaker for all users; amateur home cooks may simply want to document their recipes and make shopping lists digitally, rather than in hard copy form. But when other programs exist that cost about the same and offer this feature — not to mention many others that increase the convenience of the software — it does not quite seem worth the extra money for the conveniences Yum does offer.","As we said, recipes for the Yum database must be downloaded as a separate package. It is a free download, and the recipes strike a surprising balance between elegance and simplicity. A strange quirk about these recipes, however, is that all weight measurements of ingredients are in metric units (volume measurements are standard teaspoon/tablespoon/cup format). We assume that this is to provide increased accuracy; it is common to measure dry ingredients in grams rather than ounces for this reason. The only downfall is that many home cooks do not own the proper scales needed to measure out these quantities. The units can be changed, if the user takes the time to convert them manually, so the inconvenience does not have to be a permanent one.","The categorization options for these recipes are numerous and can be easily edited, even with the pre-loaded recipes. Users can even add their own categories to the already impressive list.","Yum was among the only programs we reviewed that required the Mac Leopard or Snow Leopard operating system, so users running on Tiger should consider a different piece of software."]},"id":"9b0d696b-cb8f-4b7d-80ec-ed956cac1af3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3f218329-2200-4bb2-8859-ac5c2c288478","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, <strong>Yum</strong> is a decent, simple program for users who want a basic recipe storage and shopping list creation program.
