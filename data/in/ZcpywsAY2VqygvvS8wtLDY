You might be wondering why we would include a single-function, black and white printer in our lineup. It&#39;s because what this printer can do, it does extremely well.","The Dell B1160w prints nicely defined black and white prints at 1200 x 1200 dpi. This black and white resolution quality runs with the top tier printers that we’ve reviewed. Perhaps the most impressive quality of this printer is its ability to print 21ppm. Again, this is among the fastest printing speeds that we have reviewed.","Although the Dell B1160w can’t print as many media sizes as some of the other printers we’ve reviewed, it can still print media sizes from 8.5 x 11 to 4 x 6-inch postcards, which is a decent variety.","The maintenance on this machine is minimal with it only having one black ink cartridge. You don’t have to go through the hassle of dealing with replacing multiple cartridges. This printer can also handle a heavy workload.  The monthly duty cycle on this machine is 10,000 pages, which means you can really put this printer to work without any worry of wear and tear.","This compact printer is one of the most lightweight printers at 7.49 pounds. This small printer also boasts a compact design at 13.03 x 8.46 x 7.01 inches (W x D x H) making it easy to fit into your home or small office.","The Dell B1160w offers wireless capabilities. As long as your computer has wireless capabilities, you can print from anywhere within your home or office. With the B1160w you can also print using your Android devices. The other B1160 model, though it is a little less pricey, does not have wireless capabilities.","When you purchase the Dell B1160w you get a one-year limited hardware warranty and a one-year advanced exchange service warranty. If you have any questions or concerns with your compact printer, you can always check Dell for downloadable drivers, user guides and FAQs. If those don’t immediately answer your questions you can contact dell via telephone, email or live chat."]},"id":"735fff75-8bce-42a2-a42e-37ea5eda344b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f508abef-8d85-45b7-89f6-c5511ed3389a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though this Dell printer is limited to black and white prints, the quality and speed of those prints are great.
