With everything included, there&#39;ll be no stress when you print for the first time. A long warranty and plenty of support options also help put you at ease.","Print objects can be as large as nearly 8 x 8 x 8 inches, which is pretty average for a top 3D printer. Printing speeds can reach 80 mm per second, and height layers are between 0.1 mm and 0.3mm for smooth, quality prints.","PLA is the primary recommended filament for the MBot Cube. ABS is supported, but you&#39;ll need to purchase a heated platform before you can use it. Magicfirm LLC does sell inexpensive filament cartridges, but you can also buy any universal or generic 1.75 mm cartridge for use with the MBot Cube. You can print with two print heads, which means multicolor objects are a possibility.","This medium-size printer weighs a little more than 26 pounds, about right for a machine made of wood and PVC. There is an LCD screen, which is a nice addition. <br/>This home 3D printer includes a USB cable and an SD card, which provides you with more options for transferring your files from the computer to the printer. However, the MBot Cube does not offer connection through Wi-Fi or a flash drive.","There are many new improvements to Magicfirm&#39;s website. You will find email and phone support, FAQs, a blog, tutorials and a manual for the MBot Cube. There is also a full one-year warranty on the MBot Cube, which is much longer than the typical 90 days offered by many other competitors.","The Cube includes a power supply, a USB cable and the software you need to get started printing. Additionally you will receive maintenance tools for cleaning up your 3D prints, a starter roll of filament and an SD card."]},"id":"dd18333c-f789-452c-b1e5-742835af0f5b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c08b7f27-2f81-4e9d-8b33-e95f9e9f592e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The MBot Cube 3D printer is capable of printing in more than one color at a time and has a lead time of just one week.
