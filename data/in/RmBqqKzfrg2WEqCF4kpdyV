The company makes a variety of <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">flip down DVD players</a>. The monitors range in sizes from 9 to 15.6 inches, so you can choose one that fits your vehicle. Nearly all of its overhead DVD players offer the same features, including HDMI and USB inputs, built-in infrared transmitters, and remote controls.","These roof-mounted DVD players from Xtrons all include built-in dome lights, so when you replace your vehicle&#39;s ceiling light, you don&#39;t have to live without illumination in the back of your SUV or minivan. They come in various colors, such as black, beige and gray, so you can choose the console that best fits the interior of your vehicle.","The car roof DVD players from Xtrons that include an HDMI port let you connect your phone, gaming console or other media device so you can play games, share videos, watch movies in a format other than DVD or even stream movies from an online service if you have an internet connection. Additionally, each Xtrons flip down DVD player includes a disc with hundreds of games, so you can do more than watch movies on a long road trip.","The built-in infrared transmitter on these overhead DVD players lets passengers in the back seat watch movies or play games while wearing wireless headphones. This keeps the cabin quiet for those who aren&#39;t watching or playing. Alternatively, you can connect the in-car DVD player to your vehicle&#39;s stereo system with the built-in FM transmitter so everyone in the car can watch and hear the movie. Most of the units include built-in speakers, so you can just pop a DVD in and play without having to mess with wireless headphones or the FM transmitter.","All of the Xtrons overhead DVD players include a remote control, which makes it easy for any passenger in the rear seats to control the system. There are more inputs and outputs on these DVD players, such as A/V, auxiliary, USB and SD card ports, so you can connect a variety of devices.","You get a lot of entertainment options with an Xtrons flip down DVD player â€“ not just watching DVDs, but also listening to music, playing video games and sharing videos from your other media devices. These overhead DVD players also come in a variety of monitor sizes and colors."]},"id":"a6689044-0a7a-415a-83da-9b8ae52b5c1a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68355","url":"/xtrons-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-09T15:47:57Z","datePublished":"2016-09-09T15:47:57Z","name":"Xtrons","synopsis":"In the world of in-car entertainment, Xtrons is a leading manufacturer.
