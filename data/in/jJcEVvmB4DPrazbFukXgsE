Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When choosing an <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">HD camcorder</a>, you&#39;ll want to consider the video quality, the additional features, the design and the manufacturer&#39;s customer support. The Canon HF M52 rates near the top in all these categories.","This HD video camera gives you top-notch video quality. It also has user-friendly features, including built-in Wi-Fi for easy file sharing. Combine that with the sleek, lightweight design and excellent customer service, it’s easy to see why this high definition camcorder ranks high on our list.","The Canon HF M52 will record your video in 1080p, considered full HD. This full HD camcorder will also capture video at 60 frames per second (FPS). A higher FPS number means the camcorder will capture more frames in a second, giving you clear and crisp video.","The optical zoom on this Canon camcorder is just average at 10x optical zoom. The HD camcorder also sports a 200x digital zoom. However, since the digital zoom is basically a digital crop of the image, much like using a video editing program to magnify your video, the further you digitally zoom in, the more the image quality suffers. You&#39;d do well to stick to using the optical zoom whenever possible.","Where this camcorder really excels is how well it performs in low light. The lux rating is a measurement of how much  light is needed for the camcorder to capture video. The Canon has a low lux rating of 0.1, which is the lowest lux rating of all the camcorders we’ve reviewed. This means you&#39;ll be able to record video in relatively low-light conditions with the Cannon Vixia HF M52.","One of the most impressive features that is included with this full HD camcorder is the built-in Wi-Fi. With the Wi-Fi-enabled camera and the Canon iMage Gateway, you can easily upload your videos to the web without having to connect it to your computer with a cable. Canon also offers a Canon Movie Uploader app for the iPhone or Android devices. This app allows you to transfer you video to your mobile device so you can instantly watch your home videos on your phone or tablet. You can even upload your video to Facebook or YouTube after transferring the video..","If you are on vacation and have to pack around a camcorder, the size and weight of the camcorder come into play. The design of the Canon HF M52 camcorder is durable, yet its light enough for packing around on long trips or for daily use."]},"id":"ac2be405-866b-4963-a24d-cf5d82efe648","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"42340644-6dd6-4d95-bb03-07250e273a40","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HF M52 is our favorite model of the Canon Vixia M series.
