You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Samsung RS2s are attractive <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">side-by-side refrigerators</a> with all the basics, including spillproof shelves, crisper bins, and water and ice dispensers. The Samsung RS25H5000SR is smaller than many of the products on our lineup, while also using more energy than nearly every model we reviewed. Although Samsung makes a solid product, these models are lacking many features that the best side-by-side refrigerators offer.","The Samsung RS25H5000SR is one of the smaller-capacity models, with only 24.52 cubic feet of interior space, while other models in this series have up to 26 cubic feet of space. The side-by-side fridge and freezer has 15.72 cubic feet dedicated to the refrigerator and 8.8 cubic feet for the freezer.","The four refrigerator shelves are tempered glass and spillproof, so any messes or leaks won&#39;t drip all the way down the refrigerator. Unfortunately, the shelves are not adjustable. There are two crisper drawers and five door bins, including a dairy compartment. These models include a door-ajar signal in case the door is accidentally left open, and if it does happen to be left open, you can use the quick-cool option to restore temperature.","The water and ice dispenser is located on the freezer door, uses a Samsung HAF-CIN filter and dispenses cubed or crushed ice. As mentioned above, the freezer has less interior space than many other models, and the icemaker is mounted above the shelving space rather than saving space by being mounted in the door. There are four shelves, one drawer and four door bins.","While this side-by-side refrigerator and freezer is Energy Star compliant, it uses more energy than most models we reviewed, despite being smaller. Its estimated yearly use is 695 kWh, averaging about $80 a year. However, other models in this series are more efficient, using closer to 540 kWh annually. This side-by-side is backed with a one-year warranty on parts and labor, and the sealed system is covered for a full five years.","Samsung&#39;s customer support is top notch. The website provides the user manual, a searchable knowledgebase and tutorials. If you can&#39;t find your answer, you can contact customer service by telephone, email form, or live or video chat."]},"id":"f851e7e1-d503-4765-af4e-33f1d78e3460","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"25e76d9d-8427-498c-99f1-55f2cea59b0a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung RS2 side-by-side refrigerators are solid products backed by standard warranties and Samsung&#39;s stellar customer service.
