You therefore don’t want to buy a wall mount without having complete faith that it can hold your TV well. We did the research and put in the hours to find wall mounts that combine reliability, security and a reasonable price so you know your TV is safe when you mount it.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We spent more than 80 hours evaluating dozens of TV wall mounts to find the ones best suited to fit your TV and your space. We pored over product description pages, user reviews and star ratings, mobility specifications and installation instructions and compared our findings to determine which products work best for different circumstances, especially tricky installations like corners or brick walls.","<strong>Choosing a Wall Mount</strong>","At first glance, it may seem like all wall mounts are the same, but they do have some important differences, including tilt range, TV size compatibility and weight capacity. We suggest picking out your TV before purchasing a wall mount to ensure they are a proper match, as some mounts are only compatible with TVs up to a certain size and weight. ","<strong>Cost</strong><br/>TV wall mounts can vary wildly by cost. Some cost as little as $20 while others can exceed hundreds of dollars. Since there is little difference between a mount that costs over $200 and one that costs around $20, our recommendations focus on models that had the best specifications at the most affordable prices.","<strong>Popularity</strong><br/>The best way to gauge whether a product like a TV wall mount lives up to its listed specifications is to read user reviews. As such, we read hundreds of user reviews and considered each mount’s popularity compared to similar models. If a TV wall mount is popular among users and has very few bad reviews, it’s a safe bet.","<strong>Weight &amp; Universal Mounting</strong><br/>Wall mounts vary in size to match a wide variety of TVs. Some only fit TVs between 20 and 32 inches, while others can fit models between 20 and 60 inches. We looked for mounts that fit the widest range of TV sizes.","We also looked for TV mounts with universal VESA Compliant brackets. These brackets can fit almost every type of TV on the market and range in size between 100 x 100 millimeters and 800 x 400 millimeters. Still, you should always make sure the brackets on the back of your TV fit within the specifications listed for the mount.","<strong>Mobility</strong><br/>We only considered the mobility specifications for mounts that were designed to move. We considered the maximum extension, pan, tilt and vertical movement. Having a TV stand that offers mobility allows you to get the viewing angle just right for your setup or adjust it whenever you need to.","Some mounts have an arm option, which extends the TV further out from the wall than a traditional mount would. This is a great solution if you need to mount the TV in a corner, or if you want to be able to access cords, devices, ports or anything you plan on keeping behind the TV.","<strong>Installation Tips</strong><br/>The most important thing to remember when installing a mount is that you have to find studs that can support the TV’s weight. Since you can’t see the studs in your wall, you need to use a stud finder.","TV wall mounts require either a single stud or a double stud. Typically, if the mount is rated to hold over 100 pounds, it’s going to require a double-stud installation. If this is the case, you need to determine whether your studs are separated by 16 or 24 inches. They are typically separated by 16 inches, but if you’re installing the mount in a corner, the studs are likely 24 inches apart. Many mounts come with a built-in level. If yours doesn’t, you should definitely use one to ensure your TV doesn’t hang like a crooked painting.","If you’re nervous about installing a TV wall mount, or if your flat-screen is too heavy to place on the mount by yourself, consider hiring a professional service to take care of it for you. Services like Handy let you set up an appointment for a technician to come over and install the mount. Depending on where you buy your mount, such as Best Buy, also offer similar services.","Even though choosing a TV wall mount may seem straightforward, it can actually have a great impact on your TV viewing experience and the feel of your living room. Large flat-screen TVs aren&#39;t cheap, and you don&#39;t want an inadequate TV mount to fail and drop your entertainment hub to the floor. Making sure your TV is secure and the mount is reliable is of the utmost importance.","<strong>Why UL Approval Is Good</strong>","Given how heavy many flat screen TVs are, it’s important to have a wall mount that is strong enough to support it. Buying a TV wall mount that has been UL certified gives you peace of mind that the product will literally hold up its end of the bargain.","A mount with UL approval means it has gone through additional third-party quality testing. This process is designed to ensure that each mount is capable of holding at least four times the amount of weight it advertises being able to support. So, if your TV weighs 30 pounds, UL approval means that the mount should be able to hold 120 pounds, if not more. Most mounts on the market today are capable of supporting weight ratings between approximately 135 and 175 pounds.","Be sure that you double check the weight of your particular TV model along with the maximum weight capacity of the TV mount, which should be listed right on the device, before making a purchase. Mounts that have undergone the UL certification process will have the UL mark either directly on their chassis or printed on a sticker on the chassis. As a general rule of thumb, most name-brand wall mounts have UL approval. If you’re looking to purchase a more budget-friendly wall mount, keep in mind that one of the reasons it has a lower price is that it may not have undergone the third-party UL testing process.","<em>Contributing Reviewers: Suzanne Humphries, Anna Burleson</em>"]},"id":"67a3880f-6ac8-4757-a7bc-d7bdf41b0963","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"67f759ce-1788-4a7c-a7f6-85006edad92d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sanus-Systems-Vmpl50A-B1-32-Inch-Visionmount/dp/B003WUBL0S/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Sanus Systems</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUVPK8/?&tag=ttr_tv_wall_mount-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|895[art|NA[pid|53608[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Mount-It MI-318B</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Large-Flat-Universal-Wall-Mount/dp/B001JJESRW/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">ProMounts UF-PRO310</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012S4APK/?&tag=ttr_tv_wall_mount-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|895[art|NA[pid|53611[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Cheetah Mounts</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WDSY058/?&tag=ttr_tv_wall_mount-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|895[art|NA[pid|69055[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Loctek R2</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M93YHO/?&tag=ttr_tv_wall_mount-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|895[art|NA[pid|69054[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Mount-It MI-305B</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0196FG9AE/?&tag=ttr_tv_wall_mount-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|895[art|NA[pid|69052[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">OmniMount PLAY40</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WYVBR0/?&tag=ttr_tv_wall_mount-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|895[art|NA[pid|69053[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">VideoSecu ML531BE</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3c700864-ee6a-4501-b256-b8bac748e6cb","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_895","url":"/best-tv-wall-mounts","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-09-02T17:32:24Z","datePublished":"2017-02-28T18:57:09Z","name":"Best TV Wall Mounts","synopsis":"We spent 80 hours researching the best wall mounts to hold your family’s TV safely and securely.","review":{},"strapline":"We spent 80 hours researching the best wall mounts to hold your family’s TV safely and securely.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-30T00:00:00Z","id":"x36p9GwgTWW4gPdFzVLLvn","meta":{"title":"Best TV Wall Mounts of 2019 -
