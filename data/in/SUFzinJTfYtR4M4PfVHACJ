If the photo you want to use is on your computer, you can open the media browser, which automatically finds photo files on your computer.","While these features are certainly remarkable, they are not vital for Mac drawing software. Fortunately, VectorDesigner has a great set of drawing functions. Like many of its peers, this application lacks a real brush tool, though it has freehand drawing and Bézier curves, referred to as Smooth Path and Path, respectively. The Bézier curves have the added bonus of a kind of preview; you see where your curve will land before you finish drawing it.","The Edit Path button functions as the white arrow tool, allowing you to adjust individual vertices on lines and shapes. The cookie-cutter shapes included are limited to rectangle, rounded rectangle, oval, polygon and star, but they have an added feature. You can easily adjust the number and angle of the corners for stars and polygons with a slider tool, whereas in other Mac drawing applications you would have to type a number while drawing the shape.","You can fill shapes and outlines with textures, patterns and gradients to add visual texture. For further dimension, you can adjust the opacity of an object or a group of objects with a simple slider tool, found in this Mac drawing software’s inspector panel. Also in the inspector panel are tools to adjust the aforementioned fills, line stroke widths, sizing and rotation, colors, drop shadows and more. The layers, filters, grid and grid snap-to, document setup and color profiles (RGB, CMYK or gray) are also found in the inspector.","Text effects in this Mac drawing software include bold, italic and underline, as well as adjustable kerning and ligature. You can put text inside of a shape or along a curved or straight line, but you have to add the text as such; you can’t create text and later add it to a line.","VectorDesigner is not lacking in organizational tools and functions. The grid options are incredibly customizable; you can even change the spacing between the grid lines. And the smart guides are very helpful – they point out when your objects are aligned in various ways. The layers can be turned off, or made invisible, while you work so that you can focus on just the areas you’re editing.","The templates are really just a variety of available page sizes, rather than pre-designed layouts. But being able to choose your page size is a nice feature, as most Mac drawing applications force you to rely on rulers to determine page size on an over-sized canvas. You can, however, save a document as a template, so you don’t have to re-create a commonly used layout every time you want to use it.","VectorDesigner has a number of other great features. The filters, for example, are truly outstanding. This Mac drawing application has 13 filter categories with more than 100 different filters, producing almost any effect that comes to mind. Boolean operations are easy to access, with a dropdown menu button in the toolbar. You can also group objects within a layer so they all move together instead of as separate objects."]},"id":"644cca0e-a9aa-440d-b8d5-604ebd860342","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Usability"},"id":"6549c8de-35e7-4491-b608-90222419515a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/MaVwuPo5KMSUtkkLGvmgJ3.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"VectorDesigner can open and write to almost every file format on our list.
