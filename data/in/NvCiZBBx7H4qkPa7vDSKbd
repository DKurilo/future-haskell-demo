This <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-portable-solar-power-systems\">solar panel kit</a> provides power from multiple sources. You have the option of plugging in through two USB ports or one 12-volt DC socket. A full day&#39;s charge can be stored in the portable solar generator and recharge multiple small devices or power a laptop for two to four hours depending on how much power you need. While it’s probably a bit too heavy to carry around on a hike, it’s a good power source for your basecamp.","The design of the case is user-friendly. It comes in a bright yellow toolbox with a strong handle and a metal latch. It’s a little over a foot long and about 10 inches wide. Once unlatched, the solar panel releases at a 45-degree angle and sits on the lid so you can set it in the sun to begin storing power. One full day of sun will power a 40-watt device for around 2.6 hours.","The primary function of this portable solar power system is day-to-day use when sunlight is available. You shouldn’t expect it to offer continuous power 24/7 unless the load is small, such as an LED lamp. It’s a good option in locations that don’t offer grid power, like camping, traveling in an RV or working in a remote area.","It’s also a good unit to have in a storage closet at home. It takes up little space and can be a source of power in case of a natural disaster. The SunReady will provide power for basic lighting and even refrigeration when used with a small appliance like a mini-fridge. Many families rely on batteries during these critical times, but, after a day or two, you are left with non-renewable energy. This solar power system will help for extended outage periods.","This well-designed, manageable case won’t take up a lot of space in your home or RV. There aren’t a lot of complicated wires to worry about and you don’t have to worry about long assembly time. For the power it stores, it’s also quite light. While the SunReady SunCase is a bit heavy to carry in your backpack, it’s still a convenient solar power source for short trips."]},"id":"c587dd66-42cc-4b71-af41-b8424d54cdff","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61711","url":"/sunready-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-18T22:29:42Z","datePublished":"2014-12-18T22:29:42Z","name":"SunReady SunCase Mini Charger","synopsis":"The SunReady SunCase mini-charger has 16 watts of high-efficiency solar panels.
