We also reached out to experts in the field of vacuum cleaner design to get an idea of what matters for canister style units and why people like to use them. Director of Product Development at Miele Dirk Sappok said canisters are the preferred platform outside of the U.S. and continue to grow in popularity since they can be very versatile. Many canister designs allow you to adjust both the suction level and cleaning head settings so you can get a deep clean on many flooring types including tile, carpet and hardwood. They can also be great for getting into tight spots like under the bed, and up and down stairs. We looked for models that were good at all those tasks. ","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We have invested more than 300 hours since 2013 comparing canister vacuum cleaners, including many hours in our laboratory. We used various testing materials to simulate the things you may find on your flooring from time to time. We used kitty litter to get an idea of how quickly and easily each unit could clean coarse messes. We also used sawdust to simulate lighter materials and flour to replicate fine dust. We tested on low-pile and medium-pile carpeting, as well as hardwood flooring, to see how each unit would do on different surfaces.","We spent some more time in the lab examining how each vacuum cleaner moved around table legs and other obstacles to establish a maneuverability score. We scored each unit for portability based on how easy it was to carry. The weight and other design aspects matter for making a vacuum cleaner more portable. Finally, we performed basic maintenance on each unit – emptying the bag and cleaning the filters to see how intuitive that whole process is. We used a sound meter to gauge the sound levels on , as well.","<strong>How Much Does a Canister Vacuum Cleaner Cost?</strong>","There are lots of options for those that prefer the canister design for their vacuum cleaning, including some for as little as $50. We researched and tested the models that are most sought after which range in price from $150 to $550. Higher price is usually associated with more suction, but not in every case, especially once you get above $100. We only had two vacuum cleaners score perfectly on our cleaning tests and one cost just $150.","<strong>What are Key Features When Looking for a Canister Vacuum Cleaner?</strong><br/><br/>Bagged vs Bagless<br/>The first thing to consider is your preference between bagged and bagless models. Bagless units are generally more convenient and cheaper for maintenance because you don&#39;t have to continually buy bags. On the other hand, bagged models are generally better for allergy sufferers because they contain debris better and are less likely to create a dust cloud when it is time to empty.","Convenience<br/>One of the best things about canister vacuum cleaners is that they are good at cleaning stairwells. It’s worth knowing the weight of the machine you are considering if you are planning to take it to different spots around your home. It is also worth looking for an extra-long cord if you have a lot of area to cover. That way you don&#39;t have to look for an outlet so often. Finally, looking for a wide cleaning path because it can save you some time.","Design Extras<br/>Larger bags or dustbins are convenient because you will not have to empty or change the bag as often. It is also worth noting whether or not the unit you are considering has the tools you need – crevice, dusting brush, upholstery, etc.","<strong>Vacuuming Tips for Those With Allergies</strong><br/><br/>Vacuum cleaning has a tendency to kick up some dust, even while containing other dust. Lower-quality vacuum cleaners are even more likely to create a cloud, thanks to their lesser filters and unsealed hoses. Here are some tips for mitigating this problem for those who suffer from allergies:"]},"id":"5dc5cbde-3b82-483b-a591-8e092bc05e02","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Bagged Is Better – There are arguments to be made for and against getting a vacuum cleaner with a bag, but if someone in your household has allergies, the answer is simple: buy bagged. The good ones do a better job of containing dust both while you vacuum and when you empty them.","HEPA Can Help – Vacuums with High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters meet Department of Energy standards for containing small particles and trapping 99.99 percent of dust. Look for true HEPA filters because some vacuums just have HEPA-like filters.","Empty Now – If dust particles have nowhere to go, they can find their way back into your air.
