You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information</em>.","The Sharp Aquos HD TV does not have enough features to match up with the best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TVs</a>, but it has a beautiful display and costs less than the top TVs. It&#39;s a little higher quality than standard entry-level TVs and sports a sleek design. This TV is a great balance of value and features.","Sharp is one of the best manufacturers of LED TV displays. This TV features a full HD 1080p picture. It can’t upscale to ultra high definition like some other Sharp TVs, and the display isn&#39;t as brilliant as the best LED HDTVs. However, the picture is surprisingly clean for an entry-level unit.","Most of the top LED TVs offer wireless internet connectivity. The Sharp Aquos does not have Wi-Fi capability, but it includes a Roku Streaming Stick, which you can use to stream your favorite shows. The Streaming Stick takes up one of the three HDMI ports on the TV, leaving you with only two. The best LED TVs give you four HDMI ports. The top-line LED TVs also include full web browsers and certain apps that Roku does not offer. However, many entry-level TVs don’t have an internet option, so this Sharp TV has a small leg up on some of the competition.","Sharp is one of the most renowned LED TV companies in the world. This company’s reputation has been built on quality products, affordable pricing and favorable customer reviews. If you have any questions about the Sharp Aquos HQ, you can contact Sharp customer support through email or a toll-free number. Somewhat inconvenient, Sharp’s website does not however, feature a live chat option."]},"id":"44538477-15f6-4732-9e82-c989ab73d658","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"97b4116d-793f-4d01-8a47-f2b789563f07","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you want a new LED TV but don’t want to pay a high prices for the newest features, an entry-level TV like the Sharp Aquos HD is a great option.
