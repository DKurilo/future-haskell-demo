You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","One of Samsung’s newest <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">Blu-ray player</a> series is the BD-H series. The Samsung BD-H6500 is the next evolution of the BD-E6500 series. Many Blu-ray players share similar features, so missing one or two features will obviously knock this player down a couple notches when compared to the best Blu-ray players on the market; however, the Samsung BD-H6500 is still one of better choices you can make in Blu-ray players.","This Blu-ray player has the beautiful ergonomic design you would expect from a Samsung product. It is sleek and slender, but it also provides a lot of substance with its features. This Blu-ray player sports a built-in Wi-Fi function. This feature allows you to connect your Blu-ray player to your home network and access features like BD-Live and a bevy of online apps. The Samsung Smart Hub, featured in most Samsung home entertainment products, gives you access to powerful video streaming apps like Netflix or HuluPlus as well as other popular apps like YouTube or Facebook, all with the Samsung BD-H6500. This player instantly turns any TV into a smart TV.","It also takes lower-quality video from older DVDs and upscales the video to either full 1080p high definition or, if you have a 4K TV, it can upscale the resolution to ultra HD. So video from older DVDs can now reach the highest video quality for pristine video viewing.","This Samsung Blu-ray player is a DLNA certified product. You can connect the H6500 with your home network and share and stream media with other DLNA-certified computers and smartphones. This tool allows you to play media content from and to your Blu-ray player from other rooms in your household. With the built-in WiFi and the SHAPE Multi-room system from Samsung, your media content can be shared without cords running throughout your home.","Interestingly, the E6500 featured two HDMI inputs to receive high-definition data from other digital interfaces. However, this version only has one input and one output. Most Blu-ray players only have one HDMI input so it isn’t a deal-breaker, but it does make us wonder why Samsung made the change to this updated version of its Blu-ray player. We will forgive it, though, as that is a small change that may go unnoticed. Meanwhile, this player now converts video from 2D to 3D. Although this is a feature that only 3D enthusiasts will use regularly, it does show that Samsung is committed to making this product compete more closely with the best Blu-ray players on the market."]},"id":"523825c5-e024-4a06-a244-b8c68f5f9b39","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7739c457-f07c-48ca-8884-515095e29168","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Samsung BD-H6500 may not be the highest-ranked product, but that doesn’t mean it is not a solid choice.
