For one thing, it has two firewalls: NAT and SPI. NAT stands for Network Address Translation. It changes the ports your computer employs for internet communication and hides your computer from public view. SPI is Stateful Packet Inspection, which checks to see whether inbound packets are addressed to your computer. SPI protects you from hacks that are general broadcasts experimenting to see who will respond. Any computer that responds to a general broadcast automatically reveals how the hacker can reach it.","<strong>Ease of Use</strong><br/>Features that make the Netgear N300 easy to use include Universal Plug and Play, and Wi-Fi Protected Setup. A web interface to control the settings allows for remote management.","<strong>Help and Support</strong><br/>Netgear guarantees its equipment for a year, and you can receive support on the telephone or by email."]},"id":"38656974-b4ac-4149-85fd-aef95e9c26ec","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d1152350-cc43-4cfe-9000-8d3988b4af42","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If an IEEE 802.11ac wireless router is out of your price range, the Netgear N300, a wireless n router, is a good way to go.
