The paper feeds through automatically, just like a printer, scanning one or both sides of each document. Sheet-fed scanners like the Plustek SmartOffice PS286 Plus are often used at the front desk or reception area of a business. This way, the insurance cards, legal documents, and other papers or certificates often needed to obtain services can be scanned right there on the desktop scanner as they are handed to your staff. Because of the limited space in this type of office setting, or if it’s being used in a home, it’s important that the scanner has a small footprint. The Plustek SmartOffice PS286 Plus is one of the smallest and lightest desktop scanners we reviewed.
