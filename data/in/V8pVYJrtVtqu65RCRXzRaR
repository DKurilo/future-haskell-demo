If you need to take the customer&#39;s card out of site in order to run the number, you are raising the ire of your customers.","Ways to improve this interaction can come from communication and improved use of technology. You should contact your merchant service provider and inquire about portable credit card processing devices. There are credit card readers that can be worn on a server&#39;s waist, so that the card can be swiped and returned at the tableside. If you prefer to keep a central card reader for multiple staff members, encouraging your staff to point out where the card reader is located will make a big difference in customer attitudes.

With some merchant services, this will cause the total amount of both transactions, including the voided transaction, to be held.

If you explain to the customer that they will see their available balance lowered temporarily, and that no money will actually be charged, then the error is resolved. This beats having the customer get home later, see a larger-than-expected amount pending payment and an irate phone call accusing your company of something shady.","Usually the last thing you will do as a business is run a credit card as a customer&#39;s payment.
