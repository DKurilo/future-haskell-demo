You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Baby Trend Flex-Loc hopes to take all the guess work out of installing your new car seat. This simple <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> includes flexible LATCH connectors, a reclining base and a no-thread adjustable harness. It comes with some interesting features and is compatible with several Baby Trend strollers. However, it uses an awkward carry handle, and the handle&#39;s stiff buttons make it harder to use than any other handle, especially since suggested usage requires that you regularly adjust the handle.","The Flex-Loc passes all federal crash test requirements, and its energy-absorbent foam protects against side impact. The seat will secure a child from 5 to 30 pounds or as tall as 30 inches. Unfortunately, the low weight limit means that you shouldn&#39;t get it for a premature child, as they are usually born under 5 pounds.","The car seat is compatible with several of Baby Trend&#39;s strollers, including the Envy and Encore travel systems. It has an easy no-thread adjustable harness, allowing you to change the position of the shoulder straps and head support with a single hand. The stay-in-car base has a four-position reclining system, and the level indicator helps you figure out which recline position is best for your child.","While the baby car seat has an adjustable carry handle, we found it to be far stiffer than many other car seats. We had to wrestle with the release buttons to get the handle to move. Since the user manual shows the handle in its storage position while driving, it&#39;s frustrating to get the carrier into the car and then have to wrestle with a handle for five minutes.","The Flex-Loc is supported by a short 180-day warranty, so your child will be in the seat long after the warranty expires. If you lose your user manual, you can download a replacement for free on the Baby Trend website. Customer service representatives are available by telephone and email, and we received a response to our questions quickly."]},"id":"d887863d-a482-456a-ae66-a8870a852559","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5caa763d-7ffd-4578-b1e4-6914e8e4cb79","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Baby Trend Flex-Loc is a simple baby car seat with easy LATCH connectors to remove the guesswork from installation.
