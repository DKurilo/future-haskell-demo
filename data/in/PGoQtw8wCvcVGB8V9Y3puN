It has a 50-degree field of view, which is standard for <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-trail-cameras\">game cameras</a>. Its flash range is 60 feet, which, while not comparable to the top trail cameras on the market, is still good for a camera at this price point. If you place the Range Ops in a good location, 60 feet should be sufficient to capture night images of the wildlife on your property.","The Range Ops takes photos with a resolution of 8 megapixels, standard for a midlevel game camera. The quality of the photos is above average, with plenty of detail for you to recognize deer that habitually walk your property. The Range Ops takes high-definition, 720p video, which is a pleasant surprise for a camera at this price point.","The camera&#39;s greatest strength is its detection circuit. It features a lightning-fast trigger speed of 0.67 seconds, making it one of the fastest wildlife cameras on the market. This means that even an animal running through the detection zone should end up mid-frame. In single-shot mode, the Range Ops has a recovery time of 2.1 seconds, the quickest of any camera we&#39;ve reviewed. The camera will take a picture and in 2.1 seconds be ready to sense movement again.","This game camera also has two multi-shot modes, Rapid-Fire and Multi-Shot. With Rapid-Fire, a movement triggers the camera to take 2 to 4 shots with only 0.3 seconds between each shot. Multi-Shot mode gives you the ability to take up to eight shots with three seconds between each shot. These two modes give you the ability to capture animals at the beginning, middle and end of their movements.","The Range Ops has a detection range of 50 feet and a detection angle of 50 degrees, resulting in a detection zone that, while not overly impressive, should be sufficient for most of your scouting needs."]},"id":"eecc065f-8c8e-4f85-b26c-c570ef2bb4cf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"edb83328-852d-4e50-9705-c772fc4521e1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although it&#39;s not a professional-level trail cam, the Browning Range Ops XR doesn&#39;t pretend to be.
