First, the meat and potatoes of LED TVs is picture quality. All the other factors are moot if you’re watching subpar video. The Samsung 7500 Series LED TV does very well in this regard. This TV also features the Smart Hub, voice interaction and a quad-core processor that makes the TV run lightning quick. It’s not hard to see why the 7500 Series is one of the best LED TVs out there.","Samsung reliably produces quality LED TVs every year. The Samsung 7500 Series is one of its best and it is that way because it’s packed with features. And when you consider how great the picture looks, it&#39;s obvious why Samsung has become the choice of so many consumers. The 7500 Series&#39; black level score is one of the best we reviewed. TVs that have rich black levels separate the darkest parts of the image from the brighter parts without blurring the images together, thus creating a beautiful contrast in the image so nothing is lost. Combined with a 240Hz refresh rate, most fast action scenes will be just as crisp as viewing a still image. Color accuracy is excellent as well, although some other TVs do a tad better. This TV also has a super slim bezel, so this TV will be a perfect complement to any room.","Samsung beats out the competition by loading TVs with features. This smart TV has built-in Wi-Fi for internet connectivity. Combine that with the Smart Hub that features apps like Netflix, YouTube and Hulu Plus, and you can stream videos, movies and TV shows without having to hook up a cable or satellite box. If you’re into watching 3D Blu-ray movies or 3D TV shows, the Samsung 7500 Series has one of the best 3D pictures on the market. This TV also sports four HDMI ports so you can connect all your high definition devices to the TV."]},"id":"06a858ba-694c-4c8c-a2bc-a6e1af696dd4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"45083b40-f379-4db2-8de0-bedeb73c775c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung 7500 Series TV is one of the crown jewels of the Samsung LED TV lineup.
