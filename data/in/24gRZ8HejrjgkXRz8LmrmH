You can choose from its three wireless security monitoring plans that offer 24/7 service and three equipment packages. You must pay for professional installation, but equipment comes with a lifetime warranty. If you are in the market for a solid <a href=\"/best-home-security-systems\">home security system</a>, AT&amp;T Digital Life is worth checking out.","The <a href=\"https://www.att.com/legal/terms.digitallifecustomeragreementsummary.html\">service contracts</a> for all of AT&amp;T Digital Life’s plans run for two years and renew on a month-to-month basis after that. If you want out before the agreement ends, you must pay $30 per month for the time remaining in your contract. This comes out to about 75 percent of the $39.99 AT&amp;T charges for its Smart Security plan. This is very reasonable compared to companies like Vivint that charge the full amount when you end service early. You can return your equipment up to 14 days after purchase to get out of the contract and avoid the early termination fee.","There is one drawback if you are a thrifty DIY type: You must pay to have the equipment professionally installed. The Smart Security plan&#39;s starting costs for equipment and installation tend to vary but are currently $349.99 as of June 2018, which is more expensive than any other home security company we looked at.","AT&amp;T Digital Life&#39;s basic plan is a good home security system, although it’s missing a few things other home security companies frequently offer. For example, its control panel does not include a two-way intercom to communicate with a company representative through it during an emergency. It also doesn’t include medical emergency alerts. However, the equipment comes with a lifetime warranty. AT&amp;T Digital Life sends alerts through text or email, and you can check what&#39;s happening at your house from a smartphone, laptop or tablet.","Unlike most home security companies we reviewed, such as <a href=\"/adt-review\">ADT</a> and <a href=\"/vivint-review\">Vivint</a>, you cannot reach AT&amp;T Digital Life customer support through email. However, you can get in touch over social media, live chat or phone. AT&amp;T has dedicated technical support profiles on social media, which is uncommon and very helpful. The company also has FAQs and tutorials on its website.","The Smart Security basic package includes a keypad, motion sensor, two recessed contact sensors, four surface contact sensors and an indoor siren, which not even some of the best home security companies provide. The motion sensors don’t detect moving objects that weigh less than 35 pounds, so your pet won’t trigger a false alarm. You can hide recessed contact sensors in places like doorjambs to detect when the door opens. The contact sensors can also detect pressure when a window opens. This system comes with two window decals and a yard sign.","AT&amp;T Digital Life offers two other plans with greater coverage, but you must pay more for equipment and the monthly service fee. You can customize the basic plan by purchasing other equipment, including a keychain remote, smoke sensor, carbon monoxide sensor, glass-break sensor and touchscreen control panel."]},"id":"eb987f08-5d4b-4c63-847b-2df743d28ecc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68171","url":"/att-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-04T13:01:24Z","datePublished":"2016-08-04T13:01:24Z","name":"AT&T Digital Life Smart Security","synopsis":"AT&T recently ventured into the home security business with its AT&T Digital Life program.","review":{"rating":78,"verdict":"AT&amp;T Digital Life sells a useful basic package designed to thwart intruders, and you can customize it with add-on equipment.","pros":["The equipment has a lifetime warranty."],"cons":["You must pay for professional equipment installation."]},"strapline":"AT&T recently ventured into the home security business with its AT&T Digital Life program.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-06-08T00:00:00Z","id":"24gRZ8HejrjgkXRz8LmrmH","meta":{"title":"AT&T Home Security System - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"AT&amp;T Digital Life has multiple home security equipment packages and monitoring plans to keep you safe.
