This lightweight remote control helicopter flies extremely well indoors and outdoors. Its single blade and back rotor allow for interesting and innovative flying that is perfect for those who are willing to sacrifice speed and balanced flying for stunts and tricks. There is no gyro stabilizer to add extra balance to the flight controls on this <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/954-best-cheap-drones.html\">RC helicopter</a>. It is also missing some advanced features such as a camera and a spotlight for night flying.","The Walkera Mini CP helicopter is a true stunt copter. It makes room for innovative flying, including stunts such as upside-down flying, figure eights and barrel rolls, which you can even perform indoors. Many remote control helicopters are too large to fly comfortably inside, but that&#39;s not the case with this mini RC helicopter.","It has one large blade and a small back rotor. The rear rotor does add some level of balance and speed, but these are not the areas of emphasis in its design. Instead, this remote control helicopter is best used at a small range and in calm conditions outside. Its small size makes it difficult to fly in the wind.","The remote control helicopter&#39;s outer shell is made from a hard polymer plastic. It&#39;s lightweight but also very strong and durable. It&#39;s important to have an RC helicopter made from strong materials because these trick helicopters often crash into walls, the ground, trees and other objects. Whether you&#39;re new to the hobby or you&#39;ve been flying RC helicopters your whole life, crashes are inevitable.","After charging the battery for about 30 minutes, you&#39;ll have about five to ten minutes of flight time. This is very similar to other remote control helicopters. The flight time may vary somewhat, depending on speed and other factors.","The basic remote has both horizontal and vertical controls. The Walkera Mini CP helicopter has true six-directional controls: up, down, right, left, backward and forward. The remote control helicopter takes it a step further with the trick controls as well. You will be able to utilize single-point hovering and even upside-down flying.","The Walkera Mini remote control helicopter&#39;s controls are a little more advanced than some similar helicopters. It may take some time to really master the controls, but even children can learn to fly this copter."]},"id":"0abf65c0-3e7e-4fc9-bc09-37cb5ef7f67d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3bb89444-b147-43b1-a307-47039a2493f2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Walkera Mini CP remote control helicopter has a traditional design and a lot of flying options.
