You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Audio Books Corner.com takes a slightly different approach to <a href=\"/best-audiobook-services\">audiobooks</a>—they don’t require a membership to enjoy great savings on your favorite audiobooks. This isn’t an audiobook rental service; they sell downloadable books.","You don’t have to have a paid membership to enjoy savings at Audio Books Corner. Each month they offer some audiobooks at a special price. Additionally, this service offers a “Completely FREE Audio Books” section. You can choose to download any or all of the books here free. The free books include samples of the BBC comedy archives and some self-improvement books.","You can browse the library of audiobooks by category so you can find an audiobook on a topic you enjoy. Or if you’re not sure where to start, check the list of New York Times Bestsellers. AudioBooksCorner.com also has a search function so you can narrow your results by title, category author, narrator, price and format.","In-depth publisher’s summaries, audio samples and user review’s help when choosing an audiobook. You can get an overview of the book and see what your peers think about the audiobook.","The site is pretty easy to navigate, and there is a step-by-step guide to how the site works right on the homepage. However, its Ease of Use score goes down a little because the site looks a little cluttered. Also, even though it allows you to download audiobooks rather than waiting for a CD to arrive at you home, the downloads are incompatible with certain devices.","Although Audio Books Corner doesn&#39;t have the ability to transfer directly to your iPod, because of format compatibility, they suggest burning your new audio book to CD  then uploading the CD to iTunes. This is an inconvenience, but not a completely immovable one.","Unfortunately, this site does not have nearly as large an inventory as some other sites on our lineup. For all the advantages of not being required to pay a monthly fee for the service, it might not even have the kind of books you want at all. There are no young adult books, or books on technology. If you have an expansive taste in literature, then you might want to go with an audiobook service with more options.","The site does have a great self-help section, and there are some popular classic plays on tape from writers such as Shakespeare. There is also a huge selection of mainstream fiction from authors like Stephen King, so if your tastes turn to genres like that, this site will be a good fit for you.","The Help &amp; Support services are wonderful in many ways. The FAQ page is comprehensive and has full, detailed answers rather than giving you a standard one-word sentence for each question. An email service is available, but one drawback is the lack of a telephone help line, even for business hours. The service also includes a user guide, which is essential for a site that performs downloads without any added software. The service is simple enough, thankfully, to the point that you will not need to do much studying to understand it."]},"id":"207cb1e1-a701-4186-903b-e01db9e5573c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e019c82d-9292-4cfd-a621-0177c9494183","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is a good service to haunt for audiobook deals.
