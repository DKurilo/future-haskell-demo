You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Toshiba is one of the most well-known technological brands in the world. That fact makes buying an <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">HD camcorder</a> from Toshiba feel safer. The Toshiba Camileo Z100 series features a 3D camcorder that also records video in full 1080p HD. The best part is that many of the camcorders in the Camileo line are much more budget friendly compared to those from other well-known manufacturers, and the Camileo Z100 is no exception.","The Toshiba Camileo Z100 does well in video quality, with two lenses that record full high-definition 1080p video each. However, the lackluster 30 frames per second (fps) does hurt the camcorder a little bit. The faster the frame rate, the more frames the camcorder captures and the clearer the picture will be. The zoom capabilities are limited because there is no optical zoom on this HD 3D camcorder. The max digital zoom for this camcorder is only 10x too, and that is in 2D mode. If you want to use the digital zoom in 3D mode, it will only zoom up to 4x. Limited zooming capabilities slightly hinder your ability to get proper shots sometimes.","3D shooting is the paramount feature for this device. We are disappointed that there is no integrated memory on this camcorder though. The battery life is fairly average, at 60 minutes of actual recording time. Obviously, this can change depending on which settings you use.","The biggest disappointment with the Camileo is the customer service. Toshiba offers phone and email support, as well as a FAQs section for assistance with common issues. The biggest problem with Toshiba&#39;s HD camcorder customer service is that it is lumped in with the rest of Toshiba&#39;s customer service. The company&#39;s contact page has a specific phone number for computers and projectors. Camcorders are lumped in under other consumer electronics on the television&#39;s phone number. The phone menu is the same way. You may be listening to the options waiting for the automated voice to say &#34;camcorders,&#34; when in actuality the option you need is &#34;other electronics,&#34; which can be a little confusing. We made a couple of phone calls for general inquiries and were redirected more than once by operators, and sometimes were not even directed to the correct personnel. Toshiba&#39;s camcorder customer support leaves a little to be desired."]},"id":"72e36cee-9fa8-4230-97a0-058186766423","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bd0af581-8595-4ac5-bf51-52388cec8970","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Toshiba is one of the most trusted brands in consumer electronics.
