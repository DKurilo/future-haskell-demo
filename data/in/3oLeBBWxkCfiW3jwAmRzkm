In addition to reverse mortgages, Home Point Financial offers a variety of financial services, including standard home mortgages and mortgage refinancing, which means it can offer you alternatives in case a reverse home mortgage is not the best loan solution for you. <a href=\"/liberty-reverse-mortgage-review\">Liberty Reverse Mortgage</a> and <a href=\"/finance-of-america-reverse-review\">Finance of America Reverse</a> only offer reverse mortgages.","Reverse mortgages are tightly regulated by the government and insured through the Federal Housing Administration, so you won&#39;t owe more than your house is worth when it needs to be paid back. Before receiving a reverse mortgage, however, you will need to attend a counseling session with an independent third-party counselor. Reverse mortgages are not the ideal solution for all people, because you still have to pay off the loan eventually, which happens when you either sell your home or your heirs must sell the home following your death. This is briefly addressed in the FAQs on the Home Point Financial website, but it’s wise to discuss these issues not only with an impartial financial counselor but with your family as well.","Home Point Financial&#39;s website offers information about its reverse mortgage offerings by state, so you can get the most accurate details for your area. While there is a FAQs section that explains how a reverse mortgage works, it offers no specifics about the interest rates or other associated costs. If you&#39;re interested in a reverse mortgage, you may need to contact this service directly to learn more. However, it is honest in saying that reverse mortgages cost more than traditional loans. ","The website offers a great many calculators, but none are geared toward reverse mortgages themselves. There is also place where customers can leave a testimonial, but the website does not post them.","Home Point Financial is a reverse mortgage lender that operates in 45 states. It provides home mortgages and other products in addition to reverse mortgages. It offers multiple calculators and gives details of reverse mortgage loan eligibilities and considerations by state. However, in order to get more detailed information, you need to contact the company by phone, email or online contact form."]},"id":"3eead401-730f-47b0-af9d-afbe707207c6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63924","url":"/home-point-financial-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sabrina-rojas-weiss","url":"/author/sabrina-rojas-weiss","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Sabrina Rojas Weiss","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"tVZv6ejiouijuHU3n7n49Y","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-02T22:39:42Z","datePublished":"2015-04-02T22:39:42Z","name":"Home Point Financial","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-04-02T22:39:42Z","id":"3oLeBBWxkCfiW3jwAmRzkm","meta":{"title":"Home Point Financial Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Home Point Financial offers reverse mortgages and other types of loans in 45 states.
