Most greeting card software, like <a href=\"/software/home/best-greeting-card-software/greeting-card-review/\">Greeting Card Factory</a>, is so easy to use and intuitive that you will be an expert card creator in no time.","One purpose of a greeting card is to mark life’s milestones, such as birthdays, baptisms and anniversaries. Most programs come with expressions of sympathy, congratulations and wishes for religious holidays. Top-quality greeting card makers also include templates for nontraditional topics such as congratulations for job promotions, sympathy for the loss of a pet, and encouragement for when someone is feeling down.","Once you start making greeting cards, you might also enjoy sending cards for no particular reason, so a good selection of &#34;thinking of you&#34; types of cards is important. You can certainly get creative with the design-your-own options to make customized greeting cards that could easily become cherished keepsakes for the recipients.","Many greeting card applications, such as <a href=\"/software/home/best-greeting-card-software/print-shop-review/\">The Print Shop</a>, let you do far more than just create a greeting card. You can create customized stationery with equally personalized envelopes, iron-on designs for aprons and T-shirts, calendars for yourself and others, and even all the paper goods for a party, including hats, favor bags, invitations, place cards and labels.","<strong>Important Features: Text &amp; Photo Editing Options</strong>","The best greeting card software gives you the ability to create any kind of card and offers design tools that make it easy to use. These tools can include templates, clip art, photographs, and different card themes and styles. For those times when you know what you are feeling but are at a loss for words, some greeting card software offers writing samples of what to say and even etiquette tips on how to tactfully word a card that marks a sensitive time, such as a condolence card.","After you have written what you want to say, you can have fun with the way it looks when you plunge into making your own creations with card design software. You can experiment with text editing tools that let you do things like put text on a curve, add drop shadows, change colors and fonts, and position the words exactly where you want them on your card.","You can let your imagination run freely with photos, since quality greeting card software usually comes with prepackaged photos that you can use, or you can import your own pictures and then edit them to perfection. With most applications, you can enlarge, reduce, crop and flip images. The more advanced software lets you eliminate flaws, add special effects, change the focus and adjust the tone of a photo.","<strong>What Else to Look For in Greeting Card Software</strong>","<strong>Sharing Options</strong><br/>After you have completed the process of creating a pretty, humorous, sentimental or whimsical greeting card, the next step is to share it. The best greeting card software offers numerous options to make this part go smoothly, including mail merge for mass send-outs, eCards, or paper printouts to send through the post office. There also are applications that permit you to upload your creations directly to Facebook or YouTube.","Some software lets you add your voice, music and other sounds to enhance your card with greetings of your own. For example, you can warble your own rendition of &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; to the recipient.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>Software support should be easy to locate and understand. You likely will want a user manual, FAQs, and email and phone contact information in case you ever run into difficulties and need answers about your software. It is also helpful if the manufacturer offers live chat for quick answers to questions, as well as tutorials to help you get started.","<strong>Printing</strong><br/>Printing your own cards at home can be a great way to save time and money, as you don’t have to wait for a custom card to ship to your home from an online graphic design service.
