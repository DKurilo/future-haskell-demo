Over the last 13 years, we’ve identified the most relevant and unique features for each service and made our recommendations based on our experiences while using the mobile and online interfaces like a typical customer. We also contact customer support teams and ask important questions about the feature tiers, pricing information and various technical aspects to make sure we recommend services with comprehensive and timely support.","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","To test the functionality and feature set for each service, we created an account and sent a few test faxes to see how long that process took and how easy it was to navigate the online interface. We also downloaded the accompanying mobile apps, when available, and used them to send faxes, receive notifications and make simple changes to the account settings. After we got a feel for the interface and unique features for each service, we contacted the customer support teams via live chat, email or phone and made note of exceptional and lackluster transactions in each service’s review. All the services that made the final cut have all the features you need to securely send a fax using the internet.","<strong>Important Features of Online Fax Services </strong>","Mobile App<br/>You can use an internet-connected mobile device to send faxes with all the services we reviewed. If you plan to primarily use a phone or tablet to send and receive faxes, we recommend choosing a provider with an accompanying mobile app. Using a web browser to access an online portal is much more frustrating than navigating an application built for a mobile platform.","Security and Encryption<br/>If you plan to send and receive sensitive information, like healthcare records, bank statements or other confidential personal information, make sure the service you choose specifically mentions HIPPA compliance and enhanced security measures like PGP and SSL encryption. Willfully sending personal medical information through unsecured channels could result in fines of up to $50,000.","Plan Flexibility<br/>Analog fax machines are becoming obsolete, because online fax services offer a more affordable and user-friendly platform. For fledgling small businesses, it’s hard to know how long and how frequently you need to use an online fax service, so plan flexibility is important. If you are unsure how frequently you need to use it, we recommend taking advantage of free trial periods, and once you find the service that fits your needs, starting with the lowest tier plan. Service providers are much more willing to upgrade than they are to downgrade a plan, and comprehensive tracking features make it easy to keep a close eye on usage.  ","<br/>"]},"id":"6f8a2899-10fd-48b8-8d85-205ec6f85384","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_383","url":"/best-online-fax-services","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-13T21:19:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-13T21:19:00Z","name":"Best Online Fax Services 2019","synopsis":"Looking for an alternative to a bulky and expensive physical fax machine?
