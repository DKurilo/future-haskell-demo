If you want to use the credit tool to its best advantage then pay the least amount of interest when you are forced to borrow money. Don’t be seduced by rewards programs that entice you to use credit more than absolutely necessary to achieve your educational and career goals.","With these cautions in mind, we sifted through many <a href=\"/best-student-credit-cards\">credit cards for students</a> to find the best and found a clear winner in the Discover® Student More Card. Yes it has a good rewards program, but more importantly it has a relatively low annual percentage rate (APR). So you don’t have to choose between rewards and low APR. You can get both with this college student credit card."]},"id":"9284dc85-7324-4904-b38e-b3ede7dd1f7f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"APR*"},"id":"f5857e61-4a7c-4e0f-9fb1-c013640105f8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["After a nine-month period during which you pay no interest for purchases, the APR begins. If you have not yet built an admirable credit history, your APR will be 18.99%. If you have managed credit well, your APR will be 12.99%. Both of these APRs are extremely competitive. If you get into the unfortunate situation where you need to advance cash from your credit card, it will cost you 24.99%. In other words, try to avoid cash advances. Discover offers a more generous grace period for repayment than required by law. The grace period is 23 days even though the law allows a minimum of 21 days from when the bank issues the billing statement. The way that grace periods work is worth some explanation. Even though the grace period is 23 days from the billing statement, it doesn’t mean that you will only pay one day’s worth of interest if you pay on the 24th day. If you miss the grace period, then the interest you owe extends back to the actual date of purchase."]},"id":"6658bd3b-cb2e-4a86-8bc4-2e33d7918110","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Fee &amp; Penalties"},"id":"5157c541-5bfd-4426-8860-c730cc1f0d18","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are willing to pay attention to the calendar, there are categories that rotate quarterly that have a 5% cash back bonus: gas and entertainment, restaurants and movies, grocery stores, gas and holiday shopping.

For example you can select from more than 100 designs to find the look you want for the physical card. New design requests are free. And by the way, the plastic in the card is biodegradable. Furthermore, the Discover website has helpful financial tools so you can track spending by month and category and plan a budget. You should also know that Discover has quite a few ways to secure your account and prevent you from becoming a fraud victim. For example you will get fraud alerts via phone, text or email.
