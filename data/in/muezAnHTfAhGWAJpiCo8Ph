We encrypted 63 files that totaled 128MB in under 30 seconds. This is longer than a couple of other programs, such as Folder Lock, which only took six seconds, but is still fast enough to score high in our tests.","During testing we noticed that the encrypted files keep their original file names, but there is an option to scramble them during the encryption process. This tacks on more than a minute to the encryption process, but is a unique feature that most programs don’t include. Deciphering files takes less than five seconds.","After the software installs, Kruptos 2’s website automatically opens and displays a start guide that helps you familiarize yourself with the program and get started. There are two ways to encrypt your files. The first is to find the saved file through the Kruptos 2 program. Once here you can click on the tool icons to lock the file. You can also send the encrypted file to your online storage or email it to someone. The second way to encrypt your files is to right click on the file saved on your desktop then select the tool you want to use from the displayed list. You don’t have to encrypt files because you also have the option to create self-extracting files, zip files or to securely shred them.","When you create a self-extracting (EXE) file, Kruptos bloats it so it’s larger than the original file size. This is important to know so you can be sure to check that you have enough space on your hard drive to hold the large EXE file before you create one. For a program that doesn’t increase file size while securing it, check out our review of <a href=\"/secure-it-review\">Secure IT</a>.","Like all the best encryption software, Kruptos 2 uses AES 256-bit key encryption. This is the secure key that the U.S. government, military and financial institutions use when working with sensitive and classified information. Kruptos 2 includes a password meter to ensure your codes are strong and difficult to crack in case someone gets ahold of your files. You can use the included password generator that will create a good password for you, based on the criteria you give the program, like how many characters and if it should include numbers and symbols. You do need to keep your passwords safe and somewhere you can find them. If you lose or forget your password, Kruptos 2 lets you create a new master password, but any files that were encrypted with your old password can’t be opened with your new one.","Kruptos is not as fast with its encryption as some other programs, and it makes self-extracting files larger. But it is easy to use and includes a file shredder and a password generator to help you create keys that are hard to break. Overall, this is a strong and efficient encryption program."]},"id":"164b626d-2d0b-4c8e-b342-d1a0dde46ccd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67600","url":"/kruptos-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-01-22T16:22:35Z","datePublished":"2016-01-22T16:22:35Z","name":"Kruptos 2 Professional","synopsis":"Kruptos 2 Professional data encryption software lets you choose to secure all your files with a single, master password, or create individual keys for each file.
