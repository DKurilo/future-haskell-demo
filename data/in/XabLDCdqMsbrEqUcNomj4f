Generally, all <a href=\"/money/small-business\">CRM</a> solutions have the same basic tools, client-account portals, interactive timelines and report generators. However, some advanced tools are more important depending on the industry of your company. For example, real estate agents would find sales pipeline tracking helpful as home sales make their way through the steps of bidding, underwriting and closing, while law firms would benefit from file-sharing and document-management features. Here are a few industry-specific customer relation management solutions and the benefits they provide.Â ","<br/><strong><br/>Rethink: Real Estate</strong><br/>Real estate is a special field that has rules and processes depending on whether or not you specialize in residential or commercial property. In addition to keeping track of important client information, real estate agencies have the task of juggling property wish lists, matching potential buyers with sellers, and following the funding and closing processes. Because there is a lot involved, with several steps and departments with a hand in the project, CRM for real estate agencies is a helpful tool. Rethink has automation tools that create action plans, report generators to help identify local and national real estate trends, and project-management tools to help you keep a close eye on your pipeline and sales cycles.","<strong>Team Support: Healthcare Organizations</strong><br/>The healthcare industry has patients that interact with several different people, such as doctors, nurses, insurance claim representatives and office staff, all needing access to each client&#39;s information. Additionally, because of the sensitivity of the information shared by the patient, laws, such as HIPPA, regulate how this information is collected, shared, stored and eventually destroyed. Though many industries can use it, Team Support customer management software is a CRM specifically designed for healthcare. The team-collaboration tools make it easy for each individual that interacts with a patient to access account information and medical history. Since Team Support is cloud-based, this means information stored within the CRM can be accessed from any web-enabled device. This means the doctor can use his or her tablet to record patient information while insurance claims representatives can access the same client information from their desktop for collecting payment.","<strong>Aderant: Law Firms</strong><br/>Law firms deal with many files encompassing a lot of cases and clients. With the amount of personal and time-sensitive information that needs to be kept safe and often moved quickly through the office, to other law firms, police, investigators and courts, legal-specific solutions are almost mandatory. CRM software for law firms is very helpful in keeping track of sensitive files of information and tracking various projects. Aderant has created a contact management solution especially for legal services. As it runs from within your Outlook and Microsoft Office applications, this solution makes it easy to create and attach important documents, email them to other departments or organizations, and track the progress of each individual case. Additionally, because this is a CRM specifically for law firms, additional security measures have been included to make sure sensitive information doesn&#39;t fall into the wrong hands.","<strong>NeonCRM: Nonprofit</strong><br/>Nonprofit organizations have their own unique way of doing business. This is because of their financial structure, including keeping track of donors, applying for grants and following the financial stream through each individual project, on top of the special tax designation given to nonprofits. NeonCRM is CRM software specifically for nonprofits that includes tools for capturing information from visitors that come to your website, following grant applications and recording program implementation. It also easily organizes contacts based on donors, memberships and volunteers.","Contact management software is meant to help the process of customer service. While any CRM solution could offer valuable tools, industry-specific programs give you the features you need for your individual company because they have been designed with those unique needs and procedures in mind."]},"id":"5f996108-86a4-4854-bd31-a7b266d0cbde","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8818","url":"/industry-specific-crm-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-06T18:23:43Z","datePublished":"2014-10-06T18:23:43Z","name":"Industry Specific CRM Software","synopsis":"Content management software is an important tool in organizing your client information and making it accessible to multiple employees and departments within your organization.","review":{},"strapline":"Content management software is an important tool in organizing your client information and making it accessible to multiple employees and departments within your organization.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-10-14T22:14:39Z","id":"XabLDCdqMsbrEqUcNomj4f","meta":{"title":"Industry Specific CRM Software","description":"Customer service is an important aspect of your business success and is predicated in part on your specific industry needs.
