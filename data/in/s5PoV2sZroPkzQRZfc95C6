With many of these <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">DVD/VCR combo</a> products, you can enjoy playback and recording capabilities, compatibility with many formats and numerous connectivity options.","Some of these Toshiba models feature 1080p upconversion. This technology is the mechanism by which the unit adapts the lower resolution picture contained on VHS tapes and DVDs to match the higher resolution achieved by advanced HD televisions.","If you remember a world without VHS, you likely have a great appreciation for how far humankind has come technologically. It also means you more than likely own several VHS movies, home videos and other content that simply can&#39;t be found on today&#39;s new media. The inclusion of a four-head VCR on these units enables you to watch your old VHS collection. These units also allow you to transfer the content contained on VHS tapes to DVDs.","These products are compatible with most recordable media formats. These formats include DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD+R. Most of these machines only allow for one disc to be stored in the machine at once, which is common for these products.","The connectivity array on the Toshiba DVD/VCR combo contains all the familiar outlets you&#39;ve seen on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray players in past decades. The three C&#39;s – coaxial, composite and component – are all there. The real star on the connectivity array is the HDMI jack that allows you to connect your DVD/VCR combo to a high-definition television. Some of these units also feature a digital tuner that enables you to receive digital over-the-air broadcast signals and route them to your television. For convenience, a remote is included with most of these products.","Unfortunately, on some of these products, there are a few features missing that we generally like to see on this type of technology. For example, you will not see on all these Toshiba products the ability to display subtitles, which is downer for customers who are hearing impaired. You may also not find multi-angle viewing and Dolby Digital Sound.","Overall, Toshiba&#39;s  DVD/VCR combo players have the basic features you need in this type of product, so they are a good choice among the limited options."]},"id":"cb45a3e3-9fb2-4f95-b961-bfd410e36ed5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53235","url":"/toshiba-dvd-recorder-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-07-05T20:02:22Z","datePublished":"2011-07-05T20:02:22Z","name":"Toshiba DVD Recorder DVR620","synopsis":"Toshiba provides only a small number of products that allow you to play your favorite VHS tapes so you don't have to transfer everything to Blu-ray or DVDs.","review":{"rating":69,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Toshiba provides only a small number of products that allow you to play your favorite VHS tapes so you don't have to transfer everything to Blu-ray or DVDs.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-07-05T20:02:22Z","id":"s5PoV2sZroPkzQRZfc95C6","meta":{"title":"Toshiba DVD Recorder DVR620 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read about the Toshiba DVD/VCR combo players and discover how easy it is to play your favorite video tapes."},"products":[{"slug":"toshiba-dvd-recorder-dvr620","url":"/product/toshiba-dvd-recorder-dvr620","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:55:58Z","name":"Toshiba DVD Recorder DVR620","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:55:58Z","id":"48vo7ErrRLHQzaCoViXUV3","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:55:59Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/Awg7Cc5y3hgJeg73639nKA.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:55:58Z","mimeType":"","name":"53207-toshiba-dvd-recorder-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/53207-toshiba-dvd-recorder-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:55:58Z","id":"Awg7Cc5y3hgJeg73639nKA","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Awg7Cc5y3hgJeg73639nKA.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Toshiba DVD Recorder DVR620 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read about the Toshiba DVD/VCR combo players and discover how easy it is to play your favorite video tapes."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/Awg7Cc5y3hgJeg73639nKA.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:55:58Z","mimeType":"","name":"53207-toshiba-dvd-recorder-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/53207-toshiba-dvd-recorder-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:55:58Z","id":"Awg7Cc5y3hgJeg73639nKA","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Awg7Cc5y3hgJeg73639nKA.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Toshiba DVD Recorder DVR620 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read about the Toshiba DVD/VCR combo players and discover how easy it is to play your favorite video tapes."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/home-entertainment/best-dvd-vcr-combo-players/toshiba-dvd-recorder-review/","label":"","tags":[]}
