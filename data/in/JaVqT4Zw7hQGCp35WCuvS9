Choosing the right solution is important because some software is geared toward business use while other options offer functions for direct use by homeowners within an association. Some software options include <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-online-property-management-software/\">TOPS Professional</a>, <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-online-property-management-software/\">Buildium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-online-property-management-software/\">Smart HOA</a>. You can also check out our other articles on HOA software.","<strong>HOA Software: What to Look For</strong>","Before you start your search for HOA management software, consider how you will use it so you know what features might be important for your organization and customers. Other considerations include how the software is delivered and who the target audience for the product is.","<strong>Cloud Based or Installed</strong><br/>Most software for HOA groups or businesses comes in either cloud-based or installed versions. Web-based cloud software resides online, offering versatile access options and reducing costs associated with server or hardware requirements. Installed versions might be a good choice for single offices or individuals managing an HOA environment, but client-side installations often restrict how information can be shared. For most HOA groups and related small-business environments, cloud software is a cost-effective and efficient solution.","<strong>Business or Organization</strong><br/>Most HOA property management software falls into two categories: software designed for property-management businesses and solutions designed for organizations run by homeowners. The former might include functions for accounting, maintenance and work order management and contracting. The latter is more likely to include membership management and communications functions as primary features. If a software seems to target business environments, it might not be the right choice for a group of homeowners and vice versa.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>Basic HOA community management requires features such as contact and membership management, directories, email functions, and document management. Nice-to-have features include community forums, calendars and online payment processing for HOA dues. Businesses managing subdivisions or condos can benefit from all of those features, but they would also want integrated accounting or the ability to interface with existing accounting software as well as property management solutions, such as online work tickets.","<strong>Security</strong><br/>Security is essential for any HOA program customer. At minimum, you need to safeguard homeowner data, which is likely to include full names, addresses, phone numbers and emails. If you accept online payments for either HOA fees or rent, you&#39;ll also require HOA solutions that are compliant with payment card industry standards. Secure software protects homeowners and business owners or associations.","A strong homeowner&#39;s association software program can reduce stress for committees or others in charge of the association. By streamlining processes and communications, you also reduce the risk of misunderstandings or inefficiencies. Choosing the right software can help you achieve these benefits."]},"id":"247c8d40-a6c2-4cac-b7a9-5d11d4dc7c54","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"c8a37d89-41bf-4999-8f3f-cc9810c4cd3a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/property/community-hoa-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">AssociationVoice</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/property/community-hoa-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">ATG</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/property/community-hoa-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">bazinga!</a>","<a href=\"http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=497917&u=113582&m=18498&afftrack=HoaManagement&urllink=learn.buildium.com%2Faffiliates%2F\">Buildium</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/property/community-hoa-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">CondoManager</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/property/community-hoa-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Interaction Community Systems</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/property/community-hoa-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">MyMemberData</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/property/community-hoa-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">myStrata</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/property/community-hoa-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">Smart HOA</a>","<a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com/property/community-hoa-software-comparison/price-quotes/?utm_source=TopTenReviews&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=product-cta&utm_content=landing-page-link\">TOPS Professional</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"5c06b7a8-382f-420c-9e63-c0107c1789f5","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1678","url":"/best-hoa-management-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-17T16:00:37Z","datePublished":"2015-09-11T22:34:21Z","name":"HOA Management Software Review","synopsis":"HOA management software lets homeowner associations or property companies manage rules, memberships and accounting.
