What’s so cool about it then? The idea behind the Sphero is it’s not simply a ball controlled by your iPod, tablet or smartphone; instead, it’s an entirely new peripheral available for mobile devices. Sphero&#39;s features and technology are all controlled by mobile apps, and the good news is that new apps are being released all the time – each one offering a different way to experience the Sphero. The gadget geek in your life will enjoy being the first person on the block to have a remote control ball they can drive with their mobile device, which is why it&#39;s one of the top ten <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lists/gift-ideas\">best Christmas gifts</a>.","The tech inside the Sphero is impressive, and it&#39;s compatible with most mobile devices running iOS or Android. The Sphero connects with your device via Bluetooth and has an effective range of over 50 feet. The primary control app features surprisingly responsive speed and movement controls. Prior to a firmware update, the device had an unfortunately wide turn radius, but it is now able to switch directions on point and moves much more fluidly as a result. Additionally, the Sphero is much more durable than appearances would suggest. In our testing, the Sphero withstood several falls from countertops and tables.","The great thing about the Sphero is your favorite gadget geek can download a handful of apps that utilize the Sphero as an accessory to their mobile device. The Chromo app, for example, utilizes the Sphero&#39;s gyroscope in a collection of memory and quick-thinking mini-games that require them to tilt the device in a certain direction to align with colors on the screen.","Other apps like Draw&amp;Drive and SpheroGolf provide other ways of using the Sphero to roll around the living room. Draw&amp;Drive lets you map out a specific trail on the screen that the ball will then follow, and SpheroGolf allows you to set a destination for the device to get to, using a gauge on screen to indicate how far the device should travel to get there with each stroke. It&#39;s important to keep in mind, however, that Sphero prefers to have a lot of room to work with, so you may be limited to drawing very small paths if there isn’t a large floor space.","There are a number of cool tricks you can do if you get the right app for the Sphero. Inside the ball there are LEDs that can light up virtually any color; it just requires the right app. The Draw&amp;Drive app allows you to draw paths for the Sphero to follow, and it can be entertaining to create neat designs and make the ball change color at certain points. There are also several macros built into the primary Sphero app which will send the device along a predetermined path such as a figure-8 or a zig-zag. An app called MacroLab allows you to create and customize your own macros. The range of options is impressive, and the Sphero responds well to the customized control schemes.","The Sphero does well enough as a stand-alone toy, but its true application is as an accessory to other apps that take advantage of its features and design. Apps like Sphero Exile and Last Fish provide a welcome variety to the all-too-familiar offerings of the app store. One potential drawback is the high price tag, but any tech geek will love using mobile apps to drive it, and several more enticing apps are in the works. This grown-up tech toy will delight whoever you give it to – the geekier they are, the more they’ll love it."]},"id":"dbdd8d3a-b5cf-46f5-bf9f-13e2a4224b9b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55457","url":"/sphero-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-16T20:45:58Z","datePublished":"2012-11-16T20:45:58Z","name":"Sphero","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.
