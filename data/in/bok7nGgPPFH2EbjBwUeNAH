You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Ronco <a href=\"/best-dehydrators\">5-tray Food Dehydrator</a> is an affordable and smart way to preserve fruit, vegetables and meat from the comfort of your own home.","Built with high-grade materials, the Ronco 5-tray Food Dehydrator’s design makes drying food easy. Its white base and clear lid allows food to be monitored during the entire dehydration process. This electric food dehydrator holds five 12 ½-inch-diameter interchangeable trays, and it can expand to seven trays, allowing more food to be dried at one time. Both lids and trays are easily removed and dishwasher safe. If you need a unit that makes even larger quantities, check out <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-dehydrators/cabelas-review/?status=InProgress\">Cabela&#39;s Commercial Food Dehydrator</a>.","Drying food in the Ronco is quiet due to its convection airflow. While most dehydrators use noisy fans or motors, this dehydrator uses electrical heating coils to produce the airflow. This device removes moisture from food and dries it evenly, which helps with its preservation. With 125 watts of drying power, food can be dehydrated at temperatures up to 133 degrees Fahrenheit. Dried food lasts up to three months in any sealed plastic bag or container.","The Ronco 5-tray Food Dehydrator comes with an instruction booklet and a recipe book full of ideas for all of your dehydrating ventures. You can also purchase fruit rollup trays and herb/flower screens separately.","Not only does the Ronco 5-tray Food Dehydrator do a great job at preserving your veggies, fruits, herbs and meats, it also doubles as a yogurt maker. You can make yogurt in the dehydrator with small plastic or glass cups with lids. Although there is some prep work involved with making the yogurt, it only takes about 8 hours for the process to be complete. A recipe for yogurt can be found in the recipe book.","The Ronco 5-tray Food Dehydrator dries bananas, turkey jerky, beef jerky and any other food you want to dehydrate. You just have to cut the food and place it in the trays.  Food is dried evenly and in a timely manner, saving you money and time on making your favorite snacks."]},"id":"95dcd611-d814-46aa-9abf-2e867edfd35a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61118","url":"/ronco-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-11T19:05:57Z","datePublished":"2014-11-11T19:05:57Z","name":"Ronco 5-tray Food Dehydrator","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-11-11T19:05:57Z","id":"bok7nGgPPFH2EbjBwUeNAH","meta":{"title":"Ronco 5-tray Food Dehydrator Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Ronco food dehydrator has five trays to increase the amount of food you can dry at once.
