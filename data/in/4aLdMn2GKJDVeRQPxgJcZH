Whether you&#39;re a Thanksgiving champion or a ramen noodle connoisseur, a reliable electric range is necessary for quality food in any home. <a href=\"/best-slide-in-ranges\">Slide-in ranges </a>are easy to install and come with a variety of features like those seen in the Bosch HEI7052U.","This 30-inch Bosch model combines the style and power of a high-end ceramic cooktop with European convection technology. The four large burners bring food to high temperatures quickly and the triple element adjusts to 5-, 7- and 9 –inch configurations to fit a range of cookware. The left side bridge element is a great partner for griddles and oblong pans that would otherwise be unstable on a coil stove. The touch controls work in tandem with the control knobs to avoid slips and ensure the oven&#39;s temperature is the one you want. The Bosch HEI7052U features eight cooking modes: bake, broil, dehydrate, proof, keep warm, Sabbath mode and convection roast and bake. These preset modes make it easy to begin cooking and the built-in timer keeps you on your toes regardless of what&#39;s in the oven.","The convection option activates a fan inside to circulate hot air around the 4.6 cubic foot oven chamber. Convection cooks firm food like meats and vegetables more effectively, but may blow around batter in more delicate pastries or cakes. This method of baking uses standard oven coils used in traditional baking, but moves the hot air around to keep the entire oven consistently hot. The self-cleaning feature in the Bosch HEI7052U uses convection to circulate temperatures up to 900 degrees inside the oven to char and burn off remaining food from the walls and surface of the oven. The Bosch HEI7052U has a stable stainless steel frame to make space for the hidden bake element and storage drawer. The hidden bake element is a cavity in the floor of the oven hiding a bake element to distribute heat evenly and boost heat in convection. This extra feature also assists in cleaning by serving as a place for ash and foodstuffs to collect. The storage drawer frees up cabinet space so you can store baking sheets and cookware under the oven.","This electric slide-in oven measures 35.75 inches high, 31 inches wide and 25.62 inches deep. Before installing, make sure you have the correct cut out space in your counter and enough room to slide the oven through doors and into your kitchen. Many online and in-store retailers offer installation or assistance, a good option if you live in an apartment or small quarters."]},"id":"783b7469-c3d6-493c-b205-fecfc3bf5ea2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58003","url":"/bosch-slide-in-range-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T12:55:55Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T12:55:55Z","name":"Bosch HEI7052U","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
