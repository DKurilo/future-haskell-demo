You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Broil King Regal Pro 956544 LP  <a href=\"/best-gas-grills\">gas grill</a> is a well-equipped backyard machine, and it should suit the needs of just about anyone, from grilling newcomers to barbecue masters. It has a powerful set of burners and plenty of cooking space, along with a few nice add-ons that make it a fierce competitor in the gas grill marketplace. The Broil King Regal Pro also has a nice warranty behind it, allowing you to feel safe in your purchasing decision.","The Broil King gas grill has four primary burners. These burners can generate up to 50,000 total BTUs. While BTUs are not the end-all-be-all of grill measurements, this number is impressive. This essentially means the Regal Pro gets hot and stays hot. There is also a 10,000 BTU side burner on this grill, which is ideal for cooking side dishes while the primary burners work on grilling your main dish. The electronic ignition system ensures that this gas grill is ready when you are, but one of the biggest benefits to this grill is the built-in rotisserie burner. Rotisserie burners like those found on the Regal Pro are ideal for cooking spit-roasted chicken and other unique barbecue items.","The Broil King Regal Pro has plenty of cooking space. Whether you&#39;re cooking for family, friends or the whole neighborhood, the 500 square inches of cooking real estate on the Regal Pro should be enough for most of your grilling needs. On top of that, this gas grill offers 195 square inches of warming rack space. The Regal Pro also has a built-in temperature gauge to help you stay on top of your cooking progress, and a side shelf that is ideal for storing extra items.","Another big plus for this gas grill is the natural gas option. Natural gas is on the rise as a fuel source for gas grills, so the inclusion of this option on the Regal Pro is nice to see.","Stainless steel makes up the bulk of the construction material for this gas grill, helping to prevent rust and wear. The cooking grates are porcelain-coated cast iron – an ideal material for those who wish to keep their grills neat and tidy. The porcelain coating keeps residue off the grating while searing your meat with the signature grill marks every backyard cooker hopes to achieve. The dense material makes this grill heavier than average at 185 pounds.","Broil King offers a 10-year warranty on the stainless steel burners in the Regal Pro gas grill, and a two-year warranty on other parts. Burners are the most important component of any gas grill, and it is important to have a long warranty on them to ensure that you&#39;ll be able to use your grill for as long as possible.","The Broil King website has a helpful FAQs section and an online manual. Almost any question you may have about the Broil King Regal Pro is likely already addressed on the website. However, if you need direct assistance, you can reach Broil King representatives by phone and email."]},"id":"5d712ed4-7e11-42f5-a46a-365f4824514c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9fa8e7a3-1714-45c1-b59b-0a3bf10bbc16","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Broil King Regal Pro is an excellent gas grill.
