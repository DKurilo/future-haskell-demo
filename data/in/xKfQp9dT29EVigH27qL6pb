They are all quiet enough that they won’t bother you or your neighbors, but they are not as energy efficient as some competitors’ models. Still, they’re likely to save you on your future electrical bills if you are replacing an outdated model. Some Goodman models also come with a lifetime warranty, which is impressive in today’s central air conditioner market.","These AC units meet all the Energy Star guidelines established by the Environmental Protection Agency to reward manufacturers that conserve energy. Goodman units have an average SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) performance rating of around 15.3. This is the lowest average SEER rating in our review, but still higher than the minimum federal standard of 13 SEER. With such a low average SEER rating, you can expect Goodman central AC units to be more affordable than the other brands we evaluated. However, even Goodman&#39;s best model, which has a SEER rating of 18, doesn&#39;t measure up to the very best central air conditioners from Lennox, Amana and <a href=\"/trane-review\">Trane</a>.","These air conditioning systems use environmentally friendly R-410A refrigerant. This refrigerant is chlorine-free and formulated to protect the ozone layer. Goodman&#39;s best central air conditioners also feature a two-stage scroll compressor that is specifically designed to have fewer moving parts. That means less energy consumption.","A high-density foam compressor sound blanket is available to reduce the sound from these AC units. But overall, you won&#39;t be bothered by the noise output of most of Goodman’s models.","Upkeep should be pretty simple with these AC units. The onboard diagnostics allow you to store up to six fault codes, so you will always know when a problem is developing. You also have multiple access points, simplifying repairs and annual upkeep.","One of the standout features of Goodman&#39;s central air conditioning systems is their warranty. Goodman units in the DSXC series have a lifetime warranty. If your air conditioning system fails and you are the original purchaser, you will receive a new unit as long as you still live in the same residence you purchased it for. Only two other brands in our review, Amana and Coleman have similar offerings. Goodman&#39;s other product line, GSX, as well as all parts are covered by a 10-year parts warranty. As with other central AC units, you must register your Goodman unit with the company within 60 days or settle for only five years of warranty coverage."]},"id":"7c9c3573-da5f-482b-a8c3-c32f216b1f2b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cb7b620f-226f-4866-a588-289058622be0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Goodman central AC units are energy-efficient products that can save you money over older generations of air conditioners.
