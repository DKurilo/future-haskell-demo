Its slick black design lets it easily blend in with the other electronics in your home entertainment center. The physical layout of the player is simple, and its remote is very functional and easy to use. This player also logged one of the fastest times in our tests for starting to play a DVD once we shut the tray. This is merely a matter of seconds, but for the impatient, a faster time is ideal.","The DVD-S700 can play standard as well as rewriteable DVDs and CDs from around the world, as it is region-free. The rewriteable disc formats the player supports include: DVD-R, DVD-R DL, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+R DL, DVD+RW, CD-R and CD-RW. You can also access your favorite digital media files – including videos, music and photos – since the DVD player has a USB port located on the front of the device. It supports MP3 audio files and JPEG picture files, and also has a photo slideshow function. It has a handy feature called upscaling that improves the image quality up to full HD 1080p, which corrects the brightness signals of the images in pixel units. It uses 4x oversampling for progressive scan and 8x for interlace scan playback.","If you need to stop a movie in the middle for some reason, this Panasonic marks where you leave off for the six most recent DVDs you’ve watched. Then when you want to resume, the player remembers this point and automatically resumes playback, so you don’t have to waste time trying to find where you were. It also has a similar feature that remembers where the disc stopped in case of a power failure.","There are RCA and HDMI ports for connecting the DVD player to your TV. The player measures 12.25 x 1.5 x 8 inches and weighs 2.43 pounds. If you want a smaller DVD player, consider the <a href=\"/craig-cvd401a-review\">Craig CVD401A</a>. The Panasonic ships with a remote control, which lets you access all functions and menu settings from the comfort of your couch."]},"id":"831d0970-9cd9-468f-b66d-8f56126aba5e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70205","url":"/panasonic-dvd-s700-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-07T15:48:18Z","datePublished":"2018-09-07T15:48:18Z","name":"Panasonic DVD-S700","synopsis":"The Panasonic DVD-S700 is the best standalone DVD player we reviewed.
