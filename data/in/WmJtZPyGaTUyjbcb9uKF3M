The base processor is a G3000 Intel Pentium, which is a lower-end chip. While it has enough power to do basic web browsing and word processing, it lacks the performance to run programs that are more complex. You may upgrade the Lenovo H to a superior chip, including a 4th generation Intel i7, if you desire more processing muscle.","The Lenovo H doesnâ€™t come with a wireless card, but it includes a slot for an 802.11 Wi-Fi card. You can purchase a card separately and install it after purchase if you want to upgrade the computer. The Lenovo H doesn&#39;t have a configuration that provides you Bluetooth. The lack of wireless options limits the devices you can use with this PC and lowers its usability. Wherever you place the computer in your home, you will have to plan to run wire to it in order to access the internet.","There is only a single hard drive on the Lenovo H. The base configuration gives you 500GB of storage, and you can upgrade that to 2TB of storage, which should be enough storage for most home multimedia uses. However, if you have a large movie, music or photo library, then you could be forced to use external hard drives for further storage. The base unit comes with 4GB of RAM, and the Lenovo H is upgradable to 16GB.","The Lenovo H includes a 16x DVD burner on the base configuration. You can upgrade the optical drive to a Blu-ray player, an option you won&#39;t find on other cheap PCs. The computer also includes an HDMI output, which means you can use a flat screen TV as a monitor and watch Blu-ray discs in full 1080p quality. The Lenovo H also has a memory card reader on the front of the computer. This lets you access the data from memory cards without using a USB adaptor.","Lenovo provides a one-year warranty with this personal computer. This limited warranty only covers manufacturer&#39;s defects. You can purchase an additional three-year warranty from Lenovo. Lenovo provides live chat service on their website, as well as email support, phone support and driver downloads."]},"id":"4f5b1c45-c03c-497e-ac04-3a260c21e5c9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ec1d989a-0389-4f93-a15b-f2c186974014","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Lenovo H is a tower computer that delivers a basic level of computing for home needs.
