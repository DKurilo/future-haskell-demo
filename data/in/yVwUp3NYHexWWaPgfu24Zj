The eReader has standard dimensions of 6.2 x 4.5 x 0.35 inches and a weight of 6.9 ounces; both marks are in line with comparable eBook readers.","During our hands-on testing, we found that the Glo HD&#39;s build quality is in line with its midrange price tag. Notably, the eBook reader is built with a rubberized back that prevents slipping, which is a nice addition typically found on the best eBook readers. Although there aren&#39;t huge aesthetic differences between the Glo HD and Kobo’s entry-level eReader – both have identical port layouts and straightforward black plastic bodies – the Glo HD feels hefty and durable when held in your hands.","The device’s display is another one of its strong points. The eReader has a 1448 x 1072 screen with a pixel density rating of 300 pixels per inch (ppi). Generally, displays at this resolution point are only found on the best eReaders. During our testing, we found that reading on the Glo HD was extremely easy, and onscreen text was sharp with virtually no pixelation.","The Glo HD&#39;s reading interface is cleanly laid out; navigation and readability settings are housed in a discreetly placed toolbar on the bottom of the screen. We also found it was easy to scroll between pages, and the device capably loaded pages without delay. Kobo&#39;s catalog can stand head-to-head with stores from competing eBook reader manufacturers, and we were able to find fiction and non-fiction titles from a variety of major authors. However, Kobo&#39;s content options do have some limitations. While subscriptions for magazines like Time and Vanity Fair are available, services like sharing support and subscription options from major newspapers are unavailable."]},"id":"7be6f440-fb1c-4f92-ba32-6a160fa6ba47","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"48f2261e-d9f5-4163-b959-7e66ca5fe2d4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["On the inside and outside, the Kobo Glo HD has a lot to offer if you&#39;re looking for an eReader.
