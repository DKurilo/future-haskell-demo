You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Portacool Cyclone 3000 can cool up to 700 square feet. This <a href=\"/best-portable-evaporative-coolers\">portable evaporative cooling unit</a> is intended for outdoor use or for use in partially enclosed areas. It is suited for locations in hot, dry conditions such as the southwest U.S. It works well in garages and workshops, on patios and around the pool and is ideal for cooling at outdoor events or on film locations in hot weather.","The best portable evaporative coolers provide affordable, effective cooling when it’s hot. You can use this portable swamp cooler to reduce the temperature up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit. This makes working in a hot garage or other workspace tolerable. You can extend the seasons you can work in places without climate control. It saves you money since it has a much lower cost of operation than an air conditioning unit.  It draws about as much energy as an average hair dryer.","The Cyclone 3000 has two methods to transport water to its cooling pads. There is an input for a standard garden hose in the back of the unit. It also has a 16-gallon reservoir in the bottom, which is much larger than that of most other portable evaporative coolers we looked at, such as the <a href=\"/honeywell-cs10xe-review\">Honeywell CS10XE</a>. Either of these can be used to move water into the cooling pads. It uses a fan to draw water into the back, through the cooling pads and out the front. There is a valve that controls the amount of water going into the cooler so you can adjust it based on the humidity.","The fan moves air with centrifugal force, so there are no fan blades. You don’t have to worry about having fan blades that will accumulate dirt and dust. Unlike an air conditioner, there are few moving parts, so it requires almost no maintenance. The front of the unit has adjustable louvers, so you can direct the airflow vertically, and the unit has wheels with locking casters, so it can be moved around to deliver air where it is needed. This cooler can be used with the fan only, or you can turn on the pump by flipping a switch to deliver evaporative cooling.","The unit has two fan speeds. One speed delivers air at 2,400 cubic feet per minute, and the higher speed delivers 3,000 cubic feet per minute. Both speeds are pretty strong. The housing is all in one piece and is rustproof and waterproof. Even though it is being used with water, typically outdoors, you don’t have to worry about rust deteriorating this portable evaporative cooling unit.","The Cyclone 3000 should be simple to use. It has a low cost to operate and requires little maintenance. It is a good cooling unit to consider if you are looking for a durable and effective tool that keeps you cool so you can do what you need to, anytime of year."]},"id":"a71bbdb5-81ba-4acc-ba6c-7475df8276e7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66095","url":"/portacool-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-09T13:32:41Z","datePublished":"2015-07-09T13:32:41Z","name":"Portacool Cyclone 3000","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-07-09T13:32:41Z","id":"U5JM5PYx6m4AGgaKS3qSh7","meta":{"title":"Portacool Cyclone 3000 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Portacool Cyclone 3000 is a portable evaporative cooling unit that cools 700 square feet.
