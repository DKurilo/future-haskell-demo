This makes it the lowest powered unit we tested. However, it will still produce the heat needed to cook your meat safely, even if it takes a bit longer to preheat. It also does a good job at distributing heat evenly and consistently. To test heat consistency, we measured the temperature of this grill with at seven, 14 and 21 minutes after ignition, as well as timing how long it takes to return to its preheated temperature after the lid had been open for one minute. After we complied the data from all the grills we reviewed, only the Char-Broil Patio Bistro and Char-Broil Performance performed better.
