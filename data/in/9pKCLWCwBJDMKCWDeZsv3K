The Beats Powerbeats2 is for athletes looking to supplement their workouts with music. This is reflected as much in the excellent sweat-proof durability and comfort as it is in the inconsistent audio quality.","The audio quality of the Powerbeats2 is average for <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">wireless in-ear headphones</a>, which may have more to do with the limitations of Bluetooth technology than it does with the driver&#39;s capabilities. The quality is inconsistent. At times, the audio sounds great and then becomes unbalanced. The bass seems to overtake the music and the treble clips and distorts. If you&#39;re using it for your workouts, you likely won&#39;t recognize the inconsistencies, but for leisure listening, it&#39;s very noticeable.","The call quality isn&#39;t great either. Since it lacks noise cancellation technology, your listener will hear everything around you. If you receive a phone call at the gym, your caller will struggle to hear your voice over the cacophony of the gym. However, this isn&#39;t a major flaw for most users. Call quality is one of the last characteristics you should consider with wireless Bluetooth earbuds, especially if you&#39;re using them to supplement your fitness regimen with music.","The battery life is six hours for both music streaming and talk time. This is average for battery life. It only takes 1.5 hours to recharge, which is faster than most wireless earbuds. It charges with a USB cord that is about half a foot long and plugs into your computer.","The best feature of the Powerbeats2 is the comfortable fit and durable design. It comes with four earbud sizes so that you can find the best fit for your ears. The drivers are angled for the optimal support within your ear canal, and it uses ear hooks for a stable fit. A clip allows you to adjust the cord that extends around the back of your neck for tight fit. The only comfort feature that it&#39;s missing is the ear fin. It&#39;s sweat-proof, water resistant and impact resistant. It can handle your most intense workouts."]},"id":"d460e869-25ed-4773-a4e8-905a82a9adfe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c98a65ab-bdef-4520-84cd-e4255a60887f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Beats Powerbeats2 doesn&#39;t have great audio quality for streaming music, and the lack of noise cancellation means that the call quality is subpar compared to the best wireless earbuds.
