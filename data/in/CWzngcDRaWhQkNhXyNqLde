You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Panasonic Canister Vacuum Cleaner MC-CL310 quickly and effectively vacuums hard floors. With an 11-amp motor, the vacuum relies on strong suction to pick up dirt, hair and food. In the tests we conducted, the vacuum impressively picked up all of the sawdust we scattered.","This <a href=\"/best-hardwood-floor-vacuum-cleaners\">hard floor vacuum</a> has a large collection capacity reaching almost 48 ounces. As a canister vacuum, it uses a hose and an attachment brush to vacuum up messes. However, you cannot adjust the height of the attachments.","This vacuum for hardwood floors has tools that only work on delicate surfaces, such as hardwood floors. While you cannot control the suction, you shouldn&#39;t need to, since this model is intended only to vacuum hard floors. The vacuum uses a HEPA filter that captures allergens, irritants and particles. It also has a button release canister so you can empty the vacuum without exposing the contents to your face.","The hard floor vacuum only weighs 13 pounds, making it easy to carry the hose and canister. It has a 16-foot cord and an 8-inch cleaning path. Both the cord and cleaning path are comparatively smaller than other models, which means you will cover less surface and have to switch outlets more often. However, the cord is retractable so you won’t have to wind it up after each cleaning.","The vacuum’s hose reaches 6 feet and has several cleaning tools you can attach to it. With a dusting brush, a crevice tool and an extension wand, you can vacuum hard-to-reach places with ease. The tools use gentle bristles that help attract and gather dust. Each of the tools is gentle enough to use on wooden floors without the worry of scratching them.","Panasonic’s vacuum has a one-year warranty on parts and labor. If you have problems with your vacuum, you can contact the company by phone or email. The site also has a searchable FAQs section. If you need to repair your vacuum, you can find nearby service centers on the website."]},"id":"59bc5117-1414-490f-8adb-cf2e99fae3e8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fa5ba973-9973-4137-bdcd-d20c21286fbf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Panasonic Canister Vacuum Cleaner MC-CL310 was designed to clean hard floor surfaces.
