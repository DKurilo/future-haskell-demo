Instead of frames, these panels have mounting holes between the cells and can be mounted on trademarked Lumos rails. These have a low profile and can blend in appealingly with any home design.","As an additional effort to enhance the aesthetics of these solar panels, Lumos lets you also choose among module back sheets that are black, clear or white, depending upon what looks best on your roof.","When it comes to maximum power output, these panels provide a respectable 250 watts. They offer a maximum voltage of 30.1 volts and a maximum power current of 8.31 amps. The panels come with 60 cells per module. Despite their all-glass appearance, these modules are strong enough to handle hailstones approximately one-inch in diameter that are whipped by winds up to 52 mph. These can operate in temperatures ranging from 40 degrees below zero to 185 degrees F.","As far as panel dimensions go, these come in at 64.6 inches in length, 39.1 inches in width and 1.38 inches in depth. Each weighs 62.6 pounds. They can handle loads of snow up to 50 pounds per square foot with the portrait-style arrangement of panels and 113 pounds per square foot with the landscape arrangement.","If you have questions, you can contact the company by phone or email. Lumos Solar also provides an informative blog on its website on which you may find a variety of brief articles that keep you up to date with what is happening, not only with Lumos and its products, but with solar energy in general."]},"id":"f9efce24-04ef-49e9-bb73-7018ad852b15","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d61337dd-8146-43f7-b11c-13babd5dd903","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Lumos LSX250-60M solar panels are sleek and modernistic in design and appearance, offer healthy durability and power.
