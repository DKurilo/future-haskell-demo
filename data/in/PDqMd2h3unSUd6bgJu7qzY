The webcams were thoroughly researched and tested, with all the specs logged, and features and functionality studied and compared. We considered each device’s overall design, video and audio quality, features, and ease of use, all while examining how effective each would be for users of all requirements and experience levels. We also investigated each company’s technical support and various informational resources available from the manufacturer, as well as looked over the accompanying warranty. ","We found that, when it comes to webcams, you get what you pay for. However, the most useful features for any budget and experience level included automatic focus, glass lenses, long cords, high-quality audio and picture, along with the ability to shoot 1080p video at 30 frames per second, are the best webcams.","<strong>How Much Do Webcams Cost?</strong> ","When you buy a webcam, consider the quality of the camera, the microphone and the build. Webcams are as low as $5 on Amazon and other electronics sites, but these cams have either poor cameras or poor construction. The most popular and highly rated webcams fall between $30 and $100. However, if you use your webcam often and you need the highest quality video, audio and maneuverability, choose a webcam between $500 and $950. These webcams have the best cameras and have robotic frames and bases with remotes to adjust the camera from a distance.","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying a Webcam</strong>","Price<br/>When you buy a webcam, consider the quality of the camera, the microphone and the build. Webcams costs as little as $5 on Amazon, but these models have either poor cameras or poor construction. The most popular and highly rated webcams fall between $30 and $100. However, if you use your webcam often and need the highest quality video, audio and maneuverability, choose one that costs between $500 and $950. These webcams have the best cameras as well as robotic frames and bases with remotes to adjust the camera from a distance.","Video Quality<br/>Video resolution and frame rate are some of the most important specifications to consider when looking at webcams. You should also look at still image resolution if you frequently take pictures. The webcams we compared top out at 1080p, which is high enough to create clear, detailed pictures. However, because of how much it costs to build webcams with that kind of quality, most less expensive models have lower resolutions. Webcams at lower price points more commonly shoot 720p video.","Similarly, lower price models shoot at slower frame rates. The webcams we tested max out at 30 frames per second (fps) at their highest resolutions, which works for most applications. More expensive webcams can handle up to 60 fps, which is useful for layering player video over a 60 fps video game stream, for example. Recently, webcams capable of 4K video quality have become less prohibitively expensive as well.","Another facet of video quality is the webcam’s software features, including light adjustment, color correction and face tracking. These features make up for bad or weird lighting and prioritize your face as the visual focus, as opposed to anything in the background. You shouldn&#39;t have to fiddle too much with a high quality webcam&#39;s settings for these features to work. <br/><br/>Audio<br/>Though you probably won’t get fantastic audio from a webcam, your device should have at least decent sound quality so you can video chat. To that end, choose a webcam with at least one microphone and noise reduction, which is programmed to isolate the human vocal range and reduce the volume of ambient noise. However, for higher sound quality, you may need to invest in separate equipment like a standalone mic or a headset with an integrated mic.","Focus Style<br/>There are three types of focusing systems available to choose from: autofocus, manual and fixed. Each system has its pros and cons. Auto and manual focusing lets the camera’s focal point be adjusted. Fixed focus lenses only focus on a single spot and can’t be adjusted.","Autofocus is the best, most powerful option as it automatically keeps you in focus, even if you’re fidgeting or moving around. Because it does all the heavy lifting for you, an autofocus system is great for beginners and advanced users alike, but it generally costs more. This is a critical feature to have if you’re streaming or doing video-intensive recording, as it works automatically to get the best picture. You can keep concentrating on your conversation or game without needing to worry about constantly adjusting the focus.","Manual focus also allows the camera to be adjusted to the optimal focal point. It gives you full control over where to focus, but you’ll have to adjust it every time you move or want to change the focal point. Having total control lets you create the perfect shot. Manual focus is found on pricey and budget-friendly options alike. Fixed focus, on the other hand, has a predetermined focal range that you can’t adjust. This option requires less technology to be built into the webcam, so it’s typically what’s found in lower-priced devices. It’s also a great option for novice users or those who know they’ll be sitting still while using the webcam.","Lens Material<br/>Whether your webcam’s lens is made of glass or plastic also has an impact on the overall image quality. Glass, obviously, is the higher-quality material, but it contributes to a higher price. The top webcams use high-end glass to create resilient, crystal-clear video and photos. Plastic lenses are less expensive but are easily scratched and make for lower image quality.","Webcam Placement<br/>How the webcam can be mounted is another factor to consider. Most devices can be mounted atop your monitor using an included clip or placed on a desk. One downside to this mounting style is lack of mobility, but many allow minor tilt and pan adjustments. These options work for most users. Some webcams also have universal mounts that give them compatibility for being mounted on a tripod. Typically, these units can still be mounted on a desk or on top of a monitor, but it gives you more flexibility, depending on your needs. ","<strong>Should You Buy a Webcam?</strong>","Many computers have webcams built in. However, they usually aren’t as powerful and feature-rich as standalone units, nor do you have control over what kind of focus system or video capture speed it has; however, few people choose a computer based on the integrated webcam.
