We here at TopTenREVIEWS have compiled a listing of the best of the best <a href=\"/best-remote-control-boats\">remote control boat stores</a> in existence today and given each one of them a comprehensive and painstakingly detailed inspection in order to come up with the reviews and rankings we provide to you at no extra charge. ","The very first decision you have to make is just exactly what type of remote control boat you want, unless you know that already. In that case, keep on reading this article. You might see one that you hadn t even considered or didn t even know was out there. So, we ll take at least some of the guesswork out of your shopping process and detail for you three of the most popular categories of remote control boats, along with some descriptions of specific makes and models.","<strong>R/C Sail Boats</strong>","If you have seen the movie,  The Great Outdoors,  you are no doubt familiar with the scene where John Candy s character talks about peacefully cruising around the lake in comfort. Well, he was talking about a pontoon boat, but the basic idea is the same when it comes to sail boats, be they life-sized or remote control models. Even though the movie kind of poked fun at the whole cruise-the-lake-in-comfort idea, there is something to be said for the relaxation and serenity one can get just by being around boats and the water.","Most remote control sail boats have a simple, basic design. They are traditionally about 30 to 39 inches long, with an average mast height of about 51 inches. They tend to be made out of wood or fiberglass and come with the necessary amounts of sails, lettering and numbers, and logo decals.","<strong>R/C Racing Boats</strong>","These boats give you a perfect example of the other side of the story. They are on the side of Dan Aykroyd s character, who wants to slice through the waves with a jet boat for the day.","If you ve ever seen one of those open water boat races where use these boats that almost sit flat on the water to reach speeds of more than 200 miles per hour, then you ve seen what these remote control racing boats look like. However, you can t ride in those boats, unfortunately, but you can experience the next best thing with these racing boats.","<strong>R/C Submarines</strong>","Some of you who are new to the wonderful world of remote control vehicles might not have even known that there was such a thing as a remote control submarine. Well, there is; and they re pretty dang cool.","Remote control subs are typically made out of impact resistant acrylonitrile butadiene styrene or ABS plastic. This sturdy outer hull allows it to submerge to a depth of about 10 feet, depending on the make and model. They normally come with a 12-volt motor, which allows it to swim along at about 2 miles per hour. ","So, as you can see, remote control boats come in all shapes, sizes and speed. If you re already experienced with one type of boat, perhaps now is the time to try your skills and abilities on another type.
