Web hosting services can be divided into four separate categories: shared, co-location, dedication and in-house. Each type caters to a specific niche of users, providing different administrative and connectivity services.  Not sure which type you need for your new website? Here s a breakdown of what each type of hosting entails and the prospective users that are apt for each type.","<strong>Shared Hosting</strong>   <a href=\"/best-web-hosting\">Shared hosting</a> (also called virtual hosting) refers to a type of hosting where several websites are hosted on one server and you essentially  rent  disk space from a web hosting company that owns the server. Each site resides on its own partition (or section) of the server to the keep it separate from the other websites.","Since there are no upfront expenses for hardware and the cost of server maintenance is spread out among several users, shared hosting is generally the most economical type of hosting. The web hosting provider is responsible for the most costly aspects of the service including managing servers, installing server software, providing technical support and running security updates. Thus, it s an ideal and inexpensive option for personal users and budget-conscious small to mid-size businesses. Pricing for shared hosting typically starts at just a few dollars a month and can vary on package allocations and capabilities, such as email features and how much disk space and bandwidth you need.","Aside from pricing, there are a few other factors to keep in mind when considering shared hosting. Virtually any application or website designed for a standard web server (e.g., basic eCommerce sites, personal and company websites, blogs, etc.) will work fine with shared hosting. However, a more robust web hosting solution may be required for power users who want more control over their site, especially since shared hosting often imposes usage limits.","<strong>Colocation Hosting</strong>   Colocation is a web hosting option that allows you to place your own server in someone else s data center. While you are responsible to maintain that server, they provide high-speed internet connectivity, a dedicated IP address and power for your server.","Colocation is ideal for businesses who want the benefits and features of a large IT department without the steep costs associated with powering and maintaining a secure environment for a server. However, server maintenance and finding a colocation provider in near proximity are disadvantages that often steer businesses toward shared hosting or dedicated hosting, especially for larger companies with more complex hosting needs.","<strong>Dedicated Hosting</strong>   This type of web hosting refers to when a client leases an entire server from a provider and does not share it with anyone. This differs from colocation hosting in that while you still have full control over the server, you do not own the server   the provider does. Subsequently, the provider is responsible for purchasing server hardware, installing software and maintaining the server.","Dedicated hosting is often used by companies that provide mission-critical eCommerce or interactive websites that have significant data transfer and high-speed requirements. For instance, a company that provides a web-based service or system for myriad clients or a well-known eCommerce site that has thousands of product pages may opt to use dedicated hosting because it best meets their needs.","<strong>In-House Hosting</strong>   This type of web hosting is when a company houses its own servers. It is also the most expensive type of hosting since it requires real estate and highly trained technical staff. Given how expensive it is, in-house hosting is generally utilized by companies that have the funds and technical staff to support it  global corporations (think IBM or Microsoft) and it s not typically a viable or cost-effective option for most businesses.","Whether you want to start a website or expand your current one, understanding the different types of web hosting available is crucial. Shared hosting is generally the most cost-effective option for most personal and business websites, but if you plan to grow or expand your site, it s important to know what other site hosting options are available."]},"id":"85951b89-73a1-416e-ba18-3220ca6dc640","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5812","url":"/web-hosting-which-type-is-right-for-you","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"katie-nielsen","url":"/author/katie-nielsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Katie Nielsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"YmLdvmc8SsWJaWuhhXXYSW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-04-18T18:31:11Z","datePublished":"2011-04-18T18:31:11Z","name":"Web Hosting: Which Type Is Right for You?","synopsis":"Web hosting is a vital and necessary component of any successful website; a site that has no web hosting cannot be accessed on the internet.","review":{},"strapline":"Web hosting is a vital and necessary component of any successful website; a site that has no web hosting cannot be accessed on the internet.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-10-06T18:05:22Z","id":"UH5AN5g4z9VUoRm8uENFAe","meta":{"title":"Web Hosting: Which Type Is Right for You?","description":"Learn about the different types of web hosting and which type is right for your website."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:56:54Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/BLd6aZkztH9wFGvNUhwPck.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:56:54Z","mimeType":"","name":"5812-web-hosting-which-type-is-right-for-you-.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5812-web-hosting-which-type-is-right-for-you-.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:56:54Z","id":"BLd6aZkztH9wFGvNUhwPck","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BLd6aZkztH9wFGvNUhwPck.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Web Hosting: Which Type Is Right for You?","description":"Learn about the different types of web hosting and which type is right for your website."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/BLd6aZkztH9wFGvNUhwPck.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:56:54Z","mimeType":"","name":"5812-web-hosting-which-type-is-right-for-you-.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5812-web-hosting-which-type-is-right-for-you-.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:56:54Z","id":"BLd6aZkztH9wFGvNUhwPck","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BLd6aZkztH9wFGvNUhwPck.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Web Hosting: Which Type Is Right for You?","description":"Learn about the different types of web hosting and which type is right for your website."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/services/articles/web-hosting-which-type-is-right-for-you/","label":"","tags":[]}
