In testing, we evaluated its brightness and color rendering abilities with a colorimeter in a dark environment. Even though it has LED-based hardware, the ML550 demonstrated phenomenal color accuracy, with a Delta-E of 8 – when measuring color accuracy, the closer the colorimeter readout is to zero, the better the projector displays a spectrum of colors.","The projector’s performance is notable when compared to the other devices – both LED and laser models – in our review. To put the ML550’s score into context, midrange LED-based pico projectors generally had readouts in the 15 to 25 range in our test. Similarly priced laser projectors – which generally have better image fidelity because of more efficient projecting hardware – produced readouts of around 8 to 15.","Our hands-on evaluations confirmed the projector’s quality. Whether we were watching animated content, YouTube videos or detailed dramas, the Optoma didn’t miss a step. In dark and bright viewing environments, images were clear and detailed. The ML550’s throw ratio of 1.5:1 – the distance the projector is from a display versus the size of the broadcasted image – is one of the longest in our review. This can make projecting tricky if you are working in a small space."]},"id":"83af869c-c424-456a-96c7-2b2777d9c1fe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Projection System"},"id":"b99fbf45-448c-4dc9-be02-7a9a6d19a20d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/n3AqXgrGP6ZWL7gtHNoQgd.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/68454-optoma-ml5502.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n3AqXgrGP6ZWL7gtHNoQgd.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"n3AqXgrGP6ZWL7gtHNoQgd","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n3AqXgrGP6ZWL7gtHNoQgd.jpg","alt":""},"id":"d0b5cbfe-4880-4737-82e1-095dc23d246c","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["On its rear, the Optoma has a fairly standard set of connections.
