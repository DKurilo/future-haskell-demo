You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Kenmore 68102 is a midrange <a href=\"/best-dryers\">clothes dryer</a> with overall solid performance, but a limited number of dryer cycles. The 68102 has a nice capacity of 7.6 cubic feet, which should be big enough to facilitate your biggest laundry jobs. It also has the industry standard five temperature settings, allowing you to accurately adjust the temperature to accommodate the different types of laundry you are drying.","While the total number of six cycles is on the low side, the cycles it offers are useful for people who like to keep it simple. It has a permanent press cycle, which is sometimes not found even on higher-end laundry dryers with a dozen cycles or more. It also includes a delicate, heavy duty and anti-bacterial/sanitize cycle. The sanitize cycle is what it touts above some of the others, since it is a cycle many buyers will be interested in. The express dry cycle is especially effective for you, especially if you wake up late and are in a rush to get to work and still need to dry your clothes.","The powder-coat drum is designed to reduce friction and wear on clothing. While a stainless steel drum is our preference, this is not a bad alternative and gets the job done. The lint filter in front makes for easy access and will make it easy to maintain on a day-to-day basis. It also has a moisture sensor, so you won’t have the problem of over-drying your clothes, which can be a safety hazard in addition to putting extra wear and tear on your clothes.","The dryer is also equipped with noise reduction technology and a reversible door, with a window. We mention this because many mid- to low-range dryers don’t offer these features, making this a worthwhile option to consider.","Kenmore’s customer service options include email and chat. They also have an owner’s manual you can download from their main website. We had a problem downloading it, however. Sears, the manufacturer of Kenmore products, also provides a chat service, yet finding it will take some patient navigation.","When you go to their contact options, a chat option isn’t listed since it is a general chat service for Sears customers, not one specifically for Kenmore. We found the chat because a chat box popped up when we clicked on the link to download a user’s manual. When you ask them questions about a Kenmore dryer you may be transferred a couple times, but they are helpful and you should eventually get answers to your questions."]},"id":"5bbb00b1-40bd-4db1-9410-b5d267592088","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"07655934-6e3e-45e6-824a-589eef880cec","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore 68102 is a great dryer for people not looking for a lot of extras, but want a basic clothes dryer to wash their clothes quickly and effectively.
