It has a respectable resolution of 2.1 megapixels, a built-in flash and some nice durability features. But the Nerf Digital Camera is one of the least expensive cameras on our lineup, and its features and performance reflect this.","Durability is by no means a strong suit of this camera. In fact, the first camera we received for testing was faulty. However promptly it was replaced, that doesn&#39;t bode well for the durability of any product. Aside from this hiccup, the actual physical construction of the camera is tough compared to comparably priced kids digital cameras.","The exterior of this digital camera for children sports reinforcements in high-wear areas like the corners and sides. These reinforcements protrude from the camera and should absorb the brunt of any impacts. Additionally, a rubber flap covers the camera&#39;s single port and helps to keep moisture and debris out of its vulnerable components.","This camera doesn&#39;t have a viewfinder, so kids must frame their shots using a 1.5-inch LCD display instead. It does, however, have a built-in flash for capturing images in dim lighting. Internal storage is minimal with only 100-image capacity â€“ significantly less than the category average of over 500.","Like many inexpensive options, this kids camera doesn&#39;t have much in the way of additional features or games. In fact, it has practically none at all. To make matters worse, the menus are confusing and often prove difficult for kids to master quickly.","Like all of the Sakar cameras in our review, the Nerf Digital Camera comes with a one-year warranty, which we unfortunately had to invoke. If you have any issues with this camera, you can contact Sakar representatives fairly easily by phone or email. Each camera also comes equipped with software and a helpful user manual."]},"id":"99c5d744-4d66-4638-ad11-eea9b5213c51","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dbbfd280-e938-4f83-bece-0eb986f56cea","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sakar Nerf Digital Camera isn&#39;t the toughest, the most feature rich or well designed, but it is inexpensive.
