We looked at programs that are easy enough for beginners to use as well as more sophisticated software. As we tested, we considered what each program can do and its price.","During our research, we spoke with Drew Tyler, instructor of digital media at Weber State University. He said one of the chief things to remember about downloading content is to use it for legal purposes. “If you’re downloading something to avoid a purchase or use it for commercial purpose or to make money, you’re crossing a line.” He also told us some of the reasons he downloads videos. “Two main reasons, one is because I want to show a video where I don’t have internet access. The other is collecting parts and pieces of videos to make something else, like completions and demo reels.”","We also spoke to Greg Andersen of Andersen Media in South Weber Utah. He said that downloading videos is sometimes required to finish his work. “Many of my clients show me particular video that they enjoyed and want something similar.” He also pointed out that you may need only the audio portion of a video. “Sometimes clients had a convention where they were the speaker, and they don’t want the video part of it, they just want the audio to integrate into their online platform or share with their own clients.”","Both men stressed the importance of picking software with multiple download options – for example programs that lets you pick the resolution and file format of the video. They also both mentioned that the best programs are simple to use and don’t have a steep learning curve.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We spent more than 40 hours testing video downloader software, which combined with our other research, led to our scoring and ranking the 10 best products on the market. We began with research, checking manufacturer websites, examining products and verifying the marketing claims made about them, then selected 13 applications that looked promising. We then conducted several tests, using the same testing methodology on all 13 applications, to see how well the actual performance compared to the marketing pitch.","We particularly looked at how easy or difficult an application was to use, and we learned that most products we chose were relatively easy. However, some were so complicated they would be problematic for most consumers who have a reasonable level of technological skills. We checked the download and conversion process, what services – such as YouTube, Facebook and the like – synced with software products, and the level of customer support. We found several excellent video download applications on the market, but noted that the best ones offer extra features such as browser plug-ins, file format conversion and the ability to enjoy videos on other kinds of devices besides laptop or desktop computers.","<strong> How Much Does Video Downloader Software Cost?</strong>","We’ve found that on average, video downloader software costs between $25 and $60, though you can find programs as cheap as $9. Average users shouldn&#39;t have to spend more than $30 to get a program that includes the features they need.  ","Typically, more expensive programs have extra features – for example, they may automatically download videos you view on the internet, mobile services and apps. High-end software also often has more video conversion formats to choose from. But be wary: Not all the programs&#39; prices are justified. For instance, AllMyTube had some of the best features and tools of all of the software we tested and only costs $30. In comparison, GetFLV costs $60 but lacks high-end features and is less user-friendly. ","<strong>What to Look for in Video Downloader Software<br/></strong><br/>How Much Does Video Downloader Software Cost?<br/>Video downloader software costs anywhere from $9.99 to $59.95. However, the most expensive software isn’t as good as our top choice, which is about $30 cheaper. There’s no need to pay top dollar for this type of program.","Conversion Capabilities<br/>The best video downloaders can convert downloaded videos into other video file formats. This means that if you download an MP4 video, the program can convert it to an AVI, MOV, WMV or any other common format. Some software can automatically convert videos once they finish downloading, which shortens the overall process since you don’t have to manually convert your downloads.","Use With Other Devices<br/>Some software can optimize your download conversion for specific devices, with the best able to have more than 100 preprogrammed optimization files that run the gamut from iOS and Android smartphones and tablets to gaming systems like the PlayStation and Xbox.","Extras<br/>The best applications let you to choose the resolution of the video you’re downloading, and many also can capture just the audio content. This is useful if you find a lecture or audio-centric video you like. You simply download the audio, sync it to a mobile device and listen to it the same way you would an audiobook or podcast.","Sharing Sites<br/>It’s essential for any video downloader software to work with YouTube, and it is quite helpful for it to work with other sharing sites as well. The software we examined can download videos from nearly any site."]},"id":"cd26d4f9-2257-4c6a-aa08-8b37d251b52c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_249","url":"/best-video-downloader-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
