The Q3 has been around for years with very few improvements, but it&#39;s still among the top Bluetooth headsets because of its excellent voice command integration. However, the lackluster call quality and noise cancellation don&#39;t compare to the best Bluetooth headsets we reviewed.","The Q3 scored 90 percent in our voice quality test, which is average among the Bluetooth headsets we reviewed. Considering the 65 percent score that the phone&#39;s speaker received in the same test, it&#39;s a notable improvement over holding your phone to your ear. However, there are better, clearer Bluetooth earpieces available.","In our noise reduction tests, the BlueAnt Q3 scored 80 percent, which is slightly below average. Your caller can hear a significant amount of background noise, which leads to you repeating yourself. In addition, the digital signal processor has a tendency to distort the background noises so that it sounds like you&#39;re talking underwater.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"70ec1b77-2923-445a-8603-e856a848a342","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For comfort, the BlueAnt Q3 includes only one gel earbud. The earbud we received lacked a concha fin, an extension that fits into the hollow part of the ear for a more secure fit. For added stability, it comes with two over-ear hooks, which provide the best support for long periods. However, even with the over-ear hooks, it only scored 50 percent in our stability tests, which means it&#39;ll easily fall out of your ear or need to be adjusted if you move around a lot while wearing it.","The continuous talk time for the Q3 is seven hours, which is a little above average. This gives you time for long, important business calls. However, the charge time is two hours, which is longer than most wireless headsets require. It also lacks a portable charger, which has become a staple among the best Bluetooth headsets because it can extend the talk time to a full day."]},"id":"b58402f5-e261-4fe1-9eb8-8f70c66eff65","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1d90b3a9-8a1c-4ba5-8554-08b73294dda6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BlueAnt Q3 gives your voice a lot of power with comprehensive voice commands and audio streaming.
