It’s powerful in its basic configuration but even more so with the substitution of a number of high end options.

It can be at the center of family financial management one moment and helping the kids do homework with everything from word processing and report preparation to online research the next. It keeps us in touch with family and friends and world events. It’s also likely to be asked to be a media center and a gaming console as the day progresses.","The Lenovo IdeaCentre K320 is powerful enough to be a top choice for all of those applications. In its basic configuration, it features an Intel Core i3-530 processor which has a fast clock speed of 2.93GHz, 1333MHz front side buss speed and a large 4MB cache. The chip has two cores and four threads so you can liken it to your data speeding along an eight lane freeway.","The CPU can be upgraded to a faster Intel Core i5-750 running at 2.66GHz, the same 1333MHz FSB and the cache doubled to 8MB for nearly instantaneous access to recently used information. The fact that the clock speed is slower than the above i3 is deceptive because this i5, with four cores and four threads is akin to the data flying along a 16 lane freeway so it will process far more information than the i3 despite slightly faster speed rating. An even faster Intel Core i7 is available as well.","It goes without saying that a high powered processor needs substantial memory to work at its best. Included RAM is a substantial 4GB, enough for most users and applications but it can be augmented all the way up to 8GB.","The computer comes equipped with Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 4500 card. It will provide great graphics for most applications but, without any dedicated video RAM, is likely to fall short for serious gaming.  If graphics intensive applications, including modern games, it might be worth upgrading to the available NVIDIA  GeForce G310 with its 512MB of dedicated video RAM or even to the extreme performance ATI Hemlock HD DX11.","There are hard disc drive options available to suit any just about anybody’s requirements as well. The standard HDD is a large 500GB but it can be increased to 640GB or even a massive 1TB. There’s an easy access bay which would allow the user to add a second HDD if desired. The computer also includes a DVD player/burner and a 16-in-1 memory card reader.","The K3320 comes with the Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium operating system. It has a one year parts and labor warranty which can be expanded to two or three years."]},"id":"d695ff72-5be1-474d-b425-25b88569d216","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cf5aae97-ecc4-4bb4-a9a1-2ae809253f33","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Lenovo IdeaCentre K320</strong> is a powerful, versatile computer in its base configuration.
