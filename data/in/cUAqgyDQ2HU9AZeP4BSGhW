However, the application loses points due to how long the ripping product takes and the fact that it lacks any tools to burn those movies onto a new DVD. These features and more have earned this produc the Top Ten Reviews Bronze Award.","In our tests of the best Blu-ray converter software, Pavtube is off the charts when it comes to the quality of the produced copy. In fact, if there was any quality loss after the ripping process, we couldn’t detect it. A converted video is of similarly high quality. When we converted a Blu-ray movie to a DVD format, the quality was as good as or better than most store-bought DVD movies.","The latest incarnation of Pavtube has made marked improvement over previous additions. The interface is a sleek, handsome and intuitive experience that even the most novice user should have little trouble acclimating to. Unlike lesser Blu-ray rippers that have obsolete interfaces and require training and tutorials to utilize their full potential, Pavtube is ready to use right out of the box.","One of the things we like most about Pavtube is the fact that it can remove the latest copy protections from commercial Blu-ray discs without the need to install a third-party decryption application.","As with all things, the high-quality results produced by Pavtube come with some tradeoffs. In our tests, this Blu-ray to DVD converter software was the slowest in terms of ripping and converting Blu-ray discs. We ripped and converted a copy of &#34;Back to the Future&#34;; the entire process took more than five hours to complete – far and away the slowest of any Blu-ray ripper we reviewed.","If there is one thing that kept Pavtube out of award-winning territory in this category, it would be the inability to burn to new discs. Once a movie is ripped and converted, you’ll need to use a DVD burner application to make a new disc. This is disappointing, because otherwise Pavtube was an all-in-one application. Little (if anything) would keep this Blu-ray ripper out of one of our top spots if burning functionality were included."]},"id":"99c234f8-7e32-4c80-853c-190b12b15c77","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f377d26a-436d-413d-bbd5-81a2c37001b5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Pavtube is an excellent tool for decrypting, ripping and converting your Blu-ray movies.
