While it&#39;s small enough to install almost anywhere, this unit is not portable and works best when installed on a high wall or ceiling mount.","An aluminum frame and fan make the Berko HUH durable enough for garage use; however, this industrial electric heater heats up quickly and should be installed out of reach where it can be a safety risk for small children. The built-in mount allows you to attach it with both vertical and horizontal airflow, allowing you to fit the electric heater into any space and direct heat wherever you want.","At 14 inches wide, 12.5 inches tall and 11.25 inches deep, this industrial heater is a good fit for smaller areas, especially a corner of your workshop or garage. The electric thermostat adjusts from 45 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing you to raise temperatures as much as you want. Fan control and automatic shutoff ensure the fan does not kick on until the heating element is up to temperature and that the unit shuts off as soon as the room reaches the desired temperature so it doesn&#39;t waste energy.","The industrial electric heater runs on 220-volt to 240-volt power, making it suitable for any area with a 220-volt plug. Because it runs on electricity, it is safe to use in offices, basements and other unventilated areas without installing a vent or flue. This makes it suitable for quick installation in an area that only needs supplemental heat or for providing primary heat for a small room or area.","The Berko HUH524TA is an industrial electric heater suitable for quickly warming small spaces like garages or small workshops. However, it is not portable and is best suited for attaching to a ceiling or high wall, which can be a disadvantage if you have limited electric outlets."]},"id":"2f66a5ef-e173-4fb1-a673-440f0f9a07f2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66817","url":"/berko-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-04T20:59:10Z","datePublished":"2015-09-04T20:59:10Z","name":"Berko HUH524TA","synopsis":"The Berko HUH524TA industrial space heater offers electrical heating for small- to medium-size businesses, garages and warehouses with a maximum BTU output of 26,000.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Berko HUH524TA industrial space heater offers electrical heating for small- to medium-size businesses, garages and warehouses with a maximum BTU output of 26,000.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-09-04T20:59:10Z","id":"9rQrhhPmhxRbzmLKPXiRcP","meta":{"title":"Berko HUH524TA Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Berko HUH524TA is an industrial space heater with electric power and a ceiling bracket for installation.
