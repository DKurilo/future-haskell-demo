64-ounce cup and stainless steel blades, the Vitamix 5200 <a href=\"/best-blenders\">blender</a> offers countless ways to help you prepare an assortment of foods. It can easily blend soft ingredients to make pesto, coleslaw or hummus, but it&#39;s equally up to the challenge of grinding coffee beans. We found some weaknesses when testing this blender – other units were better at getting the soup to higher temperatures and it was not great at crushing ice – but this is a fine choice for most tasks and it earned its spot in our top ten. If you want to use your blender for frozen drinks, check out the <a href=\"/nutri-ninja-review\">Nutri Ninja Duo</a>.","This blender tested well when we tried a number of recipes. When it came to making berry smoothies, it was close to tops in its consistency and quality. When we tested an almond butter recipe, it did a fine job. The result was a nut butter that was smooth, lump-free and delicious, which is not always what you get with inferior blenders.","Our soup-making testing involved creating a tomato soup, and the Vitamix 5200 did wonderfully well. The resulting soup was warm and smooth, exactly the way we hoped it would be. The temperature was 140 degrees Fahrenheit, which was a little lower than the top-ranked products. However, the soup was still hot enough to warm us up on a cold day.","This forceful blender uses 1,380 watts to power through a variety of tasks. That is a lot of power to puree, grind, mix, blend or crush different foods. But other blenders offer even more power and make less noise.","It comes with a 64-ounce jar and the motor works on 10 different speed settings. However, you do not get a single-serve jar with this blender so you have to clean out the big pitcher after any use.","One thing you might want to check is the space in your kitchen to make sure you have a place to store this handsome but sizeable blender. It is 20.5 inches tall, which is higher than some standard kitchen cupboards. You might need to find a home for this on your kitchen countertop or somewhere else. It is 7.25 inches wide and 8.75 inches deep.","This powerful blender is one of the higher-end models, so it is disappointing that it is not safe to clean in the dishwasher. You will need to hand wash it. You can wash the blender with soapy water and use a bottlebrush to clean the blades to make things easier, but it would be even better if it could go into the dishwasher safely.","This blender also does not have flat controls that lie flush against the device, which would give you a smooth surface to clean. Instead, the controls stick out and you will have to clean around them with a soft cloth or sponge, and maybe even a toothpick at times.","You get a useful cord wrap feature that can keep the cord out of the way and keep your kitchen counter free of clutter. This cord extends up to 6 feet in length, so having the ability to wrap it is useful.","You get an abundance of customer service support when you purchase this blender. You get a seven-year warranty for the unit itself and another of the same duration for the motor, which is quite good coverage. If you want, you can pay for an extra three years of protection as well. If you have problems, you can call the company or email support staff with your concerns. You do not have access to live chat, unfortunately."]},"id":"a49a45b5-7292-4d15-9106-8c2177d49991","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"689fdbc8-e2ee-49a3-896c-0d03428d8861","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Vitamix 5200 is rather tall and may not fit under your cupboards, is not dishwasher safe and does not come with a single-serve jar.
