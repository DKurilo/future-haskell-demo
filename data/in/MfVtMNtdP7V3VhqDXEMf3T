The website claims they have resold more than $140 billion in unwanted gift cards at a discount for consumers. They carry gift cards from more than 1,100 retailers. While this can vary day to day, we did notice in general, the selection did appear to be larger than with many competing websites. Just a cursory glance gave us cards from Nordstrom, 7-Eleven and AMC Movie Theaters. However, in our tests we looked for cards at Walmart, Target and Amazon and CardCash failed to have any Amazon cards in stock, therefore it earned a C+.","What makes this website a great value is the money you’ll get back when selling any unwanted gift cards. CardCash promises up to 92 percent of the card’s full value, though this will vary depending on the card as well as its supply and demand. To sell your card, all you do is select the merchant, enter the balance and click &#34;get offer.&#34; It&#39;s really that easy. If you opt for a payout you can choose between getting your money via direct deposit, PayPal or a check in the mail. Payout only takes 1-2 business days, which is a lot faster than most of the websites we reviewed.","You can also opt to trade your unwanted gift card for one from another retailer, in which case you can expect to get up to 11 percent more than you would if you just sold it. In our tests we got a $17.80 payout offer on a $20 Walmart card, but keep in mind you might get a different offer depending on whether CardCash has a lot of that particular card available and if people are searching for it frequently. You most likely won’t be asked to mail in a gift card, but there’s a chance you might. Make sure to read the fine print on any transaction.","Buying cards is also very easy. Once you select the retailer, all available cards are listed with their dollar amount, and how much of a discount they&#39;re available at. For instance, you&#39;ll see up-front that a $200 gift card listed as available for $136 is a whopping 32 percent off. You don&#39;t have to do the math yourself! And yes, that is a real example of one of the steep discounts we saw on the website. The gift card format is also shown prominently on the web page, so you know if you’re getting an electronic card or will have to wait for one to arrive in the mail. If you buy a physical gift card, shipping can take up to 7 business days, which is a bit faster than most of the websites we tested.","Not every gift card exchange is perfect though. It was annoying once we realized retailers listed on CardCash home page didn’t actually have any gift cards available for purchase. While we don’t think the Better Business Bureau has the last word when it comes to where you should shop, CardCash was flagged by the consumer watchdog group in 2016 for selling cards that expired 45 days after purchase. Per the complaint, CardCash has since begun publicizing the fact that the cards they sell are only guaranteed within 45 days of purchase. In October 2017, the BBB still felt the steps that had been implemented hadn&#39;t eliminated the problem. Still, even with that bump in the road, CardCash holds a B- rating with the group. CardCash does only guarantee their cards for 45 days, but the website notes legislation from the mid-2000s means gift cards shouldn’t have expiration dates anymore, so don’t worry. The website also won’t buy any cards from sellers if they have an expiration date. The 45-day guarantee isn’t as good as some websites like <a href=\"/cardpool-review\">Cardpool</a> and <a href=\"/raise-review\">Raise</a> which guarantee their cards for an entire year, but it’s also better than websites that don’t offer any kind of guarantee.","CardCash also has a free mobile app, which is great if you don’t want to be tied to a desktop or laptop. The mobile option is nice, but what’s more important is this website’s transparency and lack of fees. You won’t be charged anything for shipping and since the payout time is so fast, this gift card exchange website is really a great value."]},"id":"17488680-a401-4b7f-9719-21646012ecc5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55593","url":"/cardcash-com-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-12-18T15:58:13Z","datePublished":"2012-12-18T15:58:13Z","name":"CardCash.com","synopsis":"Founded in 2009, CardCash has a history of offering great deals on gift cards.
