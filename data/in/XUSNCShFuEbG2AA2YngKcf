The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><em><a href=\"/best-video-editing-software\">Video Editing Software</a>Â here</em><em>.</em>","With Roxio MyDVD Video Lab HD, you can choose from hundreds of transitions and effects. This video editing software uses a lot of computer resources, but it only provides five tracks where you can add video, audio and special effects clips. It can create 3D movies and supports many common file formats.","MyDVD Video Lab has 245 transitions, 115 effects, 58 text options and 37 picture-in-picture (PiP) objects. You can import your own music, voiceovers and sound effects. You can also download audio from Roxio for an additional fee.","This application only has five tracks for adding video clips, overlays, audio tracks, effects and text. We would have liked to see a larger number of tracks because that would give you more flexibility as you edit videos. Five tracks can be enough to create simple movies, but experienced video editors might be frustrated with the limitations.","This video editing application has standard features such as a storyboard and timeline mode. You can change the aspect ratio and trim scenes. Roxio MyDVD Video Lab HD can stabilize shaky video footage. Additionally, it can adjust the color in your movies. One noticeable feature this video editing software lacks is green-screen editing capabilities.","This movie editing software can import files from your hard drive or capture video from a device. You can save your final movie on a DVD or Blu-ray Disc. You can also create 3D movies. Some of the file formats Roxio MyDVD Video Lab HD supports for exporting videos to include AVCHD, MPG4, FLV, AVC, AVI, DivX, DVAVI, AAC and WMV. The file output you use will determine the quality of the finished product. It will also influence how long it takes to save the file. We noticed that this video editor uses quite a bit of your computer&#39;s resources, especially if you&#39;re working on a complex project or in HD.","Similar to other video editing software, this application allows you to drag and drop files, transitions, effects and other clips onto the timeline or storyboard, adjusting when the clips and effects start and stop. The PiP objects are also easily adjustable.","Roxio offers support for this video editor within the application itself. If you still have questions, you can contact the manufacturer via a support ticket. Roxio also provides a user forum."]},"id":"10eb2d5f-7bf7-4a14-b992-f6cebadeea73","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fd76ce66-8d89-4d28-8d55-a3b275f2e661","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While this video editing software offers many good tools, it is missing a few features that are common in similar products.
