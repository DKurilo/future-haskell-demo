This test involved listening to it with car speakers to evaluate how the bass fit in the mix. I also disconnected the car speakers to isolate the bass and listen for distortions and clipping. This sub outperformed the other under-seat car subwoofers, except for the JBL BassPro SL. That said, it's worth noting that the BassPro SL is identical to the Infinity BassLink SM, aside from a few aesthetic details and the price. They're even designed and manufactured by the same company, Harman, so it's not surprising for these powered subwoofers to perform similarly.   <br />\n   <br />\nThe bass size earned a B+ grade. I tested this first by finding the sweet spot where the subwoofer performed at its biggest point without distortion or clipping. Then I measured the volume with a decibel meter. I also walked away from the subwoofer until I couldn't feel the bass anymore. While it certainly wasn't bigger than the 12-inch powered subs I tested, it was significantly bigger than the other under-seat car speakers. With it installed under your seat, you feel the punch of the bass rattling your bones more than a subwoofer in a trunk. The B+ grade is more comparable to the A+ grade of the bigger subwoofers.   <br />\n   <br />\nI don't like the silver casing. Every under-seat subwoofer I reviewed is black, and for good reason â€“ black blends into the shadows under your seat, making it less of a target for theft. Even if your seat covers the subwoofer, it's likely the edges are still visible. With a silver casing, it stands out. And as somebody who has had his prized subwoofer stolen before, I don't like that this one is easy to see. That said, this is clearly a matter of preference. If you're concerned with the silver drawing too much attention, the JBL BassPro SL is identical in terms of specifications and performance, but the black enclosure is less conspicuous.","<a href=\"/infinity-basslink-sm-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"330c041f-93af-4634-8f51-d2b5bc94169f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Booming Performance"},"id":"1573df2f-f852-4bed-a620-a1e4c52a2d7b","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/23CZVwVU4vjo3phpJRhThJ.jpg","link":{"href":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/home/auto/best-car-subwoofers/jbl-gt-basspro12-review/ ","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/Q/Q/788930/original/Car-Subwoofers-JBL-GT-BassPro12-001.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/23CZVwVU4vjo3phpJRhThJ.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"23CZVwVU4vjo3phpJRhThJ","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/23CZVwVU4vjo3phpJRhThJ.jpg","alt":"JBL GT-BassPro12 "},"id":"3b7c598e-9048-43a4-9327-49caed89fe18","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"JBL GT-BassPro12 \",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":88,"url":"/jbl-gt-basspro12-review","name":"JBL GT-BassPro12","id":"667"},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/home/auto/best-car-subwoofers/jbl-gt-basspro12-review/ \">JBL GT-BassPro12 </a>","pros":["Best sub for booming bass"],"cons":["Very expensive"]},"id":"96f3f24e-fa20-4af9-aabb-65c9611b7657","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["","The JBL GT-BassPro12 has the most intimidating design of the subwoofers I tested.

The bass isn't as accurate and tight as subwoofers with a closed or sealed enclosure, but lots of people prefer that boom.

I&#39;ve spent between 40 and 120 hours reviewing component subwoofers each year. However, I shifted the focus this year from component subs to powered subs. The reason is simple. Purchasing a component subwoofer means you must also purchase an amplifier and an enclosure.","By focusing on powered subs, I&#39;ve simplified the purchasing decision, accounting for the amplifier and enclosure decisions as well. These subs are practically plug-and-play devices. You don&#39;t have to fret over matching the power handling specifications of a component subwoofer with a compatible amplifier. Nor do you have to worry about matching up the wire gauges. Powered subwoofers don&#39;t require an electrical expert to install. That said, hiding power and audio cables or removing dash consoles to access stereo ports can be difficult if you don&#39;t have experience, so you may want to consider a professional installation.","<strong>How Much Do Car Subwoofers Cost?</strong>","The powered car subwoofers in this review cost between $112 and $300. If you search for car subwoofers on sites like Amazon or Crutchfield, you can find subwoofers for as low as $20. However, these are just the speaker part of the sub. To add bass to your mix, buy an enclosure and an amplifier. When you consider the cost of an enclosure, amplifier, wiring and a professional installation, a car subwoofer can easily run over $500. Therefore, a powered subwoofer, like the ones I reviewed, are both the easiest to install and the most affordable option.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","To test and compare the powered subwoofers, I set up an area in our audio lab where I could easily connect and disconnect each subwoofer for an easy apples-to-apples comparison of performance. Each subwoofer was powered by a DC converter, simulating a car&#39;s battery, and was connected to the same <a href=\"/best-car-audio-systems\">car stereo</a> and <a href=\"/best-car-speakers\">car speakers</a>."]},"id":"8021db81-7336-4a16-9b86-a68b4eb9fa10","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/qNZU2bYgLAmMoPx4KZXhYY.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Using a playlist of songs that I recorded and mixed, I evaluated the performance of the subwoofer within the context of the overall mix.

This is the simplest of car audio systems. Most modern cars come with four speakers. The best way to improve a factory-installed audio system is to add a subwoofer. In addition to making the music feel bigger by filling out the mix, your car&#39;s speakers perform more accurately because they don&#39;t have to produce all the audio.","When to Choose a Passive Component Subwoofer<br/>Powered subwoofers like the ones I reviewed are the easiest and most affordable way to add a subwoofer to your car&#39;s audio. However, powered car subwoofers are limited in terms of control and expandability.","A passive component subwoofer is the other option. These subs are simply the speaker and nothing else. They require at least two additional purchases â€“ an amplifier and an enclosure. And the quality and price of component subwoofers varies, from as low as $30 to as high as $10,000 (<a href=\"https://www.mtx.com/jackhammer-car-audio-subwoofer\">MTX JackHammer TS9924-22</a>, for example).","Since you must buy the amplifier and enclosure, you have more control over how the woofer performs. You can buy an amplifier to power the car speakers as well as the subwoofer or to expand the system however you want. You can build your own enclosure to fit both your car and to shape the bass to your preferences.","Enclosures: Sealed or Ported<br/>According to Crutchfield&#39;s Buck Pomerantz, the secret to a subwoofer&#39;s performance &#34;lies in the type of subwoofer box you use.&#34; While sizes and shapes of enclosures vary and can have some influence over performance since the enclosure needs to be tuned to the frequency of the subwoofer, the biggest influence over performance is whether the enclosure is sealed or ported.","A sealed enclosure is closed off, allowing no air to move out of the box. This stabilizes the woofer as it pushes against the pressure of the atmosphere to create the low frequencies. This stabilization is designed to create an accurate bass sound that Pomerantz describes as &#34;tight.&#34; However, since the woofer is stabilized against the atmosphere, it requires more power to drive a subwoofer in a sealed enclosure.","Conversely, a ported enclosure has a hole in the box. This hole equalizes the pressure inside the box with the atmosphere, making the woofer easier to move. As such, a ported enclosure doesn&#39;t require as much power to drive as a sealed enclosure. You can reach much higher volumes with much lower power. And since air moves freely in and out of the enclosure, it has an aggressive, less accurate sound Pomerantz describes as &#34;boomy.&#34;","Neither type of performance is necessarily better. It depends on your personal preferences. Pomerantz breaks the two enclosures into two camps of people: those who want to &#34;hear bass, not thunder&#34; and those who want &#34;more punch and reverberance&#34; in the beat. Most of the subwoofers I tested fall into the &#34;hear bass, not thunder&#34; camp, but a few of the powered subs come in ported enclosures and fit into the boomy category. As such, I evaluated their performance from this perspective.","Professional or DIY Installation<br/>When you purchase audio equipment from an online retailer, you avoid the car audio shop&#39;s installation fee. This savings means you are responsible at installing the equipment yourself. For some products, it&#39;s easy. For most cars, speakers are easy to swap out on your own with little more than a screwdriver. Some retailers, like Crutchfield, even include DIY instructions specific to your vehicle. But should you install it yourself?","In an interview with Steve Stern, president of the <a href=\"https://mecacaraudio.com/\">Mobile Electronics Competition Association</a>, he argued for a professional installation. He explained, a &#34;tight install can work to bring out the best in even the most basic, inexpensive equipment.&#34; For him, it&#39;s worth the cost of the installation to make sure everything is wired correctly so the speakers get the cleanest signal possible. This requires expert knowledge in matching wire gauge impedance and cord length to the impedance of the speakers and stereo to get the cleanest audio signal.","With powered subwoofers, the installation is far simpler than trying to add a passive subwoofer, enclosure and amplifier because it&#39;s all one unit. You simply connect the subwoofer&#39;s speakers to the pre-outs of the stereo and connect the power and ground cables to the battery or fuse box. Of course, even this level of simplicity is more complicated than it seems. Every vehicle is different, but accessing the back of a stereo and power supply often means removing door panels, ceiling panels, consoles and dashes. Unless you&#39;re confident you can put things back together, a professional installation is worth a consideration.","<strong>What Size Subwoofer is Best for Your Car?</strong>","Choosing the right car subwoofer for your personal tastes and your car is important to get the sound you want. As such, you need to know why you would or wouldnâ€™t choose a certain size subwoofer.","8-inch<br/>This is your best choice if your car has limited space or if your car came with subwoofers installed. These subs donâ€™t require much power and many can be powered by your carâ€™s stereo or a small amplifier. However, this size is the bare minimum for improving bass performance. The wooferâ€™s size and performance is closer to a standard 6x9-inch car speakerÂ â€“ itâ€™s capable of improving bass, particularly the high bass, but isnâ€™t designed for the booming bass most people think of when buying subwoofers.","10-inch<br/>This size is ideal for entry-level car audio enthusiasts because they often fit into 8-inch enclosures without much modification, making installations easy. The bass performance is enough to provide some boom, but itâ€™s not ideal for bass-heavy music like hip-hop or dance music.","12-inch<br/>This is the most popular size for car audio enthusiasts because it&#39;s capable of delivering impressive bass. However, upgrading to a 12-inch subwoofer requires some commitment. The installation is more difficult because it requires more power than a smaller subwoofer, and it isnâ€™t likely to fit into a factory-installed subwoofer location. In most cases, this size subwoofer requires an enclosure and an amplifier to drive it.","15-inch<br/>If you want to impress everyone you drive past on the street, a 15-inch subwoofer is your best option. Since these subs have the largest surface area, they move the most air, which means the bass is felt from much further away. However, because it has to move so much air, it needs to be paired with a powerful amplifier and a large enclosure. So, itâ€™s not typically recommended for smaller vehicles, unless you&#39;re okay with sacrificing trunk space.Â Â ","Itâ€™s also worth keeping in mind the bigger a subwoofer is, the easier it is for the bass to take over the audio. Learning how to balance the subwoofer performance with your car speakers is key to getting the best audio possible."]},"id":"40a47ac8-b7c0-4da2-8f6e-8bcc3857aa81","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"a3cb4b14-57fb-4cd6-9e64-d0535c73040c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/rockford-fosgate-p300-review\">Rockford Fosgate P300</a>","<a href=\"/pioneer-ts-wx1210a-review\">Pioneer TS-WX1210A</a>","<a href=\"/jbl-gt-basspro12-review\">JBL GT-BassPro12</a>","<a href=\"/infinity-basslink-sm-review\">Infinity BassLink SM</a>","<a href=\"/kenwood-ksc-sw11-review\">Kenwood KSC-SW11</a>","<a href=\"/mtx-audio-rtp8a-review\">MTX Audio RTP8A</a>","<a href=\"/rockford-fosgate-ps-8-review\">Rockford Fosgate PS-8</a>","<a href=\"/kicker-hideaway-review\">Kicker Hideaway</a>","<a href=\"/jbl-basspro-sl-review\">JBL BassPro SL</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"f1be52cf-fdfd-4d85-986d-da6d0bcf5f6d","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_67","url":"/best-car-subwoofers","authors":[{"email":"jeph.preece@futurenet.com","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T16:36:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T16:36:00Z","name":"Best Car Subwoofers of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best powered subwoofers for your car, ranked by their audio quality, power handling and enclosure size.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best powered subwoofers for your car, ranked by their audio quality, power handling and enclosure size.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-05T23:09:52Z","id":"PYPcCv5emDyPGRYMdNHreh","meta":{"title":"Best Car Subwoofers of 2019 -
