You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Verbal Advantage uses a systematic approach and short lessons to improve your vocabulary and help increase your confidence in expressing yourself in speech and in writing. This vocabulary building software consists of 24 audio CDs and two CD-ROM guidebooks. The program encompasses 3,500 vocabulary words you learn through a process of repetition and progression as you assimilate the words into your vocabulary.","This <a href=\"/best-vocabulary-software\">vocabulary builder</a> breaks your studies down into digestible segments with lessons of 10 words each that take 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Each lesson has a quiz that tests how well you have internalized the vocabulary words. This vocabulary building software uses antonyms, synonyms and sample sentences to clearly define each word so you will not be confused or make a mistake when hearing or using the words in conversation.","The philosophy behind this program is a bit different from many of the other programs in our review. For example, unlike <a href=\"/vocab1-review\">Vocab1</a>, this software does not improve your vocabulary with such learning tools as flash cards and games. Instead, this is designed to help you improve vocabulary on the go since you can download the audio onto your MP3 player or iPod and plug in it anywhere.","Unfortunately, this program lacks the kinds of content that would help you build your vocabulary to prepare for college entrance exams. If you or someone in your household needs that, Verbal Advantage does have a separate Verbal Advantage Student Edition that is designed for high school and junior high students.","If you run into any problems with this vocabulary software, you can reach the company by contacting it either through email or phone, and the company representatives are helpful and courteous. If it turns out you are completely unsatisfied, you can make use of a 30-day money back guarantee.","Verbal Advantage takes some 3,500 words and presents them in such a way that quite a number of them can be integrated into your everyday vocabulary in short order. This learning tool is designed to be portable so you can listen to it on the way to work in the car or while taking the dog for a walk. It doesn’t use flash cards or games but makes the content accessible in different but effective ways."]},"id":"31b7ae8c-6e16-4bff-bea0-edbe0a352533","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58489","url":"/verbal-advantage-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"aaron-mccarter","url":"/author/aaron-mccarter","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Aaron McCarter","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EMPGWr9T6iJCifmMZAJCYY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-21T00:53:00Z","datePublished":"2013-12-21T00:53:00Z","name":"Verbal Advantage","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":84,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-12-21T00:53:00Z","id":"nfYoTZZ7eZKBggdZ4BDGH5","meta":{"title":"Verbal Advantage Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Verbal Advantage presents 3,500 vocabulary words taught through repetition and progression in study sessions that last as little as 10-15 minutes."},"products":[{"slug":"verbal-advantage","url":"/product/verbal-advantage","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:48:55Z","name":"Verbal Advantage","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:48:55Z","id":"jgxp5LxDRhwNG3ncBhaYWG","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T23:48:56Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/SMtjTgGcVnKtfpid7SowcL.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:48:55Z","mimeType":"","name":"58461-verbal-advantage-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/58461-verbal-advantage-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:48:55Z","id":"SMtjTgGcVnKtfpid7SowcL","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SMtjTgGcVnKtfpid7SowcL.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Verbal Advantage Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Verbal Advantage presents 3,500 vocabulary words taught through repetition and progression in study sessions that last as little as 10-15 minutes."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/SMtjTgGcVnKtfpid7SowcL.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:48:55Z","mimeType":"","name":"58461-verbal-advantage-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/58461-verbal-advantage-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:48:55Z","id":"SMtjTgGcVnKtfpid7SowcL","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SMtjTgGcVnKtfpid7SowcL.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Verbal Advantage Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Verbal Advantage presents 3,500 vocabulary words taught through repetition and progression in study sessions that last as little as 10-15 minutes."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/software/education/best-vocabulary-software/verbal-advantage-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:48:55Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:48:55Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"learning-software","url":"/hobbies/learning-software","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:48:55Z","name":"Learning Software","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:48:55Z","id":"4rDnxPcDkoTmubv3QyJNG4","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
