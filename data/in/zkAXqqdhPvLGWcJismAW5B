is a competitive <a href=\"/best-solar-companies\">solar company</a> with good guarantees, warranties and monitoring service. It’s easy to find answers to your questions on the company&#39;s extensive FAQs page and through its representatives. While the company does not install your solar panels itself, it works with trusted partners to get the work done. Sunnova does business in 17 states, including Oregon, Colorado, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, Pennsylvania, New York and Hawaii.","You currently cannot go completely off the grid with Sunnova, but it can help lower your dependency on traditional power. The company is currently testing battery systems in select markets, which means is could soon start offering backup storage battery installation.","Sunnova has four different payment plans: EZ Pay PPA, PPA, EZ Own and Lease. The difference between EZ Pay PPA and PPA is that the former has a fixed monthly cost with an annual adjustment based on how much solar power the system produces. The latter agreement&#39;s monthly cost varies depending on how much energy your system produces. It&#39;s good to note that the EZ Pay PPA plan comes with an energy production guarantee and the PPA does not. With either plan, you have the option of owning the energy system after five years, but you are not eligible for tax credits.","The EZ Own option is basically a solar panel loan. You do not need to make a down payment on this plan, but there is a fixed monthly payment until the system is paid off. You are eligible for tax credits when you choose the EZ Own plan. When you opt for Sunnova’s Lease agreement, you pay a fixed monthly rate for the energy system, but you aren’t eligible for tax credits and you don’t own the solar panels.","You don’t have to pay for solar panel repairs since all of Sunnova&#39;s service agreements come with a 25-year maintenance and operations warranty in addition to 24/7 monitoring. This warranty also covers any roof damage caused by the solar panels. All of the company’s agreement plans are transferrable, which means you can pass yours on to the new owner should you sell your home.","When you request a consultation, a Sunnova representative comes out to evaluate your house and create a custom design plan. After you sign the final agreement and before installation can begin, permits and other paperwork need to be approved by your city and utility company.","Sunnova doesn’t actually install the panels – instead, it sends one of its trusted installation partners. These partners go through rigorous testing to make sure Sunnova approves of their installation methods. The utility company needs to set up net meter before your system starts generating power.","Sunnova constantly monitors your system and makes any necessary repairs. You can even monitor the solar panels&#39; productivity by logging in to your account on the company&#39;s website.","The company’s website has an impressive FAQs page where you can find answers to common questions. In fact, the website has more information than most other solar company&#39;s sites. You can contact Sunnova representatives by email and telephone, though we found that calling was more effective than emailing.","Sunnova has comprehensive solar panel warranties and guarantees, which protect your investment. You can choose from four PPA, loan and lease contract options, and because of the variety, it is easy to find one that fits your budget and needs. Most importantly, it’s easy to contact the company, and reps are knowledgeable."]},"id":"7c341586-c42f-4ae8-805b-0843eee15d9f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69383","url":"/sunnova-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-26T13:32:36Z","datePublished":"2017-05-26T13:32:36Z","name":"Sunnova","synopsis":"Sunnova is a competitive solar company with good guarantees, warranties and monitoring service.","review":{"rating":95,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Sunnova is a competitive solar company with good guarantees, warranties and monitoring service.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-05-26T13:32:36Z","id":"zkAXqqdhPvLGWcJismAW5B","meta":{"title":"Sunnova Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Sunnova offers a warranty with all its plans.
