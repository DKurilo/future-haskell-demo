You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Pioneer has put together a strong line of <a href=\"/electronics/home-entertainment/best-blu-ray-players/\">Blu-ray players</a> that it calls the Pioneer Elite Series. The BDP-62FD player from Pioneer is built like a tank (well, more like an A/V receiver) and doesn&#39;t have the small, sleek design and modern features that other Blu-ray players we&#39;ve reviewed have.","The BDP-62FD, as the Elite Series name would suggest, is an elite Blu-ray player when it comes to video-format playability. This 3D Blu-ray player can play an assortment of different video formats, including BD, DVD, DivX, FLV, MP4, AVI, WMV and MKV. There is a USB port conveniently located on the front of the player that you can use to plug in your USB storage devices and play the stored contents with the Blu-ray player.","You can download an app that allows you to control your Blu-ray player with your mobile device. We like the fact that this app is compatible with both Apple and Android devices. You can also use a YouTube app to wireless play YouTube videos on your phone and stream them to your Blu-ray player. This player is not set up for a ton of different apps that you may find on other players, but the BDP-62FD is set up with streaming apps for YouTube, Pandora, Picasa and Netflix.","The BDP-62FD is DLNA certified, which allows you to use your phone as a remote control, and to link the Blu-ray player to a computer or other device that is also DLNA certified to create your own home network. Although this player is wireless ready, you will need to purchase the AS-WL300 wireless adapter separately if you want to enjoy Wi-Fi connectivity.","This elite Blu-ray player is built with the technology to speed up the boot up time and make the picture crisper, such as the inclusion of a QDEO video processor. However, Pioneer seemed to miss out on including some features that you will find on the best Blu-ray players we reviewed, such as 2D to 3D conversion and Ultra 4K resolution upscaling.","The 62FD does come with dual HDMI ports that support both audio and video data. This can be useful if you need to hook your Blu-ray player up to an older A/V receiver that may not support 3D audio data. Included in the purchase of the Pioneer Elite Series player is a two-year warranty, which is the best warranty among all the Blu-ray players we reviewed."]},"id":"41faba63-3a01-4a48-aaf5-b0f328b84c3e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"65ce30fe-55f9-42ef-bf3c-2f961fb8d6d1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This tank of a Blu-ray player has all the components of an elite Blu-ray player, but it leaves out some cutting-edge technology such as 2D to 3D conversion and Ultra Upscaling that other Blu-ray players we reviewed have."]},"id":"aa95bf02-d4d6-4d1e-88e4-c2ccb535025d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56835","url":"/pioneer-elite-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-knoder","url":"/author/jonathan-knoder","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Jonathan Knoder","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"yRHneGGUztMrGu99zxra6M","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-24T14:32:09Z","datePublished":"2013-06-24T14:32:09Z","name":"Pioneer Elite BDP 62FD","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":76,"verdict":"This player has good components, but there are other Blu-ray players on the market that give you more bang for your buck.","pros":["The Pioneer BDP-62FD can play many different audio and video formats."],"cons":["You have to buy a connector separately for the Wi-Fi to work."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-06-24T14:32:09Z","id":"TBMdzGbKESmTXFuLqaaZXK","meta":{"title":"Pioneer Elite BDP 62FD Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Pioneer BDP-62FD has a QDEO video processor to stream crystal clear picture.
