The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/home/outdoor/best-electric-lawn-mowers/\"><em>Electric Lawnmowers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Black &amp; Decker MM875, or Lawn Hog, is the only mower on our review that features a cord. Though it is inconvenient to weave the mower&#39;s cord around yards with flowerbeds, trees or other obstacles, we think this mower is one of the most valuable electric lawn mowers available.","The Black &amp; Decker Lawn Hog has a 100-foot cord that supplies the electric power to its 12-amp motor, which is more powerful than a few of the battery-powered mowers on our review. It mainly mulches and bags grass, but can side-discharge if you purchase an optional chute.","The MM875 is designed for smaller-than-average yards that do not contain many obstacles the cord can be caught on. An urban or small suburban yard is ideal, but you can use the mower on bigger lawns when you use an extension cord.","This corded electric mower is very light when compared to the other battery mowers we reviewed. The MM875 is only 52 pounds, making it by far the lightest mower with a 19-inch deck. This combination of being lightweight, yet having a wide cutting path makes the MM875 easy to use, and this mower is designed to reduce the amount of time and effort you spend mowing.","To enter mulching mode, make sure the bag is not attached to the mower and insert the mulching plug. In mulching mode, the MM875&#39;s blade spins with the purpose of cutting the grass clippings multiple times before they return to the lawn. The MM875 may be the most effective mulcher we reviewed, since it can stay in this mode for an unlimited amount of time. The mulching mowers that contain a battery are capable of mulching for only a half-hour or so.","One of the few things limiting the MM875 from being a contender for the top spot on our review of electric lawn mowers is that attached cord. The inconvenience a corded mower would pose for you depends on your yard type and personal preferences. Having to mow around a cord really is a hassle, when you consider the abilities of some of the top cordless mowers.","This Black &amp; Decker electric lawn mower is made from a durable polymer material. The mower&#39;s deck does not have to house a battery, resulting in a lower overall weight. Since a battery is prone to wear out after two or three years of use, this corded mower will save you money when you never need to buy an expensive replacement battery.","Black &amp; Decker offers a two-year warranty on the MM875. They have service centers available across the country, and an online locator application to find the one closest to you. You can also find FAQs, contact information and the MM875&#39;s manual on Black &amp; Decker&#39;s website."]},"id":"d9f8cbff-baac-415f-a446-1642f9083d55","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5183e07a-e40a-4b7f-852c-2b8daffd3a33","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are not many electric mowers that can claim they bag and mulch grass better than the MM875.
