Meanwhile, enjoy our review below of DVDFab 9.<br/></em>","In our review of the <a href=\"/best-dvd-ripper-software\">best DVD rippers</a>, DVDFab proved itself to be a solid choice. It has a well-designed and intuitive interface, built-in copy protection removal and it creates a high quality copy of your DVD movies. However, it falters a bit when it comes to copy times, and you&#39;ll have to make an additional purchase if you want to rip Blu-ray discs.","DVDFab has a very modern look and feel. The most recent release of the software, DVDFab 9, has updated its interface and workflow from previous iterations. The result is a piece of software that feels modern, functional and is filled with useful features. Most users will get the hang of DVDFab immediately. Some may experience a bit of a learning curve, but almost all will be able to master the application within a few rips.","One of the most important tools in any DVD ripper program is the ability to remove the copy protection found on commercial discs. The fact that the decryption tools are built into the software is a huge boon for DVDFab because it means you don’t have to download a third-party application to unlock the movies on your DVDs. The best part of DVDFab’s decrypter is its automatic nature: you don’t have to take any action to use it. This adds to the application’s intuitive usability, which is arguably its strongest feature.","When you’re ready to rip a movie with DVDFab, you have several options. You can choose to only rip the main movie to your hard drive, while leaving things like special features, trailers and other superfluous extras on the disc. You can also copy the disc&#39;s complete contents to your computer, or pick and choose what does and does not get transferred.","The time it takes to copy a movie using DVDFab is a little disappointing. In our tests, a full rip of a movie took about an hour to complete. While this is by no means the longest time we’ve experienced, other applications can make a copy of the same movie in about half that time.","DVDFab also comes with a great deal of conversion and burning tools. They allow you to take your DVD movies and watch them on a number of devices, including computers, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles and more. If you want to watch a movie on a different device, there&#39;s a high probability that DVDFab can convert your DVD files into a compatible format."]},"id":"2f8579ba-d8b6-466f-abca-28f262ea4981","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5d375e7a-463d-4417-a995-dffa07ee8663","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At the end of the day, DVDFab is an excellent piece of DVD ripper software.
