Although there are a few gaming tablets on the market, the Wikipad is extremely affordable and comes with a detachable controller dock, giving you full control of your games. Unfortunately, it also has a terrible battery life, averaging between three and six hours on a single charge. It has a small handful of interesting games, but most are disappointing. The Wikipad has huge potential, but unless it has the games you want, you should look at one of the other mobile gaming options.","The Wikipad has some interesting features. On its 7-inch HD touchscreen, games and movies are beautiful. However, some of its components are less impressive, such as its 1 GiB RAM and Tegra 3 processor. It&#39;s good for most games, but as tablet gaming grows, the Wikipad will not be able to keep up with the new games.","Until the Tegra 4 becomes standard in tablets, though, the Wikipad will be able to keep up with most tablets, and it offers one thing that most tablets don&#39;t: a controller dock. By sliding the tablet into the controller dock, you can play games with a full range of buttons and controls, making this a great gaming tablet. Of the many Android games available, many natively support the Wikipad&#39;s controller dock, and most others allow you to map the touch controls to the controller.","While the controller is certainly appealing, there are very few games worth playing. Most are either ports or shovelware – low-budget clones of popular games. However, if you want to play a tablet game like &#34;Blood &amp; Glory,&#34; you get a far better experience with the Wikipad&#39;s controller dock.","The Wikipad can get up to eight hours out of its battery, but that&#39;s with minimal gaming and without using the controller dock. In fact, even if you put the handheld game console in standby, the controller dock drains the battery. Usually, the battery only lasts between three and six hours."]},"id":"4e0dd3d6-5f5a-408b-8ecc-1df17bae109e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c6daff5c-f8c7-4927-b12d-b60f5d9173c1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Wikipad is a gaming tablet with some interesting ideas.
