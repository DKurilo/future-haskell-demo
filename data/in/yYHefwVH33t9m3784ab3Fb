The market is definitely a leaner and meaner beast than it was even a few years ago. In order to secure funds, more and more businesses are turning to the practice of using cash advances as a viable means of accessing much needed capital. In this kind of business world, the more you learn about business cash advance options and credit card processing basics, the better. Below are a few key terms and their definitions to help you get a better grasp of the insider lingo you might encounter when dealing with business cash advance options and <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a> basics.","<strong>Merchant Cash Advance</strong> - While not strictly a loan, a business cash advance is very similar. How it works is that a small business promises a percentage of its sales over time in order to secure a large cash payment up front. For example, let&#39;s say that you, a small business owner, need to buy $30,000 worth of product. In order to secure a merchant cash advance, you would go to a bank or another business that specializes in that kind of transaction and decide on a rate to be paid back out of your future sales. For a quick cash infusion of $30,000, you might be asked to pay back $36,000. Of course, that s just an example. Rates can vary quite a bit from provider to provider, and many factors are taken into consideration. However, cash advances have a much higher approval rate and are much less complicated than taking out a business loan.","<strong>Cash Advance Provider</strong> - This is the person or institution that fronts the money for your cash advance. Sometimes businesses specialize in merchant cash advance transactions, but usually larger banks are the organizations that deal with these kinds of transactions.","<strong>Advance Amount</strong> - This is how much money the merchant cash advance provider will provide to your business.","<strong>Daily Retrieval Rate</strong> - Normally, cash advances aren t collected all at one time. A daily retrieval rate is how much revenue is collected from credit cards on a daily basis in order to pay back the advance. Normally, this amount is spread out over one year.","<strong>Credit Card Processor</strong> - This is a third-party merchant provider that deals with the complicated task of processing credit card transactions between merchants, merchant account providers and credit card companies.","<strong>Acceptor</strong> - Simply put, an acceptor is a business that has been qualified to accept debit or credit cards as a form of payment.","<strong>Batch</strong> - A batch is the total number and amount of approved credit card transactions in a merchant s system waiting to be finalized and processed.","<strong>Processor</strong> - Processors do the heavy lifting when it comes to credit card processing. When you swipe your card on a credit card processing machine, a processor s job is to send an authorization request to your bank or credit card account. Once it receives authorization, it arranges for the funds to be transferred to the merchant."]},"id":"d7eca5dd-54be-4f41-bc0b-b7adb307967c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5586","url":"/a-crash-course-in-cash-advances-and-credit-card-processing","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-poole","url":"/author/jonathan-poole","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jonathan Poole","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"y7WapaZTtRrsUwd8C9BWZ3","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-03-14T21:38:24Z","datePublished":"2011-03-14T21:38:24Z","name":"A Crash Course in Cash Advances and Credit Card Processing","synopsis":"In today’s economy, securing credit for a small business can be a tricky process.
