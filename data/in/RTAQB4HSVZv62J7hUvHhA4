With VoIP technology, you can get more international talk time for less money, which makes these types of services great if you spend a lot of time on the phone with people in different countries – whether your needs are personal or more business oriented.","In addition to the 30 hours we spent researching, making international calls, asking customer service representatives setup questions and evaluating the pros and cons of various features and service specifications, our team has years of experience with VoIPs, making international phone calls and posting our opinions on the internet. We want to help you and your business thrive and grow without unnecessarily expensive international calls, and our expertise can help you find the best international call service.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","First, we researched the best options for international call services and narrowed down our selections to voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services, which transmit real-time communications via the internet. We chose VoIP because it&#39;s more affordable and flexible than traditional landlines or mobile contracts. Instead of charging flat monthly rates, landline and mobile services often use per-minute rates, which add up quickly. Then, we scoped out the options and picked the most promising 10. We reached out to each service and arranged a trial period to perform a few tests.","We designed our tests to mimic usual consumer use; we set up each service and made a bunch of international calls, judging each call for quality and marking instances of dropped calls, sound distortions, feedback, delays and other issues. During our tests, we also evaluated the resources available to aid with setup and troubleshooting, and contacted customer service to gauge the timeliness and helpfulness of the replies. Our hands-on testing, combined with thorough product research, formed the framework for our overall evaluations.","<strong>How Much Does an International Call Service Cost?</strong>","The average monthly rate for an international call service is $20 per month. However, you can lower that price by signing up for a one- or two-year contract instead of paying month to month. In most cases, signing up for a longer contract results in lower monthly payments averaging around $15. Beyond contract terms, it is important to factor in the cost of necessary upgrades or applicable fees. Most of the services we tested do not charge setup fees, but some do. Likewise, most services charge a fee of $50 to $100 if you break your contract term.","<strong>What to Look For</strong>","Call clarity is extremely important for any call plan. Our best picks all have great call quality so you don’t miss out on important information. The next most important thing to consider is budget. Many of these services offer basic plans on a month-to-month basis that allow you to add additional services as your needs expand and change.","As with any phone plan, consider the features you or your business will need and use before you make a decision. Also make sure that the countries you need to call most often are part of your plan. For a business, features like extra lines and conference calling might be beneficial, though you might not care about these if you’re just calling friends or relatives. One feature we found particularly useful is a companion mobile app that allows you to make and receive VoIP calls on the go."]},"id":"acb9f819-5d75-4083-af26-717f9ae90368","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_165","url":"/best-international-call-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-22T21:19:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-22T21:19:00Z","name":"Best International Call Services of 2019","synopsis":"We obtained basic international calling plans from each company and placed calls to different countries, testing for clarity and dropped calls.","review":{},"strapline":"We obtained basic international calling plans from each company and placed calls to different countries, testing for clarity and dropped calls.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-24T18:51:25Z","id":"RTAQB4HSVZv62J7hUvHhA4","meta":{"title":"Best VOIP for Home 2019 - International Calling Services, Plans","description":"We obtained basic international calling plans from each company and placed calls to different countries, testing for clarity and dropped calls."},"products":[{"slug":"phone-power","url":"/product/phone-power","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","name":"Phone Power","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","id":"wECtqRT4RpLKWDDxvNUJR7","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"broadvoice","url":"/product/broadvoice","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","name":"Broadvoice","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","id":"U9j4dBvu3qfpvNN54JRZ5o","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"8-x-8-solutions","url":"/product/8-x-8-solutions","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","name":"8 x 8 Solutions","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","id":"iwahyHaVf9PbCdUkezf5qV","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"voip-com-world-plan-ttr-fallback","url":"/product/voip-com-world-plan-ttr-fallback","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","name":"VOIP.com World Plan-TTR Fallback","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","id":"b2skaJXXRTzPvyruL7MTbA","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"voipo-1200-international","url":"/product/voipo-1200-international","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","name":"VOIPo 1200 International","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","id":"hgnQ5wZTbk2Y7uxRV26Ubc","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/kyR7mZ95obgUXBc6HxTeoG.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-International-Call-Services-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/U/H/791657/original/Hero-International-Call-Services-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","id":"kyR7mZ95obgUXBc6HxTeoG","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kyR7mZ95obgUXBc6HxTeoG.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best International Call Services of 2019","description":"We obtained basic international calling plans from each company and placed calls to different countries, testing for clarity and dropped calls."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/kyR7mZ95obgUXBc6HxTeoG.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-International-Call-Services-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/U/H/791657/original/Hero-International-Call-Services-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","id":"kyR7mZ95obgUXBc6HxTeoG","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kyR7mZ95obgUXBc6HxTeoG.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best International Call Services of 2019","description":"We obtained basic international calling plans from each company and placed calls to different countries, testing for clarity and dropped calls."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"travel-and-auto","url":"/travel-and-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","name":"Travel & Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","id":"HmhJjMTFinoVnKmEwqRGEm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"travel","url":"/travel-and-auto/travel","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","name":"Travel","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:12:06Z","id":"FLnk5ADEegd7rRyAV24owh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
