DVDs are made of hardy materials, but they don t last forever; scratches, drops or metal oxidization can pose a real threat to your movies. To safeguard them against such dangers, many people turn to <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD copy software</a> to make digital copies of their movies, but it inevitably leads to a debate over which is better: <strong>DVD copying vs. cloning</strong>.","Today, the terms are used almost interchangeably, so you may not think that the DVD copying vs. cloning debate is valid, but there is a distinction that is worth knowing if you are looking to make a backup of your DVD collection. Here s what you need to know.","Cloning and copying a DVD are similar in as far as they will both give you a reproduction of the original DVD. Cloning, however, should give you a copy that is 100 percent the same as the original disc. That is, it will be the same format and file size as the source disc. For all intents and purposes, a cloned DVD will be identical to the original.","A copy will look essentially the same as a clone, but its file size may be compressed so that it can fit on a standard DVD. This compression may lead to lower video quality, but that can vary according to the DVD copy software you use. A copy may also be in a different file format than the original and may include a change in resolution to optimize your movie for playback on mobile multimedia devices.","Further complications regarding DVD copying vs. cloning arise when you look at software manufacturers because many like to use the terms in a broader sense. Many applications will clone and copy your DVDs, so thinking of these functions in terms of DVD copying vs. cloning becomes irrelevant when the software you use is capable of both functions.","So, instead of getting too hung up on DVD copying vs. cloning, spend some time examining the features and functionality of the DVD copying software you intend to use to back up your discs. Our DVD Copy Software review is a great place to start. Here, the features of each application are laid out side by side, and in-depth reviews of each product are included to help you choose the best software solution for your needs.","Be sure that you are aware of your legal position when you use this type of software. The issue of DVD copying vs. cloning becomes a little less relevant when you are talking about commercial DVDs with copyright protection, known as CSS encryption. Although software exists for CSS decryption, using it for the purpose of copying commercial DVDs still constitutes copyright infringement as defined by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.","So what s the difference between DVD copying vs. cloning? Cloning is a purer and creates an exact duplicate, but modern copying methods are narrowing the definition between these two terms. Copies are now of a higher quality than they have ever been, so much so that these terms are now being used interchangeably.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"b2276cf3-3f90-4494-9e69-ac3215659ae8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6219","url":"/reproducing-a-dvd-copying-vs-cloning","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-wylie","url":"/author/jonathan-wylie","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jonathan Wylie","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dmpAeXU5XQymRmsWKwDrd8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-07-01T16:52:23Z","datePublished":"2011-07-01T16:52:23Z","name":"Reproducing a DVD: Copying vs. Cloning","synopsis":"If you have invested a significant amount of money in a personal DVD collection, you will eventually start to think about your options for backing up this expensive collection.","review":{},"strapline":"If you have invested a significant amount of money in a personal DVD collection, you will eventually start to think about your options for backing up this expensive collection.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-07-01T16:54:29Z","id":"EDuC23THphhPCrmSEMb9df","meta":{"title":"Reproducing a DVD: Copying vs. Cloning","description":"Wondering about the difference between DVD copying vs. cloning?
