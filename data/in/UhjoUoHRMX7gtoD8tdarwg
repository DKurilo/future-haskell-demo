They&#39;ve been around since 1886, so the company knows a thing or two about the industry. The Camille ceiling fan is one of its latest products, and it&#39;s basically bling for your bedroom. Seriously. It has three dark, wooden blades that rotate around a brushed chrome fixture and a beautiful medallion-type light. The light is a candelabra with a frosted casing. A drum shade with a brushed chrome design surrounds the light. The shade hides the actual light bulbs from view."]},"id":"60671827-82a4-4317-91fc-945b6e3846c2","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/j6odwuZSrKjaXSFuFXuR5L.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Just because these modern ceiling fans are beautiful, that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have anything under the hood. In fact, you&#39;ll find that these ceiling fans with lights are quite energy efficient. When running at the highest speed, the Camille fan can rotate 4661 cubic feet of air per minute. The best part is that while all this air is being rotated, only 55 watts of electricity are being used – if the lights are turned off. If you do need the lights on, the efficiency goes down slightly. Mainly because the candelabra light fixture has three 40–watt bulbs. Even with the light on, Hunter claims that the Camille ceiling fan can save you up to 47 percent on cooling costs.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56721-hunter-camille2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j6odwuZSrKjaXSFuFXuR5L.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"j6odwuZSrKjaXSFuFXuR5L","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j6odwuZSrKjaXSFuFXuR5L.jpg","alt":""},"id":"f6ddd85c-2ebc-4143-99d5-0b085e646310","type":"image"},{"data":{"path":"/UHatvGYXGcrpYjeXymWXYX.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Two different mounting systems are optioned for the Camille ceiling fan. You can&#39;t have the fan flush to the ceiling, but you can install it from a flat or angled ceiling. A 3-inch down rod is included in the package, making the fan 10.15 inches from the ceiling to the bottom of the fan blades. You can buy a 36-inch down rod separately if you have high ceilings. All of Hunter&#39;s down rods are ¾ inches in diameter to ensure that the ceiling fan spins securely without wobbling. The fan blades can be switched to spin clockwise or counter-clockwise, depending on what time of year it is – clockwise for summer and counter-clockwise for winter.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56721-hunter-camille1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UHatvGYXGcrpYjeXymWXYX.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"UHatvGYXGcrpYjeXymWXYX","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UHatvGYXGcrpYjeXymWXYX.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e8dfae25-8f23-4e86-b224-1002e3e53f2a","type":"image"},{"data":{"path":"/bctuT55NknjELrcvR2AjrA.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"We recommend hiring an electrician to install your new Camille ceiling fan, just to be safe.
