If you know you will need a longer cord, consider the <a href=\"/t-fal-review\">T-fal FV4495</a>, which has a 12-foot cord. The D2030Â is also one of the biggest irons, measuring 6.3 x 4.9 x 11.5 inches, as well as the heaviest, at 2.94 pounds. Though it has a digital display, we were disappointed to see that it offers no more features than the standard fabric-temperature dials on most steam irons do.","The D2030 has a built-in water reservoir capacity of 12 ounces, which is quite large, meaning you won&#39;t have to bother with refills as often. The reservoir is transparent and easy to fill. The iron has an intuitive interface, and a tone sounds when the iron has reached the desired temperature. A handy self-cleaning function helps remove impurities from the inner soleplate area, which will extend the life of the product.","If you happen to leave the iron unattended in an upright position for 10 minutes, the device&#39;s built-in safety feature automatically turns it off. However, unlike most other irons on our lineup, this one doesn&#39;t seem to automatically shut off if it is tipped over or left face down. The iron&#39;s body, dials and buttons also stay cool to the touch while it&#39;s on.","The D2030 comes with a two-year warranty from Black &amp; Decker, and it also has a digital copy of the owner&#39;s manual on its website.
