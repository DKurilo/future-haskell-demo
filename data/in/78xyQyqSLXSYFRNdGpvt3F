Product developers and designers use the 3D printing business to generate prototypes and for short-run production.","This service prides itself on turnaround time. The company says it provides the fastest turnaround on custom prototypes, as well as low- to mid-volume part production. The 3D printing company can handle short-run production of more than 10,000 parts. This service often functions as a bridge, so your company can receive the parts it needs now while working to secure an agreement with a large-scale manufacturer for future production.","Proto Labs uses a number of custom 3D printing technologies. It offers three additive manufacturing processes that create products with layers of material. To create small parts with intricate geometries, an ultraviolet laser hardens the surface of liquid resin in a process called stereolithography. For bigger products, a carbon dioxide laser fuses thermoplastic powder into a solid material in a process known as selective laser sintering. And to produce functional metal parts, a third additive manufacturing process known as direct metal laser sintering draws on the surface of atomized metal powder, and in the process welds it into a solid material. Proto Lab’s three additive manufacturing processes are mostly used to create prototypes or small runs of products in the early phases of development. If you need fewer than 50 parts produced, the company completes the custom 3D printing process and ships them in fewer than seven days.","This 3D printing service also produces engineering-grade parts from thermoplastic, liquid silicone rubber or metal materials with its injection molding process. The process can be used to generate up to 10,000 plastic parts and up to 5,000 metal parts in fewer than 15 days. Hundreds of engineering-grade resins can be used to generate plastic injection molded parts. Liquid silicone rubber molding is often used to create seals, gaskets, valves and cables. They have high thermal, chemical and electrical resistances that makes them popular for use in the automotive, medical and food appliance industries. Proto Labs’ metal injection molding process also turns metal powder into small parts.","Proto Labs has become one of the top 3D printing companies for product developers and manufacturers in need of prototypes and short-run productions on a tight timetable. The company also offers 3D printing technologies and materials that have applications for a range of industries."]},"id":"47e7cdef-2368-4e52-a446-60a4cf293654","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66927","url":"/proto-labs-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-16T15:53:58Z","datePublished":"2015-09-16T15:53:58Z","name":"Proto Labs","synopsis":"Proto Labs 3D offers 3D printing services that span from the design phase of development to mid-volume production.
