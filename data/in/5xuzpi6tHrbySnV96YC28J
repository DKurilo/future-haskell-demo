You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Ambient Weather WS-5300 is a complete <a href=\"/best-weather-stations\">weather station</a> that measures temperature, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction. We found this to be one of the most accurate and easy-to-assemble weather stations.","We set up each of the weather stations in the backyard of one of our reviewers. The Ambient Weather was one of the easiest to set up since it requires little assembly. You’ll just need to add batteries to the thermal sensor, located beneath the rain gauge, and connect it to the provided pole. To mount this weather station, use the included U-bolts to connect to a sturdy, well-supported pole. TV antenna poles work best, but we had success on a steel pole dug into the ground. Just make sure it’s mounted at least 5 feet in the air, so you can get accurate wind measurements.","For a week we took temperature readings and compared them to popular and trusted weather forecasters such as Weather Underground and Weather.com. We found this Ambient Weather station to be one of the most accurate. Its morning temperatures were spot on, but it did give slightly inflated readings during the day, but only by a degree or so. One feature it lacks that others, like the <a href=\"/acurite-review\">AcuRite 5-in-1</a>, had is an internal fan to regulate the internal thermometer.","If you choose the Ambient Weather WS-5300, make sure you purchase the complete version that includes the console. The website is a little confusing in this regard. You can purchase consoles separately, but the bundle saves you considerable money.","The console for this station was useful, but not among our favorites. Some small features turned out to be difference makers to us, especially adequate lighting. Ambient Weather’s screen is rather dim, but it’s well organized and easy to set up.","With some consoles we had troubles connecting with the outdoor sensor, but the Ambient Weather found its outdoor sensor immediately. One disadvantage of this system is it only has a 100-foot transmission range, significantly lower than other systems we tested, which usually had a range of 300 feet.","If you’re looking for a complete system that will give you readings for temperature, rain and wind, the Ambient Weather WS-5300 is a good choice. It’s among the most accurate stations we tested and is easy to set up."]},"id":"a99e4541-3299-4361-8153-87336b0533b3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63336","url":"/ambient-weather-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-09T19:45:22Z","datePublished":"2015-03-09T19:45:22Z","name":"Ambient Weather 5300","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":95,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","id":"5xuzpi6tHrbySnV96YC28J","meta":{"title":"Ambient Weather WS-11 Review - Pros and Cons","description":"The Ambient Weather WS-5300 is a complete weather station that measures temperature, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction."},"products":[{"slug":"ambient-weather-5300","url":"/product/ambient-weather-5300","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:13:49Z","name":"Ambient Weather 5300","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:13:49Z","id":"7FZCUVPRXdiE4mjN89Q485","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:13:49Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/SJHA5nfcHoXTHm4gdneCUD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:13:49Z","mimeType":"","name":"b368d0b8c2213f1283c657a921bc1930.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/b368d0b8c2213f1283c657a921bc1930.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:13:49Z","id":"SJHA5nfcHoXTHm4gdneCUD","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SJHA5nfcHoXTHm4gdneCUD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Ambient Weather WS-11 Review - Pros and Cons","description":"The Ambient Weather WS-5300 is a complete weather station that measures temperature, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/SJHA5nfcHoXTHm4gdneCUD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:13:49Z","mimeType":"","name":"b368d0b8c2213f1283c657a921bc1930.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/b368d0b8c2213f1283c657a921bc1930.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:13:49Z","id":"SJHA5nfcHoXTHm4gdneCUD","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SJHA5nfcHoXTHm4gdneCUD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Ambient Weather WS-11 Review - Pros and Cons","description":"The Ambient Weather WS-5300 is a complete weather station that measures temperature, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/science/best-weather-stations/ambient-weather-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:13:49Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:13:49Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
