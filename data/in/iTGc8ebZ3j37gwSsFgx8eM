You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Craftsman 41BS2HBC799 is a gas-powered leaf blower that doesn’t vibrate so much as other leaf blowers in our lineup thanks to its design. In addition, the handle sports a comfortable cushion for you to grasp. These two features reduce the strain on your hands and fingers.","One of the best qualities of the Craftsman is its design. The base of the motor is strong metal and should last over time. In addition, you can get a good vacuuming function from the Craftsman, but you will need to buy an additional leaf bag accessory that is sold separately.","This gas <a href=\"/best-leaf-blowers\">leaf blower</a> has a 27cc full-crank engine that produces good power and a solid air speed of 200 mph. However, this doesn&#39;t carry over into the blowing power, since this leaf blower can blow just a bit over 11 feet, which is a far shorter distance than other blowers can cover.","Like all gas leaf blowers, the Craftsman requires more maintenance than an electric or battery-powered model. You have to pull the cord to start the engine, but it doesn&#39;t require a lot of force. The blower weighs 10 pounds, making it the second heaviest model in our lineup. During use, you can feel a pull from the spinning of the engine, which means you could get weary operating this blower for extended times.","This is a noisy leaf blower that can reach 105 dB while in use. You’d be well advised to use ear protection while clearing your yard with this or any other leaf blower. Craftsman offers a two-year warranty on parts and labor for this model, which is a shorter warranty than you get with the other blowers on our lineup.","You get a comfortable design, powerful motor and considerable durability with the Craftsman 41BS2HBC799 gas leaf blower. It has some potential drawbacks: The air speed doesn’t translate into a focused blowing function, and, with a weight of over 10 pounds, this blower is hard to use over a long period. However, you can get plenty of use out of this leaf blower to keep your yard, driveway, patio and sidewalks looking good."]},"id":"99c4beaa-ecc2-4127-9443-f96c1c89fc2a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56467","url":"/craftsman-leaf-blower-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-22T23:46:31Z","datePublished":"2013-05-22T23:46:31Z","name":"Craftsman 41BS2HBC799","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":73,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-05-22T23:46:31Z","id":"iTGc8ebZ3j37gwSsFgx8eM","meta":{"title":"Craftsman 41BS2HBC799 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Craftsman 41BS2HBC799 is a durable, gas-powered leaf blower.
