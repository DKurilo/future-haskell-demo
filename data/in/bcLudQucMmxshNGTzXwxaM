However, with a small design, limited heating capacity and an electric motor, it is not as efficient as it could be, and is best suited for small garages and warehouses.","An electric motor runs at 240 volts with a maximum of 5,640 watts, allowing you to raise the temperature of a room as much as 75 degrees. A temperature control thermometer allows you to adjust the temperature from 35 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit output, for controlling ambient temperature.","A built-in thermometer with an automatic cut-off ensures this industrial heater runs until the desired temperature is reached. Once the selected temperature is reached, the unit shuts off, but remains on to maintain the temperature as needed. However, you do lose efficiency if you do not have insulation.","The industrial electric heater weighs 20 pounds, making it suitable to carry with you to small construction sites and garages. It also features a wall mount that you can use to attach it up out of the way in a garage or small warehouse.","With only 19,107 BTUs, you can heat nearly 1,000 square feet in a well-insulated building, but considerably less in un-insulated warehouses and garages. A built-in fan offers forced heat for quickly warming small areas, but quickly becomes useless in large areas where it only disperses heat. The fan also kicks on to quickly redistribute heat when someone opens or closes a door.","The durable design includes steel housing with a steel handle, a steel tubular heating element and a steel swivel mount. This allows you to quickly change the direction of the fan to point at the wall, ceiling or the floor if you have it on a mount. The steel tubular heating element helps draw airflow and discharge heat for more efficiency.","A 6-foot electric cord with a molded plug allows you to connect the industrial space heater in more easily. The heater runs on 208-240 volts, so you need a 240-volt outlet, which makes the heater a better fit for commercial buildings.","With an electric motor, forced heat operation and an automatic shutoff, the TPI Corporation HF68TC industrial space heater is suited for small garages, warehouses and offices."]},"id":"cba4f625-f98b-4d09-b49f-b59354ba7dcd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66814","url":"/tpi-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-04T20:58:58Z","datePublished":"2015-09-04T20:58:58Z","name":"TPI HF686TC","synopsis":"The TPI Corporation HF686TC is a forced air industrial space heater that runs on 240-volt electricity, making it suitable as either a portable or in-place heater.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The TPI Corporation HF686TC is a forced air industrial space heater that runs on 240-volt electricity, making it suitable as either a portable or in-place heater.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-09-04T20:58:58Z","id":"bcLudQucMmxshNGTzXwxaM","meta":{"title":"TPI HF686TC Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The TPI HF686TC is a fan-forced industrial space heater with a heating capacity of 19,107 BTUs.
