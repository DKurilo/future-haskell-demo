Pushing around a heavy gas-powered lawn mower while sweating in the hot sun is not many homeowners’ idea of fun. Fortunately, the Homelite UT13110 rechargeable <a href=\"/best-electric-lawn-mowers\">electric lawn mower</a> is lightweight and easy to push, requiring less effort and upkeep than a traditional gas lawn mower.","The Homelite electric mower comes with a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 50 minutes with a full charge and on a manageable grass length. This gives you plenty of time to mow a yard of up to 1/4 acre in size, and possibly more if you maintain your lawn. This cordless lawn mower frees you from the extension cord leash, and its design allows you to charge the battery in the mower or after removing it. This adds flexibility, as many other rechargeable mower batteries have to be removed and placed in a special charger.","The cutting height of the Homelite UT13110 ranges from 1.75 to 4 inches. This is close to the average cutting heights of the best electric lawn mowers, and it can give your lawn a nice, close trim. You can adjust the height of the deck with a single lever, which is an excellent feature that ensures your wheels are all at the correct height. The deck width is a generous 23 inches, allowing you to make fewer passes, so you can finish mowing quickly.","Unfortunately, there is no option to bag your grass with this electric mower, and all grass will be ejected from the side discharge. This can mean more cleanup time, but if you keep your lawn trimmed regularly, the clippings can mulch into the lawn without looking bad.","This cordless electric lawn mower is covered by a two-year limited warranty. If you ever need parts or maintenance, you can locate a service center or order the necessary parts on the Homelite webpage."]},"id":"ce986102-e1d7-4f53-9373-bd0e5feead70","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c96ce1f2-5b4c-40c9-9903-7053b77ef8a0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This lightweight, electric mower is easy to adjust and push, which makes the Homelite UT13110 worth considering.
