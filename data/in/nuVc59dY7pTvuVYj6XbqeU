Unlike the other electric fireplaces we researched, this one features infrared heating to warm your home without drying it out. It also comes with all the convenience and safety features you could want and looks elegant. This attractive fireplace is also surprisingly inexpensive for the number of features it has.","Using infrared heating to produce 5,200 Btu, this <a href=\"/best-electric-fireplaces\">electric fireplace</a> is one of the most powerful appliances that we evaluated. It can heat a 1,000-square-foot room in limited time, and the infrared element helps keep the natural humidity in your home instead of drying it out. Many infrared fireplaces cost more than noninfrared ones, so it is surprising that the Duraflame DFI-5010 is so inexpensive. You can adjust the temperature in increments of 2 degrees between 62 degrees and 82 degrees Fahrenheit, which gives you more options than most other electric fireplacesâ€™ thermostats.","This electric fireplace features a timer function so you can preset times for the heater to turn on and off. The flames can operate without the heater, and they look more realistic than most other electric fireplaces since Duraflame uses a 3D flame effect which makes the logs look like they are on fire both on top and behind the logs. The flames can also be adjusted between five different brightness levels to help you find the perfect ambience for your home. If you&#39;d prefer a wall-mounted fireplace, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/touchstone-review\">Touchstone Onyx</a>.","There are physical buttons on the Duraflame itself, but fortunately, they are hidden from view behind the door so they don&#39;t distract from the appliance. To add even more to your convenience, you can adjust the timer, temperature, flame settings and heat settings using the remote control. As far as safety features go, the fireplace stays cool to the touch anywhere other than the heating vent, so you can feel safe having this on around children and pets. It also features automatic shutoff in case the appliance gets too hot, so you won&#39;t have monitor it at all times.","Duraflame backs this electric fireplace with a one-year warranty, which is standard for this kind of unit. This electric fireplace unit has the widest color selection we have seen with its six different color choices: black, bronze, cinnamon, cream, French gray and pistachio. The design itself is a beautiful mix of rustic elegance that will add an aesthetic touch to your home. You will need to attach the legs onto the electric fireplace when it arrives, but overall assembly is minimal and won&#39;t take very long."]},"id":"80102c09-fbab-40e5-b200-02af64e4835a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69551","url":"/duraflame-dfi-5010-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-07-26T15:23:41Z","datePublished":"2017-07-26T15:23:41Z","name":"Duraflame DFI-5010","synopsis":"The Duraflame is one of the best electric fireplaces we evaluated and is especially good for warming a large room.
