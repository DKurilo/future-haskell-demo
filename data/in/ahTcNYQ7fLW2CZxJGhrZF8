You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Serif PhotoPlus gives you tools to help organize and edit your photos. This <a href=\"/best-photo-manager-software\">photo manager software</a> provides you with a sidebar with How To information to help you get started, as well as clearly labeled tools. You can create an organization system that works for you with the tools Serif PhotoPlus provides.<strong><br/></strong>","You can tag your photos with keywords and add them to albums. Serif PhotoPlus gives examples of folders you can use: Events, Family and Friends, Hobbies, Style and Workflow. You can also rate your photos with one to five stars, depending on how much you like them. This way you can sort your photos to immediately find all of your favorite photos. Another organization option you can use is to flag your photos.","PhotoPlus is compatible with many RAW files, which means you can preserve the natural colors from the digital picture. You can also view the metadata for your photos, which includes your camera settings, the photo&#39;s file name and its organization tags. This software is also non-destructive, meaning that it will not alter your original photos. Additionally, this picture manager software backs up your files.","The best photo management software allows you to perform batch processing, which enables you to select a group of photos and make changes to all of them by simply altering one of the photos in the batch. For instance, let&#39;s say you took a dozen photos of the coastline. Unfortunately, your new camera has a barrel lens and your photos are distorted. In addition to this, all the photos are overexposed. With batch processing, you can correct the lens distortion and exposure on one of the photos. Those adjustments will translate to all the photos in the batch so you don&#39;t have to tweak all your photos individually to achieve the same results.","From Serif PhotoPlus, you can share your photos and videos with clients via email. You can also send them directly to Facebook, Flickr or YouTube. The buttons for sharing your photos aren&#39;t as accessible as they are on other photo manager software we reviewed, but it&#39;s still easier than navigating to the websites, signing in and then adding the photos.","As we said before, the focus of this software is on its editing functions more than on managing your photos. As a result, the editing tools are more accessible than the management tools. The batch-processing tool helps you efficiently make changes to a large number of pictures. Some of the enhancements that you can make include zooming in on images to create specific changes in a small area, reposition your photos using the position guides for added accuracy. You can also add blur and brightness to give your image a different look.","Serif offers several support options. You can find tutorials and manuals on Serif&#39;s website as well as a telephone number, physical address and email addresses."]},"id":"ce333e23-a5d2-4e3f-9bba-c9e85eeb132a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"154b2397-2e49-480b-91a7-a8341ed6042f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["PhotoPlus may be more complicated to use than other photo manager software, but it still has the organization tools you need to effectively manage your photos.
