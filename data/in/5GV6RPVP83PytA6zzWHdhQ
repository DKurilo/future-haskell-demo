It installs updates automatically, and even backs up and restores drivers. And though the <a href=\"/best-driver-update-software\">driver update software</a> didn’t catch all the out-of-date drivers on our test computer, but it has some useful features that make it a decent option.","In our tests, Advanced Driver Updater found just 48 of the 149 outdated drivers installed on our test computer, leaving us to wonder what important drivers it may have missed. Of course, this is a question every product left us with. Even the best performing app, <a href=\"/software/utilities/best-driver-update-software/driver-booster-review/\">Driver Booster</a>, found just 91 of the drivers that needed updates.","You can view each updated driver’s source and version details, which allows you to gauge its trustworthiness. While we’d like for the program to have a faster, more effective scan, we appreciate the wealth of information it provides.","Sometimes a driver update ends up not being a good fit and prevents your computer from running optimally. With Advanced Driver Updater’s backup and restore feature, you can make a copy of some or all your drivers and even restore your computer back to a previous point if an update doesn’t work out. The software also lets you schedule automatic scans as frequently as you want. We were pleased to see that the software doesn’t have any hidden bloatware, malware or ads and that it does only what it says it will do.","In case you have drivers on your system you know don’t need updates, the software has an exclusion feature that lets you select specific drivers to update. However, there is no uninstall option, which would let you delete old drivers you no longer need. The software does not disclose whether it relies solely on original equipment manufacturer (OEM) sources for updates, which means the download links it provides are not guaranteed to be free of malware.","The software is backed by a good amount of direct and indirect customer support. Unlike most driver updater software manufacturers, Systweak offers direct support over the phone and email. If you don’t want to talk to anyone directly, you can peruse its knowledgebase."]},"id":"7c5aaf85-c6bb-4496-862d-83d0f919ab47","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49250","url":"/advanced-driver-updater-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-04-15T18:39:31Z","datePublished":"2010-04-15T18:39:31Z","name":"Advanced Driver Updater 2.7","synopsis":"Advanced Driver Updater makes it easy to scan your system.
