In addition to delivering a variety of digital content, NeoTV also gives you access to live TV through Google TV. You also get access to the Google app store.","The Netgear NeoTV streaming player has several useful features. For example, picture-in-picture allows you to surf the web while watching live TV. Using the Google Chrome browser, you can also search across multiple sources of digital content at the same time.","Full access to the Google Play store is a nice feature, providing thousands of apps, movies, TV shows and songs. The Slingplayer app allows you to access live or recorded TV on your wireless devices and do things like schedule your DVR to record specific programs. Not only can you buy and rent entertainment, but Google will suggest the best deals on the movies and music you are shopping for, thus making it easy to shop and possibly saving you a lot of money in the long run.","The remote control includes a QWERTY keyboard on the back and shortcut buttons on the front to major apps and channels including Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, YouTube, HBO Go and Crackle. This is a nice feature that is becoming the norm on remotes for good reason. It makes navigating to the apps and channels you use the most easier. The My Media button takes you to your personal media files, where you can browse multiple sources of digital content at the same time.","The main issue with the remote is, at times, you have to align yourself with the box to get it to work consistently. The QWERTY keyboard could also use some backlighting for when you are navigating in a dimmed room, but that&#39;s a relatively small complaint for what is really a nice remote.","The addition of connectors like Ethernet, USB and HDMI ports make this Netgear streaming device more multi-dimensional and give you access to your personal media library. However, this media server is not equipped to play videos or music directly from your computer.","Netgear&#39;s customer service is available via email, phone or live chat.","The Netgear NeoTV with Google TV offers some impressive services, including several apps and channels, live TV access and access to your personal media files. The NeoTV is a capable home media server that has most of the features you&#39;d expect. It&#39;s worth taking a look at."]},"id":"ae27898d-17dd-46de-a9fb-5522cba26423","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56043","url":"/netgear-neotv-prime-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-03-25T20:02:11Z","datePublished":"2013-03-25T20:02:11Z","name":"Netgear NeoTV","synopsis":"The Netgear NeoTV is a well-performing and multi-functional home media server.
