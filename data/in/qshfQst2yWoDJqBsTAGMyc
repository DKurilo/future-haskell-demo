You have most likely heard of the well-known Windows Defender software suite, but the Windows Defender Virus we&#39;re referring to here is actually rogue <a href=\"/best-antivirus-software\">anti-virus software</a> that harms your computer and tries to steal your money.","<strong>Windows Defender vs. the Windows Defender Virus</strong>","You can go to Microsoft&#39;s website right now and download the free Windows Defender software. It&#39;s a Microsoft anti-virus product that many users and professional reviewers like and find effective at fighting all kinds of malware, including menacing spyware. Many, many people use this legitimate software that is pre-installed on all Windows XP and Vista operating systems.","Realizing that the Windows Defender brand name carries a great deal of recognition and trustworthiness, hackers created a rogue copycat with the same name. It&#39;s referred to as the Windows Defender Virus or sometimes as the Windows PC Defender Virus. It looks strikingly similar to the real deal, but it is a complete and total scam and should be removed from your computer as soon as possible.","<strong>What the Windows Defender Virus Does</strong>","The Windows Defender Virus is fake anti-virus software, and like other phonies of this type, you are saddled with it from downloading corrupt email attachments or visiting phishing websites. Phishing websites will often initiate downloads without your permission and will download the viral files secretly in the background, so you&#39;re never aware of what&#39;s going on.","All of a sudden, you&#39;ll start seeing endless pop-up alerts from Windows Defender, listing numerous infections that are currently present on your system. The language in these pop-ups is alarming, and the sense of urgency is high. You may see the Windows Defender name and immediately trust the software. When you try to use the Windows Defender Virus interface to initiate the process of eradicating the infections, another pop-up appears telling you that you cannot get rid of the viruses until you upgrade to the paid version of the product. This is your biggest red flag   the real Windows Defender is entirely free.","If you do upgrade, the hackers will charge your credit card for the bogus product, and will likely steal your credit card numbers to use for future, fraudulent purchases. If you do not upgrade, you will continue to see the endless, annoying pop-up ads, and the Windows Defender Virus will wreak havoc on your system. The virus will frequently redirect your web browser to more phishing websites, which puts you at risk for getting more infections, and it will slow down your entire system. The virus also blocks all legitimate anti-virus software you may use from launching, in order to prevent itself from being deleted. It also disables the Task Manager, Windows Registry and System Restore functions.","<strong>Removing the Windows Defender Virus</strong>","Removing this virus manually is not easy. You cannot even access Task Manager or the Windows Registry, since the virus disables these tools. You can manually remove the virus through downloading a long guide of instructions, but this is time consuming and you need to be at least somewhat technically savvy in order to be successful.","However, the best-rated anti-virus software suites do an excellent job of automatically removing pre-existing infections and protecting you from future threats. Since this software only costs between $30 and $60, you may find it worth your time to use top-notch anti-virus software to protect and clean up your PC.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"2d6ad8c2-4ddd-438e-b617-4d763dd14009","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6680","url":"/the-windows-defender-virus","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-drew","url":"/author/jessica-drew","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Drew","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"rhh7ib7xwNCRKbyjPJTKmB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-10-03T14:19:47Z","datePublished":"2011-10-03T14:19:47Z","name":"The Windows Defender Virus","synopsis":"The Windows Defender Virus confuses many users.","review":{},"strapline":"The Windows Defender Virus confuses many users.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-10-03T14:29:56Z","id":"qshfQst2yWoDJqBsTAGMyc","meta":{"title":"The Windows Defender Virus","description":"The Windows Defender Virus is bogus anti-virus software that is strikingly similar to the real Windows Defender."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:51:33Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/bSuPY5kBtFJu9FEiR8UkE.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:51:32Z","mimeType":"","name":"6680-the-windows-defender-virus.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6680-the-windows-defender-virus.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:51:32Z","id":"bSuPY5kBtFJu9FEiR8UkE","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bSuPY5kBtFJu9FEiR8UkE.jpg","alt":""},"title":"The Windows Defender Virus","description":"The Windows Defender Virus is bogus anti-virus software that is strikingly similar to the real Windows Defender."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/bSuPY5kBtFJu9FEiR8UkE.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:51:32Z","mimeType":"","name":"6680-the-windows-defender-virus.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6680-the-windows-defender-virus.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:51:32Z","id":"bSuPY5kBtFJu9FEiR8UkE","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bSuPY5kBtFJu9FEiR8UkE.jpg","alt":""},"title":"The Windows Defender Virus","description":"The Windows Defender Virus is bogus anti-virus software that is strikingly similar to the real Windows Defender."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/software/articles/the-windows-defender-virus/","label":"","tags":[]}
