While it costs less than larger equipment setups, it still allows for a wide range of workout activities from the comfort of your home. Weights can be added or removed to add an individualized experience to each workout, ultimately maximizing the effect of your exercises."]},"id":"088ff32f-f1ba-40c4-8bf0-187157e5f3db","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/fwUFoQS6b9sqrK8SHTzPxW.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57292-powertec-workbench-leverage-wb-ls3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fwUFoQS6b9sqrK8SHTzPxW.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"fwUFoQS6b9sqrK8SHTzPxW","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fwUFoQS6b9sqrK8SHTzPxW.jpg","alt":""},"id":"9ef89a49-e141-4da2-976e-1fbf462a07d2","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Many consumer reviews praise the quality of manufacturing, taking special note of the powder coating across the frame that ensures the home exercise equipment won’t easily chip. The high- and low-pulley cables are vinyl coated, which makes for a very quiet and smooth operation. The weigh sleeves are coated in PVC, which means loading and unloading is a quiet process. The pads for areas like the leg extension and hold down are covered in a vinyl pad that looks akin to leather, but maintains a cushioned feel for added comfort.","One thing to take special note of is it doesn’t come with any weights, which means you’ll need to purchase weights with 2-inch holes in order to fully use this home gym equipment. This helps in reducing the overall cost of the machine to better reinforce the structure itself. Thanks to such added emphasis on the design, owners can use up to 500 pounds in weights for chest and thighs and 300 pounds for back and triceps. This proves a significant advantage over other options due to their reliance on weight stacks that can’t be expanded.","While the exercise chart included with the Powertec Workbench Leverage WB-LS indicates the unit provides more than 20 free weight exercises, the availability of a high-, mid- and low-pulley system means you can do just about any exercise you want to perform on a bench. This best gym equipment is built around a standard bench that uses a lever arm as a replacement for barbells, making it a significantly safer workout machine to use when alone.","The added cost of weights will run up the bill for the Powertec Workbench Leverage WB-LS, but the quality of this home fitness equipment makes it a small inconvenience at worst. The design of the unit overall is a testament to the quality of Powertec and the work they put into making not only a sturdy, but also a valuable workout resource."]},"id":"064c8aa8-e9f6-41be-983f-e4ba7127f46f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57320","url":"/powertec-workbench-leverage-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-08-27T12:54:37Z","datePublished":"2013-08-27T12:54:37Z","name":"Powertec Workbench Leverage WB-LS","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-08-27T12:54:37Z","id":"xiDnStAogRvQo7edxG2DZ9","meta":{"title":"Powertec Workbench Leverage WB-LS Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Powertec Workbench Multi-System is a comprehensive home gym with more than 10 stations for a full workout.
