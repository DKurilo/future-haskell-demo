Popmoney works with banks to facilitate the transfers directly. This adds convenience because you don&#39;t need to worry about holding money in a third-party account, but it does come with fees, especially if your bank is not a member of Popmoney&#39;s network.","Just like with most peer-to-peer payment apps, you can download this to your smartphone or work directly online with the Popmoney program or your own bank&#39;s online banking system. You need the recipient&#39;s email address or mobile phone number to send money or request money. The person is notified of the transaction and can then accept it.","Although a P2P payment service, Popmoney can be used for more than just getting money to a friend. You can use it to for recurring payments, such as getting the rent to your landlord or splitting the internet bill with your roommate. You can request money from individuals or from groups. This can be especially useful not only when splitting a lunch bill but also when collecting money for clubs, such as getting new uniforms for your son&#39;s soccer team.","Thousands of banks are part of Popmoney&#39;s network. You should register with your bank if it is a member. Otherwise, you can register on Popmoney&#39;s website to use the service. This P2P payment service has transactions fees of $0.95 per transaction to send or request money. It&#39;s free to receive money. In addition, it has limits on the amount you can send per day: $500 using a debit card, $2,000 if transferring directly from your bank account. These prices and limits are only for those using Popmoney directly. If you are using it through a member bank, you should contact it for information on the fees and limits it applies.","Transactions take a day or two to complete. If you are doing the transaction from a debit card, it is delivered the next day as long as you make the transaction before 5 p.m.","Popmoney transactions are handled by Fiserv, which is an online banking service that handles around 70 percent of all bill payments made at U.S. financial institutions. The website is regularly scanned by Verisign. Popmoney also requires recipients to verify their identity before accepting a payment."]},"id":"1810991c-3885-4dac-9729-e9a347db6aa8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67659","url":"/popmoney-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-02-05T17:31:23Z","datePublished":"2016-02-05T17:31:23Z","name":"Popmoney","synopsis":"Most person-to-person (P2P) payment systems require you to transfer or hold money in their separate account in order to complete transactions.
