Series"},"id":"ebbd1b4d-ad46-4793-a10f-628ef746c157","type":"heading"},{"data":{"text":"Introduction"},"id":"79117216-e94b-4bc7-8676-10ad44897231","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cobra ACXT 545 walkie talkie set has many of the features that we look for in the <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-walkie-talkies\">best walkie talkies</a>, and its light design makes it a good choice for hikers and campers. However, it didn’t do well in our range tests and is better suited for communication over relatively short distances.","In our range and clarity tests, the ACXT 545 was one of the worst performing units we tested. It worked well on our high-power GMRS test up to 1 mile in distance, receiving accuracy scores of 93 and 95 percent over a half mile and a mile. But that score dropped almost in half at a mile and a half on the GMRS frequency and continued to plummet at 2 miles.","On the lower-powered FRS channel, we found the clarity to be middling up to 1 mile, but then the unit completely stopped transmitting and receiving at a mile and a half.","The ACXT 545 comes with three rechargeable AA batteries, a charging dock and a USB charging cable. If the rechargeable batteries run out of power, you can swap them with regular AA batteries. One nice feature of this walkie talkie is the micro-USB charging port, so you can charge the batteries without a dedicated charger.","This two-way radio offers 22 channels of communication, which is typical of most walkie talkies. While some of the models we tested had more channel options, we don’t think this is a negative point. All of the radios we tested, including this Cobra, let you set privacy codes – a specific code embedded on the front-end of your transmission that limits the conversation to others using that exact code. Because these privacy codes allow you to set specific channels for communication within a select group, having more channels isn’t always necessary to find a clear way to communicate.","The ACXT 545 allows you to access NOAA weather channels and listen to local weather reports, which is especially helpful for campers. Should an emergency alert be issued, your radio will emit a tone to warn you of an incoming weather emergency. This radio also has a built-in LED flashlight.","The Cobra ACXT 545 weighs in at 6.5 ounces, solidly in the middle of our testing units. This is an extremely portable walkie talkie that won&#39;t burden you while you hike. Although it doesn&#39;t come with a headset, there is a standard jack, and the radio has a hands-free function.","While the grip on the ACXT 545 wasn’t as tacky or as secure as the higher-end Cobra models we tested, this walkie talkie features more rubber than most of the units we reviewed. The ACXT 545 has strips of rubber on the sides of the radio and covering the speaker grill.","This is a water-resistant walkie talkie radio that meets IPX2 standards. That means the handset won’t fizzle out if you get it a little wet in a rainstorm, but you wouldn’t want to drop it in a lake, or even a puddle. The ACXT 545 features a non-adjustable clip. However, we found it to be stiff and hard to get open, which made it difficult for our testers to attach the radio to their belts.","Cobra supports the ACXT 545 with a one-year warranty. If you have any questions, you can download a user manual or browse the FAQs on the Cobra website. Customer service representatives are available by email and telephone.","The Cobra ACXT 545 is a good walkie talkie with a full range of features and a lightweight design. However, its average range is not as good as most other walkie talkie we reviewed. As long as you are using it outdoors and aren’t getting too far away from other people in your group, it should work well enough, as you can expect an effective range of around a mile."]},"id":"314afbe1-57c1-4080-92a1-5619510df580","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ee2ca065-ac1a-4a0e-b80d-0f83e93ce56a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cobra ACXT 545 is a good camping walkie talkie with a full range of features and a lightweight design.
