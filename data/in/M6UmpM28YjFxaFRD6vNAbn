In most houses, the washer is almost constantly working to get clothes clean. But while you might take your washer for granted, you&#39;ll definitely miss it if it starts failing you. Whether you&#39;re moving into your first home or you&#39;re replacing an older model, it&#39;s important that you get the right machine for your needs. Depending on the space in your home, your washing habits and your overall lifestyle, there may be a <a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\">front-load washer</a> that is ideal for you.","<strong>Laundry Habits</strong>","If you tend to try and get as much laundry done as possible, you may need a high capacity front load washer. Depending on your habits, one washing machine may be better for you than others. Larger loads require a high capacity washing machine, while families who work and play hard may need a washer with excellent stain extraction. What&#39;s more, if you have different types of laundry and fabrics to wash, a machine with a variety of settings might be a better fit for your needs.","<strong>Efficiency</strong>","A washer&#39;s efficiency refers to how little energy it uses to operate. Choosing a high-efficiency washer makes sense for a number of different reasons. For one, a higher-efficiency washer uses less energy and can therefore help you conserve electricity and water. Similarly, opting for a high-efficiency model could actually help you save money and recoup some of the costs of buying a new washer. Keep this in mind when shopping for the perfect washer. If you don&#39;t purchase a washer that has the EnergyStar logo, choose one that has settings for temperature so you can manually regulate the amount of hot water it uses.","<strong>Size and Space</strong>","Your home or apartment probably only has so much room reserved for a washer and dryer, so you&#39;ll need to take space into consideration. Washers can range greatly in size so find the perfect washer by first measuring the space of the laundry room or area in your home. A bonus of the best frontloading washers is you don&#39;t need space to open, which means you can stack a washer and dryer together to save on space.","<strong>Lifestyle</strong>","Finally, your lifestyle will likely dictate the type of washer you end up bringing home. Choose one that you can use time and time again and one that has the settings and options that you&#39;ll need   from a deep stain release to a delicate cycle. If possible, head to an appliance store where you can test and interact with washers to see what you do and don&#39;t like.","Washers can be a major investment as far as appliances go, but it would be hard to live without one. By taking the time to look at different models and features, you can choose a washer specifically to meet your family&#39;s needs. While it may not be the most glamorous item you purchase for your home, it can be among the most important, so choose wisely.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "]},"id":"5ae9dcd3-5426-4854-870f-61607a1e4b08","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8355","url":"/how-to-choose-the-right-washer-for-your-needs","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-curtis","url":"/author/j-curtis","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.
