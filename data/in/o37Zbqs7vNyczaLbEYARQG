This <a href=\"/best-truck-rental-services\">truck rental service</a> is available in the contiguous United States and six Canadian provinces. If you&#39;re planning a long-distance one-way move, Penske gives you nine days to complete the trip. The bright yellow trucks in Penske&#39;s fleet are available in 12-feet, 16-feet, 22-feet and 26-feet lengths. If you need to tow your car, rent at least the 16-footer, because the smaller trucks don’t allow for towing. Penske also doesn&#39;t offer trailers for rent, or allow you to tow your own trailer using its rental trucks.","Penske&#39;s website is easy to navigate and a great resource to start your quote. Fill out the online form with information like the date and where you plan to pick up and drop off the truck. You can complete the reservation process online, or call a representative to obtain a quote. We waited for more than 10 minutes with the online chat feature to get an answer to a simple question about one-way rental rates.","Penske doesn’t charge a mileage fee for one-way rentals. Instead, the daily rate increases to between $200 and $500 per day depending on truck size and what time of year you request the quote. Penske guarantees reservations if you reserve your truck at least 48 hours before the pickup time.","You can pick up and drop off a Penske truck rental at more than 2,000 locations, including select Home Depot stores. The popular big-box hardware store partnered with Penske to rent trucks to its customers, which is convenient if you need to haul wood or appliances for a home project. If you’re having a hard time finding a Penske location near you, try <a href=\"/u-haul-review\">U-Haul</a> instead, as U-Haul has more rental locations than any other company we researched.","In addition to truck rentals, Penske offers a variety of services to help with your move from start to finish. You can rent a tow dolly or car carrier to save money and time while bringing your vehicle to your new place. If you have a front-wheel-drive car, we recommend a tow dolly, which is less expensive. Also, the company sells a packing kit which includes boxes, bubble wrap and packing tape. You can also buy tie-downs, locks and protective covers.","Penske partners with Simple Moving Labor to offer loading and unloading assistance. Mention you are renting a truck from Penske when you request a quote from Simple Moving Labor to receive a discount on labor services.","Penske is a great option if you are planning a one-way move across the lower 48 states or in Canada. The rates are competitive and allow you to take the scenic route because you won’t incur a mileage charge for one-way rentals. This service offers most of the important additional equipment to safely and efficiently load the truck."]},"id":"af8f6573-0b12-454b-87a9-54d111f36b65","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50315","url":"/penske-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-09T17:34:18Z","datePublished":"2010-08-09T17:34:18Z","name":"Penske","synopsis":"Penske is one of three national truck rental companies that offer local and one-way truck rentals.
