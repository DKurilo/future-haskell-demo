You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Similar to the best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html\">fitness trackers</a>, the Basis Carbon Steel can track many aspects of your health and fitness including your sleep habits and steps taken. Although it is heavier than other fitness trackers, the Basis does a great job at helping you meet you fitness goals.","Tracking features of the Basis are some of the best we&#39;ve seen on comparable products. The Basis fitness tracker device can monitor your sleep patterns, steps taken, calories burned and distance traveled. What makes the Basis different from other trackers is the heart rate monitor, perspiration monitor and skin-temperature indicator. From these sensors, the Basis can tell how long you&#39;ve been wearing the device and how intense your workout is. Similar to most fitness trackers, however, the Basis is only semi-accurate. We found steps taken to be mostly correct, and while calories burned and heart rate were close, they were not 100% accurate.","The largest downside to the Basis is its design. It may look great, but the bulky watch face weighs 1.55 ounces, much more than other fitness devices, and sticks up quite a bit to catch on clothing. While it sits on your wrist like other devices, the Basis isn&#39;t as comfortable as other, lighter devices. The wide silicone band is hard to adjust always feels either too tight or too loose. Also, the band is water resistant, so you can shower but not swim with it. A four-day battery life is a bit less than other comparable products as well.","The watch itself is easy to use. A one-inch screen shows you steps taken, heart rate and calories burned. If you&#39;re outside on a sunny day, though, the screen is a bit hard to read. The backlight is not bright and the watch is impossible to read in direct sunlight.","This personal fitness device syncs with you iPhone, Android phone or online account so you can check your progress anywhere. To manually sync your device, pushing the button on the right of the screen wirelessly sends your data to your free account. The Basis saves your data for about a week, so you need to sync your device at least once a week to not lose your stats.","Basis provides a one-year warranty for your fitness tracker, which is a very helpful addition. Although there is no provided technical support hotline, the company is easy to email and responds with answers quickly. You can also check FAQs and the manual for additional help."]},"id":"ee17d550-3a02-485c-8de9-28c4c49508e7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"99117a19-ef62-43af-9f9e-9a52f3c21bd2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Basis Carbon Steel has some of the best features we found during our fitness tracker review.
