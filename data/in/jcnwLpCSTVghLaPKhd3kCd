Its doctors can prescribe medications, and the service may take your insurance. This telehealth service may not be available in your state, so check the online map before registering.","Like all telemedicine companies, LiveHealth Online cannot handle medical emergencies. However, it is good for those off-hours medical problems that can inspire a trip to the emergency room or after-hours clinic. These include flu, rashes, urinary tract infections and other common but sometimes serious ailments.","LiveHealth Online works via a webcam-equipped computer or mobile device. You can download the LiveHealth Online app for iOS or Android. Once you have downloaded the app, you can sign in, creating an account if you wish. This service will keep records of past visits if you set up an account.","Once you&#39;re signed in, you can select from one of the doctors on call. The app lets you read bios so you can choose one you feel comfortable with and who is qualified for your particular issue. There are some that speak fluent Spanish. Then, you are connected. The typical visit takes about 10 minutes. Doctors can prescribe medications if needed and have them sent to your preferred pharmacy. They do not prescribe &#34;lifestyle&#34; drugs or narcotics, however.","If you are in need of mental health services, there is a telepsychology service. You can register to view a list of participating therapists in your state. From there, you can schedule an appointment online or by calling the LiveHealth Online customer support 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. any day of the week. Typical visits last 45 minutes.","This telehealth company charges a flat rate per medical visit, which is a little more than the standard copay. Telepsychology visits vary in price. However, it can file with your insurance company first. It works with many insurances, so you may find your charge reduced. LiveHealth Online also has a service that allows doctors to virtually meet with their regular patients. Ask your doctor if he or she is part of the service."]},"id":"ff4f6985-d82e-4b80-9690-71e0239a11eb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68818","url":"/livehealth-online-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-22T21:22:39Z","datePublished":"2016-11-22T21:22:39Z","name":"LiveHealth Online","synopsis":"LiveHealth Online is a telemedicine service offering 24/7 access to online doctors for the diagnosis and treatment of common ailments.
