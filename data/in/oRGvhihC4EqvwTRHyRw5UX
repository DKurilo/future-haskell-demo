It offers both side-impact protection and energy-absorbent foam. In its rear-facing position, it can keep a child secure up to 40 pounds. Then, when your child is ready to switch to the front-facing position, the seat will support up to 65 pounds. Unfortunately, since it stays in your car, you will have to buy a separate travel system for your infant&#39;s stroller needs.","The car seat meets all federal safety and crash-testing requirements. In its reclined rear-facing position, the baby car seat supports a child as light as 5 pounds. Unfortunately, it is not a good choice if you have a premature child, as those babies are usually born under 5 pounds. The rear-facing seat will support your child up to 40 pounds. The front-facing position ranges from 22 to 65 pounds and at least one year of age. This means that once your child is in the front-facing seat, he or she will be secured all the way into grade school.","The Triumph has an easily adjustable harness to match your growing baby. The seat comes with a built-in cup holder that has an elastic band to fit cups of multiple sizes and shapes. If your baby has an accident, the cushions are machine washable. You can also recline the seat to a comfortable angle. However, like all convertible car seats, it is not compatible with any strollers.","Evenflo offers a short 90-day warranty, but the website offers downloadable user manuals. You cannot search for a local retailer on the website, but you can contact customer service by telephone and email. We received quick responses to our emails."]},"id":"46fb649c-30be-445f-bc04-e085c7964a3f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e3d9e4f7-13d3-49bc-bc14-e0c2a3cbb7fa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Evenflo Triumph LX Platinum is a safe, convertible car seat with energy-absorbent foam and side-impact protection.
