The kit starts you out with a smart hub, motion sensor, two door and window sensors, a key fob, and the necessary cables and batteries. You also get security stickers, which can help deter intruders.","You can choose to set up your SwannOne home security system by Ethernet cable and your router or a wireless connection. However, everything has to be set up using a web browser and not the mobile app, which is unusual for DIY security systems, though <a href=\"/simplisafe-review\">SimpliSafe</a> uses a similar method. Installation took a bit longer than we anticipated because the hub had to update its firmware.","When we tested this system and set off the alarm, it was noticeably quiet in the room. The hub is not equipped with a built-in siren, nor is one included in the kit. You can buy an indoor or outdoor siren separately, though. A notification was sent to our phone, and we received an email and a text message, so we knew the alarm had been triggered. With the free self-monitoring plan, you can set the system to send notifications to two users, but if you want more, you have to subscribe to professional monitoring for $19.99 a month.","For a time Swann also sold a second hub, the DVR8-5000, which doubled as a digital video recorder and came with four 1080p wired security cameras, but it appears to have been discontinued.","One of the benefits of choosing SwannOne is its smart home connectivity. SwannOne&#39;s hubs work with Nest and ZigBee devices, so you have plethora of smart home devices you can connect in your home. However, SwannOne doesn&#39;t offer many security devices compared to <a href=\"/nest-secure-review\">Nest Secure</a> and <a href=\"/iris-review\">Iris</a>.","Like most DIY security systems, Swann only offers a one-year warranty on its products. This is one of the best companies for customer and tech support, though, because it has 24/7 support, and you can contact representatives by phone, live chat and email.","Although there is no built-in siren included to scare off intruders, SwannOne&#39;s DIY home security starter kit is still a good choice for securing your home because it sends emails, texts and push notifications when your home&#39;s security is compromised. It also includes several options for home automation and monitoring."]},"id":"6b3ffb69-3a18-4d7f-8e6b-6c09303e2e3d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67983","url":"/swannone-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-14T18:49:35Z","datePublished":"2016-06-14T18:49:35Z","name":"SwannOne SSH-KIT02 Starter Kit","synopsis":"Swann’s SwannOne DIY home security starter kit comes with the basics you need to start securing your home, and it's a flexible system that gives you lots of options.","review":{"rating":83,"verdict":"SwannOne is great for basic home automation and offers professional monitoring.","pros":["Swann offers 24/7 customer support."],"cons":["This system does not have a built-in siren."]},"strapline":"Swann’s SwannOne DIY home security starter kit comes with the basics you need to start securing your home, and it's a flexible system that gives you lots of options.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-10-03T00:00:00Z","id":"jgduUxCiPXmX6szCVZBv7V","meta":{"title":"SwannOne Alarm Starter Kit Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"SwannOne&#039;s DIY home security starter kit includes a key fob for arming and disarming the system quickly.
