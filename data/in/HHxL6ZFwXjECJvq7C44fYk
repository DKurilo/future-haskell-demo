On the most basic level, it gives you an inventory of the devices on a corporate network. As technology progresses and we become more reliant on mobile devices to conduct basic business transactions, enterprises are providing their employees with mobile devices to manage both their personal and professional lives. Since these devices are designed to go just about everywhere with you, you need to take additional steps to preserve company data and make sure your employees aren t violating terms of use on their devices.","Mobile device management software, or MDM, gives you control over the devices on your network. When a new device is enrolled, you can apply security measures, set up restrictions, share data, track downloads and applications, or view usage history. Most platforms give you some degree of all of these features, although some will charge more or require premium memberships to unlock all of them. These tools are helpful for information technology (IT) departments and managerial operations because you can use them to track activity and maintain the integrity of corporate data. Some popular MDM software options include <a href=\"/software/privacy/best-mobile-device-management-software/soti-mobicontrol-review/\">Soti MobiControl</a>, <a href=\"/software/privacy/best-mobile-device-management-software/microsoft-intune-review/\">Microsoft Intune</a>, and <a href=\"/software/privacy/best-mobile-device-management-software/2x-mdm-review/\">2X MDM</a>.","<strong>Mobile Device Management Software: What to Look For</strong>","What you want from your MDM will largely depend upon your organization s goals. However, there are certain features that are commonplace among these platforms, and if you know what you want before you start reviewing your options, your shopping will be a lot easier.","<strong>Operating Systems</strong><br/>If your organization doesn t practice the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, this will be much easier to determine because you ll probably give your employees the same or similar devices. This means that their operating systems will probably be the same, and you can choose a platform that covers your one primary provider. If you do offer the BYOD option, you can bet that your employees will use different operating systems and devices.","When you choose an MDM, see if it matches Android, iOS, Windows Phone or BlackBerry operating systems. Make sure it s compatible with the operating systems your employees are using.","<strong>Scope</strong><br/>Some MDM platforms have license limitations, while others offer bulk discounts when you purchase licenses for a certain number of devices. Because prices are constantly changing, we didn t go into pricing details, but you should definitely look at the load capability and pricing structure of your mobile device management software provider. This is particularly important if you re in the middle of a growth spurt because you ll want to make sure your IT department only has to use one solution for all devices.","<strong>Security</strong><br/>This is a big factor, particularly in corporate environments. Not all management options give additional security measures, and some only protect against certain types of threats. If your organization deals with privileged or private information, make sure your MDM does too.","<strong>Flexibility</strong><br/>You ll want to make sure you can configure your privileges and user accounts for different roles within your organization, particularly if you re going to be implementing your MDM on a large scale. Different employees will need access to different information, and using one blanket platform to control all devices on the network won t give you the flexibility or specialization your organization will need long-term.","<strong>App Management</strong><br/>Using applications significantly simplifies mobile functions. However, many apps request access to private data and are given windows into personal information. This can mean worms or hacking tools, which can reach corporate records just like on a computer. When you pick your mobile device management software, make sure you can manage app downloads and settings as well.","Oftentimes, your enterprise will also have personalized apps for employees. Making this available and customizable on the network is possible with many platforms.","Mobile device management software can simplify a lot of data sharing and communication mechanisms within your organization. Because your employees will be using mobile devices regardless of what your policy states, creating an open-door, tolerant policy can help build employee relationships and show investment in your workforce. However, in order to make sure your employees have access to all the information they need and aren t abusing privileges, MDMs lend structure."]},"id":"d686ecf1-10a0-470d-bf21-9ef4e460d851","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"51c0c2ba-4ca1-4138-8f3e-181adb681d98","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://buyerzone.com/software/mobile-device-management/rfqz?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788&keywordID=MobileDeviceManagement\">2X MDM</a>","<a href=\"http://buyerzone.com/software/mobile-device-management/rfqz?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788&amp;keywordID=MobileDeviceManagement\">AirWatch</a>","<a href=\"http://buyerzone.com/software/mobile-device-management/rfqz?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788&amp;keywordID=MobileDeviceManagement\">BlackBerry Enterprise Service</a>","<a href=\"http://buyerzone.com/software/mobile-device-management/rfqz?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788&keywordID=MobileDeviceManagement\">Globo</a>","<a href=\"http://buyerzone.com/software/mobile-device-management/rfqz?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788&amp;keywordID=MobileDeviceManagement\">MaaS360</a>","<a href=\"http://buyerzone.com/software/mobile-device-management/rfqz?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788&amp;keywordID=MobileDeviceManagement\">McAfee Mobile Security</a>","<a href=\"http://buyerzone.com/software/mobile-device-management/rfqz?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788&amp;keywordID=MobileDeviceManagement\">Microsoft Intune</a>","<a href=\"http://buyerzone.com/software/mobile-device-management/rfqz?publisherId=21232&publisherTypeId=1788&keywordID=MobileDeviceManagement\">MobileIron Enterprise</a>","<a href=\"http://buyerzone.com/software/mobile-device-management/rfqz?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788&amp;keywordID=MobileDeviceManagement\">Soti MobiControl</a>","<a href=\"http://buyerzone.com/software/mobile-device-management/rfqz?publisherId=21232&amp;publisherTypeId=1788&amp;keywordID=MobileDeviceManagement\">Spiceworks Mobile Security</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"8f2af1d5-b710-4e1a-875c-aa4307b097d3","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1331","url":"/best-mobile-device-management-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-02T18:30:17Z","datePublished":"2015-02-10T20:04:40Z","name":"Mobile Device Management Software Review","synopsis":"Keep your business's information safe on company- and employee-owned mobile devices with mobile device management software.","review":{},"strapline":"Keep your business's information safe on company- and employee-owned mobile devices with mobile device management software.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-10T20:04:40Z","id":"HHxL6ZFwXjECJvq7C44fYk","meta":{"title":"The Best Mobile Device Management Software","description":"Our teams have compared the best mobile device management software for 2017.
