With high resolution, excellent thermal precision and a host of auxiliary features, the Ti300 produces sharp, information-laden images that you can share with ease.","This camera produces infrared images with a resolution of 240 x 180 pixels. At this resolution, it produces images that are clear and detailed so you can easily locate problem areas such as overloaded circuits or small gaps in insulation.","For even more detail, the Ti300 features an onboard 5-megapixel camera. Infrared images shot with the Ti300 can be blended with these higher-resolution images to produce more detailed thermal images. This can be helpful when you work with complicated things like circuit boards or intricate machinery.","You can capture these images in several formats: BMP, JPG or IS2. While the BMP and JPG formats display the visual thermal information, there&#39;s no actual temperature information embedded within them. Fluke&#39;s proprietary IS2 format, on the other hand, is loaded with information, so you can see the radiometric details (temperatures) from different areas of the photograph. The downside to this format versus radiometric JPGs is that you can only open and view IS2 images using Fluke&#39;s own software. You have to convert them before you can share them with anyone who doesn&#39;t have the required software.","Thermal precision is an important part of any thermal-imaging camera, and the Ti300 is as precise as the best infrared cameras. The accuracy rating of plus or minus 2 percent means you can be sure that your temperature readings are never far off. Its large temperature measurement range of minus 20 degrees to 1,200 degrees Celsius lets the Ti300 measure temperatures far above most other thermographic cameras. It&#39;s also sensitive to temperature differences less than or equal to 0.05 degrees, which allows you to discern the temperatures of several parts of the same thermal image.","In order to capture temperature changes in real time, the Ti300 is able to record radiometric video using its proprietary IS3 format. These files, when opened using Fluke&#39;s software, display temperature differences throughout the clip.","Excellent image quality and thermal precision are the foundations for this camera, but its auxiliary features complement its power with deeper functionality. Its 3.5-inch touchscreen display makes navigating menus and settings a simple affair. A built-in laser pointer and flashlight help to illuminate and isolate problem areas for clear, communicative images despite poor lighting or overcrowded subjects. In addition, the ability to add text and voice annotations to each photo makes your thermographic images even more powerful communication tools.","The Ti300&#39;s Wi-Fi connectivity allows easy communication with clients or co-workers. It&#39;s simple to keep others informed of your findings using Fluke&#39;s Android and Apple mobile applications. All you have to do is connect a mobile device to your camera and you can immediately download and share information as you gather it. In a world that is increasingly connected through mobile technology, features like this will only become more important. Investing in such technology now will help sustain the value of your camera over time.","Durability and battery life are primary concerns for any tool used in professional environments. The Ti300 is built tough to withstand falls of up to 6.6 feet and includes a two lithium-ion batteries that last up to four hours apiece. An included external charger lets you charge one battery while you&#39;re using the other to keep you working as long as you need to be.Â ","Fluke backs up this product with a two-year warranty against manufacturer defects and a host of informational literature available on its website. In case you fail to find the information you need on the website, phone and email support is also available."]},"id":"342eecab-714c-45ea-9e1a-b42a6b308be5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"185525fc-9f2a-4c12-9f41-cde31e0dc298","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Image quality, thermal precision and a full set of extra features make Fluke&#39;s Ti300 one of the best infrared cameras available.
