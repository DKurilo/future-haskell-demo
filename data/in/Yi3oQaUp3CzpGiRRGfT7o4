You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Wondershare DVD Ripper for Mac<strong> </strong>is clean, well-presented and well-made <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">Mac DVD copy software</a> application. The inclusion of video editing options helps to set this application a step ahead of its competitors. Video-editing options also push this software toward more uses than simply ripping DVDs, as it can be used to polish home videos and other projects outside of simply watching DVDs on your mobile devices. The Mac DVD ripping software features HD ripping support and some basic video editing features.","Upon first opening the software, it is clear that the developers wanted to present a great product. The design is sleek and appealing, letting you know that your DVDs are in capable hands. It’s important to remember that looks alone don’t make the Mac DVD copy software application, but it sure helps. Even the video editing features are easy to use in this application.","The real standout features of this Mac DVD copy software application are the video editing capabilities. They have included three options for editing your DVDs: Trim, Crop &amp; Effect. Each of the functions has its own button directly on the main screen, making them easy to find and alter. The trim effect is for choosing portions of the video to rip. Let’s say that your favorite movie has a final scene that sets up the sequel after the credits. With the trim feature you can remove the credits so this scene plays directly after the scene prior to the credits.","This is a handy feature if you want to cut out the opening credits, or a portion of the film that is too extreme or racy for the whole family, or create your own video trailer for a home video. The crop function is for removing those black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. For those of you who can’t stand all that wasted space, this is a nice feature.","Finally, the effect feature opens a menu that allows you to adjust the picture quality with sliders brightness, contrast and saturation. Also, the Mac DVD copy software application allows you to apply video effects to the whole film, such as making your movie sepia-toned, or completely black and white. While doing this to an entire feature length movie is debatable, this feature could be great to help add a little pizzazz by easily and quickly editing a home movie. Each of these features allow for you to preview the film in the menu and alter the each effect in real time, allowing you to see your changes immediately.","Once you actually begin ripping a film, the progress screen has lots of information to let you keep an eye on the progress of your rip. It monitors the minutes of film that have been converted, the estimated time left in the rip, a progress bar, and a screen to show frames from the film as it rips. Don&#39;t use this Mac DVD copy software application if you want to make physical duplicates of your double-layer DVDs. It&#39;s not able to handle the compression required to squeeze a DVD-9 down onto a single-layer disc. Use this application instead for putting movies on multiple mobile devices.","All the major formats are supported for a staggering array of devices. This Mac DVD copy software application wants you to make sure you can watch anything anywhere on whatever you have in your possession. They also included HD video support, which hasn’t become universal in all converters. This makes this software a very viable option for those of you who have a lot of HD movies to consider.","Help and support is provided through a variety of options to make sure your questions are answered to your satisfaction. There is a help manual that walks you through all the features and effects and shows you how to use them. The website also has an email support contact. The most interesting venue of support is the self-service wizard that helps you fix a problem yourself, rather than having to wait for an answer from a tech at Wondershare Software."]},"id":"ca2ca6f2-c2a5-4295-b6cd-775efc2d43be","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d1086941-3624-43ee-9034-f6c703241a72","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Wondershare DVD Ripper</strong> <strong>for Mac</strong> is a great application.
