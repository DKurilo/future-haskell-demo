You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The TeckNet C016 is an <a href=\"/best-webcams\">affordable webcam</a> with decent video and image quality. It supports basic HD video, shooting at up to 30 frames per second in 720p. However, it struggles to take a decent-quality still image. And like many budget-friendly web cameras, it lacks many of the extra features that we expect to see in top-of-the-line webcams.","The C016 films in basic HD quality and shoots images in 5 megapixels, which is just a third of the best webcam we reviewed, the Logitech HD Pro C920. We found its video to be a little bit grainy and discolored when compared to higher-end PC cameras. The grain issues lessen if you’re in a well-lit area, but the video remains considerably less clear. The color problems are less pronounced, but they look less natural than some of the other cameras we reviewed.","The webcam doesn’t offer convenient automatic focus. Though advanced users may prefer to have full control over the focus, being forced to focus manually may present a struggle for the novice user. Additionally, it does not have face tracking. Therefore, it focuses on movement rather than eyes. If you are an animated speaker, the webcam will have trouble tracking you accurately. It also lacks digital zoom and motion detection. It does have noise-reduction technology, however, so it can reduce or eliminate background noise for slightly improved audio.","This PC camera does not have any of the convenience features we look for, such as one-click uploading to social networks or facial recognition for faster logins. The lens is made of glass, however, which will give you a clearer picture than webcams with a plastic lens would. It also lets you tilt the camera for more precise framing. The webcam has a sturdy base that you can set on top of a table or your monitor.","The web camera ships with a 1.5-year manufacturer warranty, which is a longer coverage period than many other webcams offer. You can also contact the company’s technical support team directly with questions, or peruse the FAQs section on the manufacturer’s website."]},"id":"2538b427-4278-433a-af3f-5c8b029e6d3b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"40ff6819-30e5-4957-ad86-0ba1e74d4c67","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The TeckNet C016 is an affordable webcam with decent video quality and customer support.
