This programmable thermostat has decent temperature-control and energy-management features. Lennox customer support tends to vary from dealer to dealer.","This Wi-Fi thermostat is compatible with two-stage systems for both heating and cooling, though most competitors offer at least three heating stages. The unit has a narrow, half-degree temperature swing, which is great for keeping your home comfortable. You can override your scheduling for temperature with the one-touch away mode so you don&#39;t waste energy heating and cooling an empty house.","This programmable thermostat is not the most compatible product of the thermostats we reviewed. The Lennox site indicates that the smart thermostat is most effective when used with premium Lennox equipment. However, if you have another brand of furnace or air conditioning unit, a Lennox dealer can use add-on equipment to make it work with many existing systems, Lennox brand or not. You can&#39;t install this wireless thermostat yourself, so you must make an appointment with the local Lennox dealership to have it installed. This unit is better than the average home thermostat.","This unit has a large touchscreen interface that offers information and control over much more than temperature. The user interface and mobile app are decent, though sometimes it is difficult to navigate if you need to change a setting that is not on the home screen. Lennox iComfort Wi-Fi also lets you govern your home&#39;s humidity and your system&#39;s fan. This thermostat sends alerts and reminders when your system needs new filters or any other kind of maintenance. You can also get local weather forecasts on the Lennox iComfort Wi-Fi&#39;s screen.","You can design your thermostat to fit in with your home&#39;s decor with customizable skins. This customization includes the option to fill the frame and faceplate with your own family photos or to choose from a range of Nuvango skin designs. Lennox is good in terms of customer support, though it does vary based on your dealer. The warranty for this unit is five years, better than all other thermostats in our review. For direct technical support, it&#39;s best to go through your local dealer, as Lennox only provides telephone support."]},"id":"047a9673-692f-47c4-b370-bbe2a1b9bb27","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"05017755-e9d8-4733-b83f-0b80c7a0e112","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Lennox iComfort Wi-Fi does not have many energy-management features that you might want in a thermostat.
