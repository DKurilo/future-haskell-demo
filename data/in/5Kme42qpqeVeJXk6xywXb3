Along with being our pick for best travel, it’s also a strong performer in terms of user experience. Based on tester feedback and consumer reviews, both this device and the <a href=\"/essential-skin-solutions-review\">Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin Brushing System</a> earned A marks. Only the <a href=\"/clarisonic-review\">Clarisonic Mia 2</a> earned a higher performance score. If you have a limited budget, the Vanity Planet is much more affordable. With an MSRP of $49.99, it costs about $120 less than the Clarisonic.","The Vanity Planet device is designed to be gentle on sensitive skin. It has a soft cleansing brush for normal skin, a silicone brush for sensitive skin and an exfoliating brush for all skin types. The cleansing brushes are designed for daily use, while the exfoliating attachment should be used only two to three times weekly – and just once a week if your skin is sensitive.","“It massaged my face gently and felt relaxing at the same time it cleaned,” said one of our testers, who had never used a facial cleansing brush before. “I haven’t ever considered buying anything like this, but now I’m rethinking it.”","<a href=\"https://www.kachiuleemd.com/\">Dr. Kachiu C. Lee</a>, Assistant Professor of Dermatology at Brown University and the Director of the Laser and Aesthetics Center in Providence, Rhode Island, advises all her patients to add facial cleansing brushes to their skin care regimens.","“Having healthy skin starts with taking care of yourself,” she said, “Cleaning and exfoliating your face helps to remove the daily layer of pollution, sebum and sweat that have accumulated on your skin over the course of a day. Washing your face is the first step to removing the grime on the surface of your skin. Exfoliating, at least a few times a week, helps to get a little deeper, to really remove the layer of dead skin and any other products that are a bit more resistant.”","The Vanity Planet is water resistant, but not fully waterproof. You can use it in the shower, but it shouldn’t be submerged. This device has two speed settings, one for daily cleansing and another for exfoliation. You activate it and change the settings by pushing a single button, and it operates with two AA batteries, which are not included with your purchase. If you prefer rechargeable batteries, consider the Clarisonic Mia 2, the <a href=\"/conair-true-glow-review\">Conair True Glow,</a> the <a href=\"/clinique-review\">Clinique Sonic System</a> or the <a href=\"/foreo-luna-review\">Foreo Luna Mini 2</a>.","As with most facial cleansing brushes, you should replace the Vanity Planet’s brush heads after two to three months of regular use. You can buy replacements for $9.99 each or $19.99 for a three-pack. The Vanity Planet’s bristled brush heads showed wear more quickly than some of the other brushes we tested, but the wear seemed to be more discoloration-related than structural. We didn’t notice any wear with the device’s silicone head.","The Vanity Planet Ultimate Skin Spa has a one-year manufacturer’s warranty. If you need consumer support, you reach customer service by phone, email and live chat. The brush is available in is available in blue, purple and pink."]},"id":"4b759762-bdcf-4bbb-a179-7cbcfc718a3f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70243","url":"/vanity-planet-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-20T15:43:15Z","datePublished":"2018-09-20T15:43:15Z","name":"Vanity Planet Ultimate Skin Spa","synopsis":"The Vanity Planet Ultimate Skin Spa is a favorite among the rotating facial cleansing brushes we tested.","review":{"rating":80,"verdict":"The protective case makes the Vanity Planet Ultimate Skin Spa great for travel.
