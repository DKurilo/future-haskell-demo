When you try to visit a malicious site, Webroot displays a warning messing inside the browser that is hard to miss. And if it is a download, like a virus, Trojan or rootkit, the program blocks the entire website before it has a chance to start downloading. If you click on the Webroot icon on your browser’s toolbar, you can read more details of why a site was blocked, including any malware downloads that were stopped. For Microsoft Edge browser users, Webroot will still display warning messages for dangerous websites, but because Edge doesn’t allow third-party browser extensions, it is possible for malware to still download.","If a threat finds its way to your computer, the virus scan is able to locate the threats and remove them. We didn’t find a quarantine folder in any of Webroot’s internet security programs, but it does give you a detailed report of what its scans have found and what was done with the threat. We double checked after each scan and didn’t find any trace of malware, so we’re confident Webroot took care of them."]},"id":"6a747125-6bc5-4f91-8752-334c1e05441d","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/mgqsPftQZUrkJNL2Tj9xw4.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/579-webroot-internet-security3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mgqsPftQZUrkJNL2Tj9xw4.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"mgqsPftQZUrkJNL2Tj9xw4","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mgqsPftQZUrkJNL2Tj9xw4.jpg","alt":""},"id":"28df214e-d026-4cc3-8a7c-94ae84f404a0","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["On top of decent malware protection, Internet Security Plus and Internet Security Complete include a personal firewall that works alongside the Windows firewall.
