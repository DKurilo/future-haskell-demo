It&#39;s the best Mac encryption software for those functions, but the hardest to use. It has impressive encryption speed, but its decryption function may give you trouble.","R10Cipher specializes in encrypting simple text for SMS and email messages. You can encrypt document files on your Mac, but not entire folders like more advanced programs can. Because of this, R10 moves quickly. It can encrypt files up to 500MB, and it encrypted our 134.5MB test file in under eight seconds. It uses the same window to encrypt and decrypt the hidden text, so there&#39;s no wait time to decrypt messages.","Text, files and emails in R10Cipher use Blowfish 384-bit to encrypt messages. This algorithm is less complex than AES 256-bit or 128-bit, AES being the gold standard used by the U.S. government, but it can suit your needs if you keep most files on your computer.","R10Cipher is the only program we encountered that can encrypt text for email and SMS messages. While this is useful for corresponding, your recipient can&#39;t decrypt the message unless they have R10Cipher on their Mac. R10Cipher never actually decrypted any of our test files. Instead, it spat out the same garbled encryption from the beginning of the process. This earns R10Cipher a 30 percent score for ease of use, the lowest in our lineup.","You can apply batch encryption by simply dragging and dropping files into the software. You can protect individual files and your database with passwords. If remembering all those passwords seems intimidating, you can use the key management features to keep track of all your passwords. You can decrypt any of the files in your collections by double-clicking them and unlocking them with the master key. You can send encrypted emails to users on Mac, PC or Linux as long as your recipient has the correct password to decode them.","R10Cipher has a password strength meter and a password generator. The password strength meter tells you how strong your current password is, while the generator creates others. Though you can find these password tools online, it&#39;s useful to have them on hand when working closely with your files. A feature that this software lacks, however, is a file shredder, which would greatly boost the security by overwriting your deleted files to make them unrecoverable.","This is a tricky program to use, but the website has the essentials to assist you with any problems. You can reach customer support through email. There is also a FAQs page and user manual available on the website. R10&#39;s developers are based in the United Kingdom, so it may be a challenge to receive help over the phone, though the number is available for all customers."]},"id":"7d8d97f8-383c-4717-8e84-c5c9186cbf31","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"754672c8-a745-4b09-85c2-16f3beb51e01","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We encountered a mix of good and bad qualities while testing R10Cipher.
