Cable used to be king, connecting you with all of your favorite shows. Today, there are many other ways to get your TV fix, making cable a sometimes unnecessary expense. Whether you&#39;re trying to simplify your expenses or you&#39;re just not watching cable as much as before, it might be time to make the breakup call. Neil Sedaka once sang that &#34;Breakin&#39; up is hard to do,&#34; but giving your cable company the boot is only hard if you don&#39;t follow the steps to do it right.","<strong>Step One. Try a test run.</strong> You might think that you can live without cable, but you&#39;ll never know unless you try. Declare a cable-free week in your home and find other ways to stay entertained. Using online services like Hulu, streaming services like Netflix and even installing a <a href=\"/best-tv-tuner-cards\">TV tuner card</a> or an old-school antenna can help you ease the transition. After a week of going cable free, you&#39;ll know whether your trial separation should lead to something more permanent.","<strong>Step Two. Read through your service agreement.</strong> Depending on the company you&#39;re working with, you might be locked into a contract. You definitely don&#39;t want to end your service if your cancellation fee is more than what you&#39;d pay to continue service until your contract is finished. For instance, if your cancellation fee is $150, add up how much you&#39;d spend on your monthly cable bill until you can break the contract without a fee. You can then either wait until your contract is finished to make the call or bite the bullet and pay the fee.","<strong>Step Three. Prep the call.</strong> Pour some wine and turn on some Alanis Morissette, because it&#39;s time to make a heartbreaking call. Before you pick up the phone, know that, like a bad girlfriend, your cable company is going to do just about anything to beg you to stay. It&#39;ll be easier if you&#39;re prepared. Make sure you have your account number and your most recent bill on hand before you call so you can get through it quickly and avoid moments of weakness.","<strong>Step Four. Decline the offers   if you want.</strong> When you call to cancel, your cable company won&#39;t let you go without a fight. It&#39;s much easier to retain an old customer than to get a new one, so don&#39;t be surprised when the customer service rep begins offering you free subscriptions, better pricing or even credits. Weigh the options carefully; don&#39;t get trapped into a longer contract because you might get HBO for three months. Accept the offer only if it comes without strings and you&#39;re sure you can cancel when the promotional stuff ends.","<strong>Step Five. Send back the stuff.</strong> If you&#39;ve finally cut the cord and finished a neat break up, you might need to send back your rented cable equipment, especially if the company charges you to keep it. A rented DVR could cost a couple hundred bucks to keep, so it&#39;s definitely worth the $7 to send it back. Once the equipment is gone, you can dust the relationship off your hands.","In the months after the breakup, make sure that you pay attention to your bills and charges. Unless you&#39;re expecting a cancellation fee, your financial obligation should end once the billing cycle does. After sending off your last payment, you&#39;ll be a free person who can watch internet shows, stream movies and use your smartphone for entertainment without feeling like you&#39;re cheating on cable."," "]},"id":"dc39e721-8c94-46b1-ad7d-5ddb15e7b979","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7395","url":"/5-steps-to-breaking-up-with-your-cable-company","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-curtis","url":"/author/j-curtis","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.
