You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","We’re a little sad to see <strong>Babelgum</strong> so far down in the list, even though we stand by the rankings, just because it has such a fun interface. When other <a href=\"/best-internet-tv-sites\">Internet TV sites</a> required us to download a special player, we groaned.","So you can imagine how unexcited we were when Babelgum prompted us to download its own video player before we could watch videos. But as soon as we started using the Babelgum player, we stopped complaining because it is so intuitive and convenient to use. It allows you to navigate Babelgum, find videos, play them and adjust your settings all in one place. It really made us think twice about the burden of using site-specific video players. Ultimately, we’d still prefer if a site would just start playing our videos without the need of a download, but Babelgum came awfully close to making us change our mind.","The real reason why Babelgum ranks so low in this review is due to its content. Babelgum has a wide variety of content but much of it is just clips. Additionally, there are very few shows available that Americans would recognize, unless you’re a fan of the BBC.","When you visit Bablegum, you can find plenty of full episodes, but they are interspersed with an awful lot of clips. You’ll have to do quite a bit of sorting and searching if you want to watch something longer than 5 minutes.","Another problem for some people is that there aren’t very many shows available that you’ll recognize. The majority of the shows are from the BBC network and the rest are from networks that people outside of Europe won’t recognize.","Having said this, there is still plenty of entertainment available on Babelgum. You can find comedy, drama, action and just about every other type of show. Just because you don’t recognize many of the shows doesn’t mean that a little exploring won’t lead you to new shows that you’ll like just as much.","As we mentioned above, Babelgum requires you to download a special video player, a feature we didn’t like in other Internet TV sites. But the Babelgum player is so well designed and easy to use that it ceases to be an annoyance when the installation is done.","The Babelgum player can be fullscreen or minimized to a small player in the corner of your screen, making it possible to watch videos while doing other things. And the Babelgum player makes it possible to find new videos and alter your settings, all in one place. You can also interact with the Babelgum community directly through the video player, rating, sharing, commenting and modifying your playlist while you watch.","Babelgum easily gets the best marks in this review for advertising because the ads are so unobtrusive. You won’t find any video ads interrupting your videos (hallelujah!). Babelgum is the only Internet TV site in this review that doesn’t have them. Instead, Babelgum uses some modified image ads. There are a few small images on the left side of the player promoting other videos, but they go away while you watch. Then, every once in a while, a little white man walks in on the bottom of the screen. The first time we saw it, we thought it was part of the show. But then the little man displayed a simple image ad for a few seconds and walked off the screen.","We really love this advertising scheme because it is far less annoying than the interrupting video commercials. It just works.","The Babelgum player makes it easy to do everything from the viewing pane. You can rate, comment and share videos with other people. But you can also add videos to your playlist and interact with the Babelgum community.","Babelgum actually has pretty good options if you need tech support. There is the standard FAQ for simple questions, and a handy user guide for helping you understand all the features you have at your disposal.","You can also get help through email support, and the user forum is actually quite useful because other users can offer advice."]},"id":"d7c6f95b-5567-4c3f-94f3-8932d96794ba","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4c897507-bba9-4989-8974-e64a9c662014","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Babelgum has a fun interface that is easy to use, making it much more convenient to watch your favorite shows.
