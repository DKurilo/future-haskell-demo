You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The MG International Swim Alert <a href=\"/best-pool-alarms\">Pool Alarm</a> hangs over the deck on in-ground pools and monitors the pool to sound an alert when anything over 18 pounds enters the water. The model offers easy installation because you simply set it on the ground and leave one end in the pool, for low-profile pool safety.","This pool alarm is easy to set up because it self-calibrates to its environment. You simply turn it on and put it in place and the alarm will adjust automatically to your pool. For this reason, you should make sure that any filters, pumps, or fountains are running during the first 10 minutes of setup. While the model is small, the sensors are prone to giving false alarms due to oversensitivity, and may work poorly in a very large pool. The maximum recommended pool size is 20 x 40 feet, and you can install it in pools that are significantly smaller without problems.","It also features AquaSensor technology, which attempts to reduce the number of false alarms due to wind or falling debris such as leaves or twigs. A remote transceiver allows you to hear the alarm up to 200 feet away from the pool. Because the in-pool alarm is only audible for 100 feet, remote alarm is a very important feature if your house is not right next to the pool. The 100-decibel alert is almost the same volume as a car horn and is clearly audible around a yard or from a porch.","The alarm is tamperproof, which makes it ideal for using with older children because it requires a magnetic key to arm and disarm. Taking it out of the pool or attempting to turn it off without the key will set off the alarm, so children cannot turn it off at the pool. A wireless transceiver goes in the home and features a battery and operation light. This alerts you when the battery low or the sensor isn&#39;t operating properly. These both serve to update you if the pool alarm is no longer functional. The alarm runs on four D batteries, and run time varies depending on how many times the alarm is sounded.","The Swim Alert pool alarm is not as accurate as many comparable systems, which is a definite disadvantage because it is a high-end model. However, it does offer several unique features including a magnetic key, making it a good choice for families with older children who might try to tamper with the alarm."]},"id":"e06f454a-9eee-4479-a65b-7a819109b4ff","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63620","url":"/swim-alert-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-23T20:26:05Z","datePublished":"2015-03-23T20:26:05Z","name":"Swim Alert MG International","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-23T20:26:05Z","id":"nED7s9Jsmtrj3j4Wy4KYQ","meta":{"title":"Swim Alert MG International Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The MG International Swim Alert Pool Alarm hangs over the deck on in-ground pools and sounds an alert when anything over 18 pounds enters the water."},"products":[{"slug":"swim-alert-mg-international","url":"/product/swim-alert-mg-international","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:43Z","name":"Swim Alert MG International","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:43Z","id":"gNQM6tcy6NXXjo2Ssf28YL","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:15:43Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/RGowRiZSRunnwpi7QLa34f.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:43Z","mimeType":"","name":"63592-swim-alert-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63592-swim-alert-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:43Z","id":"RGowRiZSRunnwpi7QLa34f","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RGowRiZSRunnwpi7QLa34f.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Swim Alert MG International Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The MG International Swim Alert Pool Alarm hangs over the deck on in-ground pools and sounds an alert when anything over 18 pounds enters the water."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/RGowRiZSRunnwpi7QLa34f.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:43Z","mimeType":"","name":"63592-swim-alert-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63592-swim-alert-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:43Z","id":"RGowRiZSRunnwpi7QLa34f","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RGowRiZSRunnwpi7QLa34f.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Swim Alert MG International Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The MG International Swim Alert Pool Alarm hangs over the deck on in-ground pools and sounds an alert when anything over 18 pounds enters the water."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/family/best-pool-alarms/swim-alert-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:43Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:43Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"pool-and-hot-tub","url":"/home-and-garden/pool-and-hot-tub","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:43Z","name":"Pool & Hot Tub","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:43Z","id":"Snsyvysc6JMsPB5BLBFHBh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
