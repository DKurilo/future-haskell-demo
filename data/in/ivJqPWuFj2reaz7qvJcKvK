It has decent functionality as a fully articulating, manual-focus web camera, but it does have some obvious shortcomings – most noticeably its lackluster audio and video quality, and an overall lack of features.","While the best webcams on our lineup, like the Logitech HD Pro C920, can shoot in 1080p at 30fps, the GUCEE HD96 tops out at 30fps in 720p. This is technically high-definition, although the lowest resolution with that label, and the video quality seems to struggle to get even to that level. It may not consistently shoot at that frame rate or resolution, and you may need to lower it to get a smoother video. However, for its low price, the web camera is a decent option, especially for kids or anyone who is fussier about budget than specs.","Despite being labeled as a high-definition PC camera, the HD96 cannot shoot high-definition still images. It takes 2-megapixel photos, which is among the lowest still-image quality of any webcam we reviewed. Calling it HD is a bit of a misnomer, as it can only barely retain that resolution in videos.","Focusing is all manual on this camera, so you’ll have to adjust it any time you move out of the camera’s focus area. You tune the focus by twisting the ring around the lens. This shouldn’t be something you’ll have to do very often, however, as webcams tend to have a pretty deep depth of field. If you would prefer to have autofocus, be sure to check out some of the better cameras in our review, like the HP HD 4310.","The design of the GUCEE HD96 is aesthetically pleasing. The body of the webcam is plastic, although its sleek design makes that hardly noticeable. The base is metal, and has rudimentary adhesive padding that will prevent it from scratching your monitor or tripod. The range of motion for the camera isn’t great, but you are afforded basic pan-and-tilt functionality.","The HD96 ships with a basic one-year warranty from the manufacturer, which is standard for this kind of product. You can contact the company directly to ask questions, or you can peruse the user manual that comes with the webcam for other troubleshooting."]},"id":"41e3142b-3a3c-48cf-9684-12d2ffd6cc97","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"da654b64-8465-4e92-904d-1b7dfcdc7bfd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The iRush GUCEE HD96 is an inexpensive webcam that offers basic functionality.
