The iGrill2 has a wireless range of 150 feet, which is long enough for you to go inside or lounge by the pool while waiting for your food. Some grill thermometers, however, have ranges up to 300 feet, giving you even more freedom to roam.","This wireless grill thermometer supports up to four probes, with two probes included in the set, which means you can insert probes in various spots of the meat. For instance, if you are grilling a whole chicken, you could put one probe in the breast and another in the leg. If you are juggling multiple probes, you can set individual alarms to go off at specific temperatures or set temperatures that you don&#39;t want the thermometer to exceed. This is perfect if your family members like different levels of doneness for their steaks. <br/>The grill thermometer works fantastically with a smoker as well, but you&#39;ll want to purchase the ambient temperature probe separately. The probes have a 48-inch cord, which is plenty long for most grills.","The iGrill2 is quite accurate, even though it isn&#39;t an instant-read digital meat thermometer, meaning you&#39;re supposed to leave the probes in the meat while it cooks. Weber, the manufacturer of the iGrill thermometers, claims this thermometer is accurate within 1 degree Fahrenheit, which we found to be true in our grilling tests.","Using the presets, we had no trouble grilling a steak to perfection. We grilled four steaks, each to a different level: rare, medium rare, medium and medium well. The thermometer took an average of 16.25 seconds to fully register, which is shorter than most in our lineup take. It&#39;s also capable of measuring a wider range of temperatures than most grill thermometers can – -22 to 572 degrees Fahrenheit."]},"id":"f61def4b-e68e-4642-8a75-8ca95dc4c98c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"1b8cb920-e8b8-4f85-9cba-4c257355be6c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/VoC3ooi5bRpBt8FZMiFJ43.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The base station for this thermometer is slightly larger than a hockey puck.

The base and the probe are water-resistant, so they&#39;re fine if they get wet from the rain or if juices get on them. The thermometer and probes are not waterproof, though, so you can&#39;t put them in the dishwasher.","Pairing the iGrill thermometer with your smartphone is incredibly easy. It only took us a minute or two after downloading the Weber app. The app has a nice user interface and offers grilling recipes and tips. You can also share your temperatures and photos of your food through social media, text message or email. The iGrill has a default tweet that you can use when you post your pictures: &#34;Hey iGrill, do you? Check out what I&#39;ve been cooking!&#34; followed by the hashtags #iGrillDoYou and #iGrill.","As for more important and useful features, like alarms, these too are easy to schedule right within the app. When an alarm sounds, it is easy to disable.
