You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Waring Pro Countertop Double Burner is a great choice to give you an extra cooking surface in your kitchen. The double-burner <a href=\"/best-hot-plates\">hot plate</a> comes in handy to help cater to a crowd. The flat surface and brushed stainless steel housing will go along with modern, or practically any decor.","The Waring Pro DB60 has a larger burner plate that features 1,300 watts of power and a small burner plate that has 500 watts for quick heating. The larger burner, with a diameter of about 7 inches, is best used for quick cooking or simply boiling some water. The small burner, with a roughly 6-inch diameter, is suited for simmering or warming. Both plates are cast-iron, and the electric hot plates feature separate adjustable thermostats and indicator lights. The two burner plates can be used at the same time.","Weighing in just over 12 pounds, this dual burner hot plate isn&#39;t the most portable, but its heavy-duty construction makes it possible to take it out of the house and you don&#39;t have to worry about it getting beat up. It measures 19.5 x 11.5 x 4 inches, so it doesn&#39;t take up too much counter space. The hot plate burner has a power cord that is a little more than 35 inches long, so you shouldn&#39;t have trouble reaching a power outlet. It also has nonslip rubber feet, making it sturdy.","This two burner electric hot plate is certified by the National Sanitation Foundation and it heats up quickly. Its uses range from frying to canning vegetables. Since the burners are sealed, you don&#39;t have to worry about cleaning under them. You can a damp sponge or cloth to easily clean of the unit – just make sure to wait a little while before cleanup since the burners take some time to cool down.","The Waring Pro DB60 has a solid and heavy-duty build. Its cast iron plates warm quickly and the heat can easily be adjusted on each plate. If you are looking for a visually appealing double burner hot plate to entertain, use around the holidays, or provide an extra burner or two, this is a good choice."]},"id":"69c32589-6fdb-439e-a045-7ca8687c13a5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59931","url":"/waring-double-burner-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-07T17:52:11Z","datePublished":"2014-07-07T17:52:11Z","name":"Waring Pro Countertop Double Burner DB60","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
