Our research focuses on which types of cameras are best for beginners. We chose to focus on indoor cameras, since inside is the best place to put your first one. Each camera we tested connects via a mobile app and Wi-Fi. We specifically focused on fixed cameras with a wide field of view, at least 80 degrees, so they can monitor an entire room from a corner.","We also researched ways to test the cameras in real-world scenarios, rather than relying on confusing technical benchmarks. We hold each camera to the same standards and test them in similar conditions. We use the data from our tests to find the different strengths of each camera and to inform our recommendations.","<strong>How Much do Wireless Security Cameras Cost?</strong>","You can expect to pay around $150 on average for a wireless home security camera, though you can find products for as low as $25 (Wyze Cam) and as high as $350 (Nest Cam IQ Outdoor). Most Wi-Fi security cameras under $100 come from generic brands, which may have shorter warranties and fewer features than products from established brands such as Nest, Samsung, Netgear, D-Link and others. You can also expect to pay for local or cloud video storage. Local storage is essentially a microSD card, which is generally a one-time purchase, while cloud video storage costs an average of $5 a month or $50 a year.","À","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Video<br/>For daylight video tests, we wrote on a poster and placed it 16 feet away to compare each camera&#39;s indoor video quality. We used two lighting settings: natural light with the lights on and natural light on its own. We found the video was often better with the lights on than with natural light alone. The <a href=\"/flir-review\">Flir FX</a> and <a href=\"/foscam-review\">Foscam C2</a> had the best results with lights on. In low-light conditions, the <a href=\"/nest-cam-review\">Nest Cam Indoor</a> and the <a href=\"/dlink-review\">D-Link DCS-2630L</a> were better.","Aside from overall daytime video quality, we also looked at each camera&#39;s picture clarity. Predictably, higher-resolution cameras yielded the best results in this test, with 1080p cameras showing greater detail than 720p models. The Flir FX, D-Link DCS-2630L and <a href=\"/netgear-review\">Netgear Arlo Q</a> had the clearest video among 1080p cameras, while the <a href=\"/belkin-review\">Belkin NetCam HD+</a> was the best among 720p cameras.","We concluded testing by evaluating how well each camera handled motion. The D-Link DCS-2630L and the Netgear Arlo Q recorded movement well, while the other cameras had at least some lag and image distortion. Internet speed can affect lag, so motion is often worse on live video feeds, while recordings have fewer problems than live streams.","Nighttime videos use infrared light instead of visible light, so they don&#39;t match the color or detail of daytime videos. Therefore, we assessed the brightness of the nighttime picture instead, with brighter video producing more detail. The top nighttime security camera was the Belkin NetCam HD+, which illuminated our room better than other cameras.","Audio<br/>Our audio tests took a simple approach:we listened for loud, understandable audio. Some cameras were loud but the audio was distorted, while others cameras lacked distortion but were too quiet, making it harder to hear activity. The Foscam C2 was the only camera we tested with no audio distortion. Built-in speakers on each camera we tested, except the <a href=\"/ycam-review\">Y-cam Indoor HDS</a>, let you use the mobile app to talk to anyone near the camera.","Ease of Use<br/>To test ease of use, we tracked setup issues and whether we had to contact customer support. Cameras that quickly connected to Wi-Fi and had simple setup steps scored well.The <a href=\"/samsung-review\">Samsung SmartCam HD Pro</a> had the easiest installation. Next, we looked for useful smartphone apps that show recordings, live streaming and basic settings on the first screen you see. The apps from <a href=\"/oco-review\">Oco</a> and D-Link were the easiest to use.","Connection<br/>Our final test evaluated the Wi-Fi connection. To do this, we connected each camera to our Wi-Fi network along with a <a href=\"/best-internet-tv-sites\">video streaming service</a> and a <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a>. If a camera had connection problems, while the other devices and the <a href=\"/best-wireless-routers\">router</a> still worked, we deducted points accordingly.","<strong>Other Things to Consider When Buying a Security Camera </strong>","Video Storage: Local or Cloud?<br/>There are two kinds of storage, local and cloud, neither of which had any effect on our scoring because it boils down to personal preference. The cameras with local storage in our review use micro-SD memory cards to save video footage. This lets you access your video without subscription fees, though you might need extra memory cards or to write over older footage if you plan to keep your camera recording at all times.","Cloud storage holds more video than local storage, but there are often subscription fees. You typically don&#39;t need a subscription to view a live feed. However, if you can&#39;t reach the company&#39;s video servers, you can&#39;t access the recordings. On the other hand, cloud storage is easier to use than local and is more likely to record everything the camera sees. The Y-cam Indoor HDS is the only camera in our review with free cloud storage.","Field of View<br/>If you choose a camera with a very wide field of view, at least 160 degrees, you can expect to see every part of the room in front of the camera. The widest field of view in our review is the D-Link DCS-2630L at 180 degrees. A wide field of view, which the majority of the cameras we reviewed have, is anything larger than 80 degrees, and it works best if you mount the camera high in a corner that overlooks the room.","Digital Zoom<br/>Digital zoom allows you to select part of the video and enlarge it. While this helps you get a closer look at something, the quality of a digitally enlarged video won&#39;t match that of the original. The Samsung SmartCam HD Pro has the highest digital zoom in the review at 10x.","Smart Home Platform<br/>Before you buy, check if any <a href=\"/best-home-automation-systems\">home automation</a> or <a href=\"/best-diy-home-security\">DIY home security systems</a> work with the camera. These systems can use Wi-Fi security cameras to control <a href=\"/best-smart-locks\">smart locks</a>, <a href=\"/best-programmable-thermostats\">thermostats</a> and other devices in your smart home. Likewise, these devices can tell the camera to record or not, based on your personal preferences.
