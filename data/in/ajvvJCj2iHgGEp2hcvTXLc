It features an HD camera capable of recording in multiple formats and sizes. While suitable for sports and other occasions where sunglasses are typically worn, this <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-action-cameras,review-3046.html\">wearable camera</a> isnâ€™t the best choice for everyday use.","This wearable camera features an 8MP CMOS sensor for capturing photo and video in both low- and high-light conditions. The 77-degree field of view is small, especially for filming sports, but it still allows you to record point-of-view video. It is capable of taking photos that are between 3MP and 8MP and features several modes, including a burst mode and a time lapse mode, which takes up to one photo per second.","The wearable camera records video in NTSC and PAL formats with a maximum of 60 frames per second, depending on the settings you choose. Configurable auto on and off settings allow you to set the camera to turn on at specific intervals, such as every five minutes, to take a photo. The buttons on the side of the sunglasses allow you to configure settings and choose your preferences, but with no screen, this can be difficult.","A one-hour battery life limits what you can capture with this wearable camera, especially considering that the battery must be recharged and cannot simply be replaced. This makes it less suitable for athletes participating in skiing, hiking or other adventure sports. The storage space is also relatively small. It contains only 8GB of memory, and you cannot expand this with a memory card. However, with the short battery life, this isn&#39;t as much of a problem.","Its video syncs directly to your computer using a Mini-USB cable, but does not offer any preview or mobile syncing. With no mobile control, you get few additional functions.","With a short battery life and a design that isn&#39;t suitable for everyday use, the Pivothead Kudu is not for everyone. The life camera does blend in well, and the sunglass design also allows it to protect your eyes while outdoors, which is good for sports and other outdoor events."]},"id":"b7ebffa9-cf1e-426f-a218-670414306472","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64257","url":"/pivothead-kudu-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-21T19:34:51Z","datePublished":"2015-04-21T19:34:51Z","name":"Pivothead Kudu","synopsis":"The Pivothead Kudu life camera comes in several colors and is housed in a pair of sporty sunglasses.
