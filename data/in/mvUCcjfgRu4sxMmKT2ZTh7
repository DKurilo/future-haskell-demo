designed this laptop knows you never get a second chance to make a first impression: We were wowed when we took this machine out of the box. The model we tested is dark navy blue with a shiny finish our reviewers couldn&#39;t help but ooh and ahh over. It smudges so it&#39;s not the best option if you&#39;ve got little ones with eternally sticky fingers, but it sure is pretty. It&#39;s also one of the lightest <a href=\"/best-home-computers\">home computers</a> we tested, weighing in at 2.7 pounds – the same as the <a href=\"/dell-review\">Dell XPS 13 9370</a>.","This laptop has a perfectly acceptable 13.3-inch 1080p touchscreen. That means it works for young kids who want to play hands-on games as well as more mature members of the household who want to browse Amazon and Instagram. We watched some videos and thought a lot of the colors appeared dull compared to some computers we reviewed. The display put out 296 nits of brightness in our tests, which is slightly better than the category average. This laptop isn&#39;t built with professional graphic artistry in mind as it&#39;s considerably dimmer than the top-ranked <a href=\"/apple-imac-21-5-inch-review\">Apple iMac</a>.","The Dell we tested came with an Intel Core i5-8250U processor with only 8GB of RAM. It doesn&#39;t work well as a mega gaming machine but can absolutely handle running several applications and browser tabs at once. In the Geekbench performance test it got a score of 12,999, which is far better than the average score of comparable laptops. The Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics card also works well, running games smoothly in our tests. With all of this you get more than nine hours of battery life on a charge slightly better than the other home computer laptops we tested.","On the outside of the ZenBook 13 you get an extraordinarily mediocre webcam, so don&#39;t plan on using it to take any award-winning selfies. The touchpad is large and responsive though, and the keyboard didn&#39;t give us any problems. There’s even a snazzy little fingerprint reader for faster sign-on. The left side of this pretty blue laptop houses the charging slot, HDMI port, USB 3.0 and Type-C port. The right side has a slot for a microSD card, headphone jack and second USB 3.0 port.","This isn’t a bad laptop but it lacks some of the power and performance-enhancing features other models have. It also costs quite a bit. This ZenBook could still work as a home computer for you or your family if you want something portable that can get you online, store photos and multitask."]},"id":"f8024ce0-4abc-4647-a3dc-1bd59b475973","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69670","url":"/asus-zen-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-10-24T16:29:07Z","datePublished":"2017-10-24T16:29:07Z","name":"ASUS ZenBook 13 UX331UN","synopsis":"Whoever designed this laptop knows you never get a second chance to make a first impression: We were wowed when we took this machine out of the box.
