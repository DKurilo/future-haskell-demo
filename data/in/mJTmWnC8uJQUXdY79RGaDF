The Wilson Electronics MobilePro is a little different from some of the other <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-boosters\">cell phone boosters</a> this company offers because it is much easier to set up and use. Instead of using an internal antenna for boosting the signal, the booster itself acts as the antenna. This eliminates the need for additional cords, but at the same time, it limits the benefits of the improved signal for backseat passengers in a car equipped with this signal booster.","Much like other Wilson Electronics boosters, the MobilePro uses multiple frequencies to ensure that you are able to capture and amplify even the weakest signals. To further increase your signal, the Wilson Electronics MobilePro has an average gain of around 40dB, which is well above average."]},"id":"ee668b28-e2f2-42d5-b4c9-2d2a827c748b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Signal Boosting Performance"},"id":"00e99644-1477-4c01-9dc1-441f7f100e87","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Being able to receive increased reception while on the road is necessary if you hit dead zone after dead zone during everyday travel. The Wilson Electronics MobilePro utilizes an average gain of anywhere between 40 and 42dB to retrieve the most powerful signal possible. Gain works by taking the signal or frequency that is already out there and amplifying it to increase the reception your cell phone receives. The frequency used on this cell phone booster works on all generations of CDMA, GSM, TDMA, GSM and 3G frequencies. Since all of the most popular providers use these, you should have no trouble picking up a signal for your phone no matter which service provider you use.","Wilson Electronics has a variety of cell phone booster models ranging from cradle or wired models that require a phone connection to wireless boosters. The Wilson Electronics MobilePro and other models we reviewed are all wireless, which gives you much more freedom than cradle models do. Unlike many of the wireless models we reviewed, the MobilePro only uses one device for transmitting the boosted signal. Many other models use a separate booster and antenna, which gives you the freedom to place the antenna at different locations on your car. The MobilePro makes up for its lack of antenna-location options with its ease of installation and use."]},"id":"6934ed3c-13a9-485b-b0a4-c1f04621d071","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Installation Features"},"id":"853bb35f-a40e-4ecb-ac5a-da5d208b2975","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Like many other companies and pleased customers, we found the overall quality and performance of the Wilson Electronics MobilePro very satisfying. It doesn’t matter if you hit dead zones while traveling to and from work or if you simply live in a rural area; regardless, the MobilePro will significantly boost your cell phone signal. One thing we were pleased to see is that this cell phone booster is capable of taking even the weakest signal (no bars) and bumping it up to something you can work with. If you travel through a canyon and hit dead zones, or if you simply have no service at all, you will find that the MobilePro should provide a strong signal in at least some places along the way.","The majority of users choose to place the Wilson Electronics MobilePro on the dashboard since the booster comes with a holder. However, if there are multiple people in the car who want to use it, you can choose to place it in any location in the car as long as it is stable. By placing it on the middle console, everyone in the car should be able to utilize this amazing little device. Whenever you move the external antenna, you will also need to move the booster to make sure you receive the best signal possible."]},"id":"99c811c5-49ad-4e11-a8e9-df8d0e92dca5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Antenna Features"},"id":"6b6a4cea-3ba1-49c3-afc1-9141781da980","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Wilson Electronics MobilePro is one of the easiest cell phone boosters to use of those we reviewed.

The cell phone booster comes with a connector for the air vents and additional connectors can be used for the seats.
