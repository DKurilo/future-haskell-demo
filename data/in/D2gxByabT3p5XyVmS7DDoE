Plans and prices are comparable to other <a href=\"/best-prepaid-cell-phones\">prepaid cell phone carriers</a> we evaluated, but the limiting data speed caps enforced on all Cricket’s plans make it a less desirable option. Cricket is a good choice if you’re looking for a wide range of plans and don’t need the fastest speeds. It is one of the only prepaid carriers we found that offers both unlimited data and no-data plans.","<strong>Network</strong>","<a href=\"/gophone-review\">AT&amp;T</a> is one of the Big Four wireless networks in the U.S. The others are Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. Cricket makes use of AT&amp;T’s network coverage and reliability, which are both good on a national average. Though the AT&amp;T network performs decently well in network speed tests, Cricket plans all have a data speed cap. For most plans, the cap is 8 Mbps, though the cheaper of the two unlimited plan options caps data speeds at 3 Mbps.","For comparison, in nation-wide network speed tests performed by our sister site, Tom’s Guide, AT&amp;T had an average download speed of 22.1 Mbps while Cricket came in at 6 Mbps. If you’re not frequently downloading large files, the 8 Mbps cap shouldn’t affect streaming music or using social media if the network performs well in your area. We recommend checking the provider’s coverage map as well as third-party coverage and network performance maps any time you’re thinking about switching providers.","<strong>Plans</strong>","Cricket offers five plans, all with unlimited talk and text. You can opt for no data, 2GBs, 5GBs  or from two tiers of unlimited data. The range of plan options is excellent, as most prepaid providers we reviewed either had unlimited options or data-less options, but not both. The basic talk and text plan costs $25 a month, and the top-tier unlimited plan costs $60. These prices are comparable to other well-known MVNOs but come with fewer features. Both hotspot tethering and unlimited music streaming that doesn’t count toward your high-speed data are add-ons with Cricket. With limited data plans, you can top up on extra data if you find yourself short in the middle of a billing cycle, but any unused data doesn’t carry over.","<strong>Carrier Feature/Extras</strong>","Cricket has a good selection of phones available through its website. You can also bring your own phone if the device is compatible with the network, anything from AT&amp;T or T-Mobile should be fine. You can add up to five lines on a single plan, and plans that cost $40 per month or more are eligible for autopay and multi-line discounts.","Though it isn’t the fastest option, Cricket Wireless offers a wide range of options to fit everyone in your family. Though there are better options for super heavy data users, Cricket has great plans for people without smartphones or minimal data-users."]},"id":"10ea077a-ef2e-40d9-a5c8-3c37f7a25edf","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3113","url":"/cricket-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-05-19T15:25:52Z","datePublished":"2009-05-19T15:25:52Z","name":"Cricket","synopsis":"Cricket Wireless is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) owned by AT&T.","review":{"rating":84,"verdict":"Cricket Wireless is a competitive budget carrier with great coverage thanks to AT&amp;T&#8217;s network.","pros":["Cricket offers inexpensive, data-less plans."],"cons":["The cap on data speeds is very limiting."]},"strapline":"Cricket Wireless is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) owned by AT&T.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-06-27T00:00:00Z","id":"D2gxByabT3p5XyVmS7DDoE","meta":{"title":"Cricket Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Cricket Wireless is a competitive budget carrier with great coverage thanks to AT&amp;T&#8217;s network."},"products":[{"slug":"cricket","url":"/product/cricket","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:07:02Z","name":"Cricket","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:07:02Z","id":"enJvdc2RurSyybXA57eYQA","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-05T14:07:03Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/7Ab5j4Fhri8echhuJg7UGQ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:07:02Z","mimeType":"","name":"fc244acd28730de8bd56d36fed438373.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/fc244acd28730de8bd56d36fed438373.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:07:02Z","id":"7Ab5j4Fhri8echhuJg7UGQ","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Ab5j4Fhri8echhuJg7UGQ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Cricket Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Cricket Wireless is a competitive budget carrier with great coverage thanks to AT&amp;T&#8217;s network."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/7Ab5j4Fhri8echhuJg7UGQ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:07:02Z","mimeType":"","name":"fc244acd28730de8bd56d36fed438373.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/fc244acd28730de8bd56d36fed438373.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:07:02Z","id":"7Ab5j4Fhri8echhuJg7UGQ","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Ab5j4Fhri8echhuJg7UGQ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Cricket Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Cricket Wireless is a competitive budget carrier with great coverage thanks to AT&amp;T&#8217;s network."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/mobile/phones/best-prepaid-cell-phones/cricket-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:07:02Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:07:02Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"mobile","url":"/electronics/mobile","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:07:02Z","name":"Mobile","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:07:02Z","id":"LWfuBdpYombsbwBKLD65DE","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
