The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/hvac/best-electric-fireplaces/\">Electric Fireplaces</a> here.</em>","The Classic Flame Transcendence electric fireplace has two heat settings to heat a room up to 400 square feet, but its Btu output is on the low end, so it may take a bit longer to heat a living space than higher-ranked units.","The two heat settings allow you to set the unit between 62 degrees and 82 degrees Fahrenheit to keep the room at a desired temperature or to keep it always on. The unit has a Btu capacity of 4,600 and uses 1,500 watts to operate.","You can even use the fireplace and experience the ambiance of the flames without the heat. The rock insert bed has a realistic look, and the LED flames are vibrant. You can adjust the color and brightness of the flames too, which is a fun feature. The color options are amber, blue, amber and blue, color cycling, and no color.","This unit also has a timer that you can use with either heat setting. This function lets you set the timer for 30 minutes to nine hours, and the fireplace automatically turns off after the set time.","The fireplace weighs 35.2 pounds and measures 40.39 x 19.37 x 8.66 inches making it a bit wider than most on our lineup, but that just means you&#39;ll likely want to mount it on a longer wall in your living area rather than a shorter wall. It requires a minimum of 36 inches clearance if you mount it above or below a television or near any furniture, which is a standard clearance among electric fireplaces.","This electric fireplace includes a few different convenience features. For instance, you can operate it with the touchscreen controls in front or with the included remote control. Another feature is its automatic shut-off. The fireplace automatically shuts off if it gets too hot. This ensures that the unit doesn&#39;t become a safety hazard.","You can install the unit on a wall quickly and easily with the included mounting hardware. In case you don&#39;t want to mount it on the wall, it also includes a base stand, which allows you to set it on top of a mantle or a sturdy stand.","This Classic Flame electric fireplace has a one-year warranty, which is the standard coverage on electric fireplaces. For help and support, you can contact the manufacturer by email, but not by phone, which is disappointing because this would be preferable when you need answers quickly."]},"id":"ef2aa831-a4d0-4af0-bb98-950b010f16c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5d042a69-2a39-4e32-997c-3e3622013dc8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Classic Flame Transcendence electric fireplace heater can warm a room up to 400 square feet, and you can even set it to heat to a certain temperature.
