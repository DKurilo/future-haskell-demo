The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/home/laundry/best-front-load-washers/\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Kenmore 41373 front-load washer has a 3.7-cubic-foot washtub, which is slightly smaller than many we reviewed but it will still handle a good-sized load of laundry at once. This washer bares the Energy Star label and even has some nice energy-saving features like its Cold Clean wash cycle that uses tap cold water to conserve energy.","According to its EnergyGuide, it’s estimated to only cost you $12 annually to operate. Additionally, it is estimated to consume 111-kilowatt hours a year, both of which are fairly low.","You get 10 wash cycles and six wash options with this Kenmore front-load washer. We were specifically impressed to see a specialty kids wash cycle available. The Kids Wear specialty cycle is designed to work hard to remove stains and other soils that kids tend to get on their clothing. It finishes the wash cycle with a second rinse, ensuring that no detergent remains on the laundry and helps protect the sensitive skin that kids can have.","We also liked seeing this front-loader washing machine have a steam option included. The Steam Treat option adds steam to the wash cycle to help remove tough stains without you having to pre-treat the stain before throwing it in the wash.","This Kenmore front-load washer sits at 38-15/16 inches in height, is 26-1/4 inches wide and is 30-1/3 inches deep when the door is closed. You can opt to add the optional pedestal drawer for an additional cost. This makes the appliance be at a more convenient height so you won’t be bending over to put laundry in.  This model is available in dark gray, red and standard white colors.","We are not a fan of the warranty coverage Kenmore offers with this front-load washer; you only get one year of coverage overall. Many front-load washing machines will come with additional coverage for the appliance motor and washtub but Kenmore fails to deliver here.","You can contact Kenmore for help and support via phone, email and even live chat. However, in order to get help and support via email, you must first submit an online contact form through the Kenmore website. You can also find the product’s user manual on the Kenmore website for reference."]},"id":"823babcb-e55a-4524-b398-0ef458b6a8f7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5e18374c-3263-44f4-a7ce-86922c7ca6fb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore 41373 front-loading washer doesn’t boast too many fancy features, but does have the necessary features needed to tackle a lot of laundry.
