There&#39;s also an embossing tool that works on paper, cardstock, chipboard and even soft metals. The engraving tool punches holes and distresses a variety of mediums including plastic, metal, glass, soap and even leather. The engraving tool has a diamond tip, which means you can cut precisely and for a long time. The Silver Bullet uses Sure Cuts A Lot software, which is easy to use. It also syncs with apps, including with Make The Cut. The machine is rather cumbersome and large though, so it&#39;s not very portable.

You can insert a pen for drawing patterns or add a blade simultaneously so it draws the pattern first, then cuts it. You select which material you&#39;re cutting with a dial and the machine automatically adjusts the settings. If the material you&#39;re using is not quite paper but also not quite fabric, there are half settings to pick from as well. Old cartridges from other Cricut products work in this die cutter, and you can also use the company&#39;s free online software to find premade templates. Some are free but some you have to buy. The Cricut program can even take a JPG and turn it into a cuttable image. This machine isn&#39;t very portable as it lacks a built-in handle, but it&#39;s not too unwieldy or heavy.

This determines how well the machine can cut through a given material, leaving clean lines or only scored edges.","While the main purpose of die cutters is to cut, they can also pierce, some engrave and emboss, as well as draw premade or custom designs. The lower the pressure, the better the die cutter is for thin material. Some die cutters have a low cutting force, making them ill-suited for tough materials like leather but a good fit for cardstock and other paper. We awarded machines with high cutting forces, 900 grams of force or greater, higher scores because those that use less pressure aren’t as versatile.","<strong>Ease of Use</strong><br/>While all die cutters are easy for most crafters to use, we took into account each machine’s weight, the setup and software installation process, and the overall ease of operation. We also considered whether the die-cutting machines come with the required software, as well as if they are compatible with the most common stand-alone software for die cutting. If the machine can be operated without the use of software, we gave it the same score as if it had software included.","Cutting width also impacted our ranking of the best die-cutting machines. All but one machine in our review has a cutting width between 12 and 15 inches, which is ideal for scrapbooking pages and wide enough for most other materials. Die cutters with narrower cutting widths limit the size of letters or images you can cut.","<strong>Support Resources</strong><br/>The best digital cutters have quality customer service behind them. These machines take some getting used to, even if you have used other die cutters before. The best manufacturers provide easy access to customer reps through telephone, email, FAQs and tutorials. If you&#39;re new to crafting, the best die cutters come with online copies or prints of ideas and patterns.","<strong>Die-Cutting Machines: What Makes the Cut?</strong>","It can be difficult for quilters, scrapbookers and crafters to make precise cuts on fabric, paper and other materials. Handheld tools like hobby knives and scissors can be unwieldy and tedious for large or complex projects. If you find yourself frequently cutting small, intricate pieces or you need many pieces of a similar shape, you may want to consider adding a die-cutting machine to your crafting kit. These machines come in a variety of sizes, with different prices, power levels and capabilities, which can make it hard to choose the right one for your needs.","Die cutters work best for cutting cardstock and paper across the board, but tougher models can cut low-strength materials. Even the simplest die cutters can cut and emboss, but more advanced models can draw, print, weld and scan. If you&#39;re the crafty type, check out our reviews on other crafting supplies like <a href=\"/best-sewing-machines\">sewing machines</a> and <a href=\"/best-digital-scrapbooking-software\">scrapbooking software</a>.","<strong>Die-Cutting Machines: How to Choose</strong>","There are several criteria to consider when selecting a die-cutting machine. Die cutters come at a wide range of prices; they can be simple rolling presses or advanced models that print, scan, cut and more. Because of this, consider how frequently you craft, as well as how detailed and customized you want your designs to be.","<strong>Design Flexibility</strong><br/>While all the machines we reviewed allow you to adjust blade depth, pressure and cut speed, keep an eye out for additional settings like piercing and embossing. Die cutting machines with pierce features can punch through materials to create patterns or designs, and those with emboss features can press patterns into materials to create a relief.","<strong>Automatic vs. Manual</strong><br/>Both automatic and manual die cutters work well with a variety of materials, so the type of machine you choose really comes down to convenience and what you plan on using it for the most. Manual models are composed of a rolling base connected to a side crank. You turn the crank and the base moves like a conveyer belt under the die cutting press and blade. With these models, you put paper under metal dies that press or cut designs into the paper or foam.","Automatic models are like printers or scanners. Your materials sit on a sheet of light adhesive paper to keep them stable while the die-cutting blade carves your designs. More advanced models let you create designs on a computer, then send them to the cutter. While it is common to use these machines for cutting vinyl lettering and paper for scrapbooking pages, today&#39;s machines can do much more, such as engrave and emboss a wide variety of materials like sheet metal, fabric and leather.","<strong>Material Types</strong><br/>Die cutters are often used for labels, stamps, stickers, card pieces, quilting and scrapbooking. The best die cutters can create delicate lace patterns that are extremely difficult to cut with a knife or scissors. Each piece of paper or cloth you insert into the die cutter should return with your design cut neatly and uniformly.","Depending on the projects you like to work on, pick a die-cutting machine that cuts the type of materials you use most. The most common materials are paper, vinyl and fabric, but some die cutters can also cut materials such as rubber, fiber, foil, cloth, fiberboard, paperboard, plastic, foam, leather and even sheet metal. Quilters need more advanced die cutters to handle fabrics of different textures and thicknesses, while scrapbookers can get by with most models.","<em>Contributing Reviewers: Rebecca Spear &amp; Anna Burleson</em>"]},"id":"c7fcd8ec-bbd1-4a1b-82b0-a508b3ac5c16","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"32576dbf-ac50-41a0-a626-6bf22244c4e8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://thatsscrapinc.com/13silverbulletprofessionalseries.aspx\">Silver Bullet</a>","<a href=\"http://knkusa.com/product/zing-orbit-15in/\">KNK Zing Orbit</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OCEBHD4/?&tag=ttr_die_cutting_machines-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|825[art|NA[pid|52574[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Pazzles Inspiration</a>","<a href=\"http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=993649&U=113582&M=51766&afftrack=DieCutMachine\">Cricut Explore</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D06LG8A/?&tag=ttr_die_cutting_machines-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|825[art|NA[pid|67764[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Silhouette Curio</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V9AL07C/?&tag=ttr_die_cutting_machines-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|825[art|NA[pid|66006[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Brother ScanNCut</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NAX7H8M/?&tag=ttr_die_cutting_machines-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|825[art|NA[pid|54083[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Silhouette CAMEO</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IXFMH2S/?tag=ttr_handcrank_radio-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|731[art|NA[pid|52587[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sizzix eclips</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"f8ccbc7e-fb9c-43fe-b287-89783ce75a35","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_825","url":"/best-die-cutting-machines","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-04-18T16:24:46Z","datePublished":"2017-06-30T22:34:04Z","name":"Best Die Cutting Machines","synopsis":"We've spent over 35 hours testing nine different die cutters to determine which were the easiest to use and created the most intricate and precise cuts.","review":{},"strapline":"We've spent over 35 hours testing nine different die cutters to determine which were the easiest to use and created the most intricate and precise cuts.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","id":"rEszMTbtu2Djf6S3yFA7oN","meta":{"title":"Best Die Cutting Machines of 2019 -
