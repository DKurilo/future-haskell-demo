It’s not quite as nice as the more expensive 4K devices we tested, but it does a great job nevertheless. The device itself is small and lightweight.

Unfortunately, the LG player isn’t very fast when it comes to streaming services. It sometimes took 30 seconds or more to start a movie on Netflix during our tests.

Below is a list of criteria to consider when looking for the best Blu-ray player for your home entertainment system.","<strong>Build Quality &amp; Usability: Easy Interfaces &amp; Scrolling</strong>","As home theater hardware, Blu-ray players aren&#39;t nearly as performance-tied as product families like smartphones or tablets. Still, ease of use plays a vital role in what makes the best Blu-ray player.","In our evaluations, we measured the performance of each player in several areas. Factors like cleanly designed interfaces and quick loading speeds were strong points for our top rated Blu-ray players. If you want to adjust settings, like audio sources and subtitles, you don&#39;t want to scroll through submenu after submenu. Similarly, we factored in the boot time of each Blu-ray player on stock settings into our ratings. While boot time was only one of several data points we used – many players have quick-start settings that allow for instantaneous power on times – it can be an indicator of player performance in secondary areas.","Qualitatively, we evaluated the design and build quality of each player and its accessories. While these specifications are secondary to player performance, they still play a strong role in daily use. Poorly designed remotes or players with low-quality bodies can be an inconvenience.","<strong>Connectivity: Cables, Cables &amp; Cables for Your Player</strong>","Home theater setup can often quickly devolve into a mess of cables for various devices, but top Blu-ray players manage to work around these issues. Before making a purchase, consider your current home television and the cable types it needs to function. Do you want the player to use component or HDMI cables for connectivity? What audio standard does your home theater use if you have a secondary audio source? If you plan to use the player as a dedicated multimedia hub, do you want a USB port on the player?","In addition, internet connectivity is an important feature for most home users. Along with allowing streaming apps to function, internet connectivity allows your Blu-ray player to download updates when needed. Most budget players will only have an Ethernet jack for physical connections, but higher-end models include Wi-Fi support.              ","Our hands-on testing is designed to simulate typical, real-world experiences with Blu-ray players. For our tests on evaluated players, we obtained review models through a combination of retail purchases and units provided by manufacturers. The manufacturers have no input on our testing methodology, and our rankings are not shared with them prior to publication.","<strong>Blu-ray Players: What Else Is Important?</strong>","<strong>Features by the Numbers: 3D &amp; 4K Support</strong><br/>For most home users, Blu-ray players that provide basic high-definition playback functionality will be enough. However, higher-end and mid-range models increasingly provide features that were previously only found in premium models.","4K is a display standard that refers to media that plays at a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels and possesses higher image quality than traditional high-definition content. TVs with 4K support display content at this higher resolution. 4K compatibility on Blu-ray comes in two formats: Players with native support can play 4K content by default, while players with upscaling simulate a 4K image from a standard high definition source. Image quality on upscaling players will be usable on a 4K television but won&#39;t be comparable to native 4K content.","3D support is also a similarly commonplace feature on most non-entry-level Blu-ray players. In order to take advantage of either feature, you&#39;ll need an HDTV that has 3D or 4K support.","<strong>Streaming Apps</strong><br/>It can be a hassle to bounce between multiple electronic devices, especially when you add streaming services on top of them. Whether you’re trying to build the perfect home theater, or simply want to streamline your existing setup, getting a Blu-ray player with Wi-Fi capabilities is one way to make things easier. A good Blu-ray player can connect to the internet and allow you to access video and music streaming apps – and it should support DLNA streaming in case you want to use the player to access your folder of downloaded videos and music.","A Blu-ray player with media apps allows you to switch between your physical Blu-ray collection and videos from popular streaming sources like Netflix, HBO, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video. This isn’t a necessity if you already have a standalone streaming device, like Apple TV or Roku, though it may be nice to have streaming access regardless of which device you are using.","Having DLNA streaming support is also a plus if you have your own home media server. If you use Plex or a similar service, you can play your cherished video collection through your compatible Blu-ray player without having to change devices.","It’s worth noting that if you want to stream 4K content through your Blu-ray player, you’ll need to have a compatible television and a good enough internet connection in order to properly support it. In most cases, budget Blu-ray players won’t have all, or even some, of these features. We recommend opting for a mid- to high-end player so that you have all of these options available to you whenever you’re in the mood to watch some movies.","<em>Contributing Reviewer</em>: Brandon Carte"]},"id":"9c63e6da-5d68-4cc6-9add-c81dd79cf2f4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"8d9734b1-42c4-478f-8aa6-02a9fb91699d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BTTHXZU/?&tag=ttr_blu_ray_player-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|668[art|NA[pid|56803[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sony BDP-S6700</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UBD-K8500-UBD-KM85C-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B01M3NXNFR?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Samsung UBD-K8500</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/BDP-S6500-Blu-Ray-Player-FiberTique-Cleaning/dp/B06XD47VTC?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Sony BDP-S6500</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-BD-J5900-Curved-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B00TKOSUMW?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Samsung BD-J5900</a>","<a href=\"https://www.frys.com/product/8402228?lk_pricespider\">LG BP550</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FWKIGFS/?&tag=ttr_blu_ray_player-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|668[art|NA[pid|56806[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Philips BDP7501</a>","<a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1120696-REG/lg_bp350_blu_ray_disc_player.html/BI/8236/KBID/8940/kw/LGBP350/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xLGBP350/SID/blu-ray players\">LG BP350</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LH1NA62/?&tag=ttr_blu_ray_player-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|668[art|NA[pid|69015[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Magnavox MBP5630/F7</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"b48c019e-d514-438c-8edb-525daa63e785","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_668","url":"/best-blu-ray-players","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-knoder","url":"/author/jonathan-knoder","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jonathan Knoder","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"yRHneGGUztMrGu99zxra6M","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-05T21:49:08Z","datePublished":"2017-02-02T00:04:50Z","name":"Best Blu-ray Players","synopsis":"Crystal-clear picture, sharper colors and streaming internet video can be yours when you add a new Blu-ray player to your home entertainment system.","review":{},"strapline":"Crystal-clear picture, sharper colors and streaming internet video can be yours when you add a new Blu-ray player to your home entertainment system.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","id":"niDwvXmaUXNSpTohaKvxXV","meta":{"title":"The Best Blu-Ray Players of 2019 - Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
