You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","The Mirage Nanosat <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">5.1 home theater speaker system</a> is a unique pairing of five satellite speakers and a subwoofer. Unfortunately, there isn’t a dedicated center speaker within this speaker package. The subwoofer can reach a low 33Hz while the satellite speakers measure as high as 120kHz. The human ear is capable of detecting frequencies as low as 20Hz, so the bass doesn&#39;t quite provide perfect coverage, but it certainly provides enough to give your home theater system a respectable punch.","The lack of a dedicated center-channel speaker in this system is disappointing. A good center-channel speaker helps tie the surround sound together and keep your attention focused on the screen. Mirage does offer a matching center-channel speaker that can be purchased separately.","The Nanosat home theater speakers look awesome. Mirage has ditched the age-old box-style speaker cabinet for a unique triangular design instead. If the box didn&#39;t come labeled as a 5.1 home theater speaker system, you might not guess that they are speakers at all. They come with removable dome-shaped grilles, so it is up to you whether you leave them attached. The speakers look great either way.","The satellite speakers pack a lot of technology into a small space. They come magnetically shielded for starters, which keeps the speaker magnets from damaging your television or other sensitive electronics. They put out big sound from a small cabinet, and they do it with good clarity.","The bass and stereo speakers are well blended. It is important to note that these speakers will produce optimal results in a small to mid-sized room. The speakers produce big sound for the size, but the immersive sound stage will become less dramatic in larger rooms.","To round things off, this surround sound speaker package includes a 20-pound down-firing subwoofer just a bit larger than 13 x 11 inches. The subwoofer has an internal amplifier that powers the driver with 70 continuous watts of power but can handle an impressive 300 watts of peak power for cranking out booming low tones."]},"id":"33c25097-4d0d-4a46-a230-93135ce2eefd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0085c873-1e8d-42b8-aba1-bde092b1d7ff","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Mirage Nanosat 5.1 Home Theater System is a great option for your home theater speaker system, especially for a small to mid-sized room.
