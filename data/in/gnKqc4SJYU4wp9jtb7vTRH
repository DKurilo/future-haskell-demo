You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.","Smaller isn’t always better, but the Kobo Mini is one <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eBook reader</a> that aims to prove otherwise. This tiny, touch-controlled eReader delivers convenient features and unrivaled portability. The device also comes with a mini price tag, making it ideal if you’re on a budget or reluctant to commit to the ubiquitous Amazon ecosystem.","The Kobo Mini earns the distinction of not only being Kobo’s smallest eBook reader, but the smallest eReader currently on the market. Literally pocket-sized, the device fits snugly within the palm of your hand. It’s remarkably light (a mere 4.7 ounces) and comfortable to hold, so you won’t tire from a marathon reading session. Further enhancing the overall portability of the device is the built-in Wi-Fi; you can download books from the Kobo bookstore through any accessible wireless network.","This eBook reader is also surprisingly feature-rich, considering both its size and cost. Similar to other major eBook retailers, Kobo stores your eBook purchases in the cloud. This way you can access them, along with your bookmarks and last page read, on any device that has the Kobo eReading app installed. The Mini also offers adjustable text, an area in which Kobo is definitely king. You can customize your text with eight unique fonts in 24 sizes, and you can adjust the weight and sharpness settings. These options may seem inconsequential at first, but such an impressive range of control allows you to create the most optimal reading experience for you.","You will notice the Kobo Mini is lacking some options found on more expensive electronic readers. There is no built-in light for reading in the dark, and the Mini’s e-ink screen doesn’t offer as much contrast as the competition. The result is text that’s not quite as sharp as a higher-resolution eReader. The Kobo Mini also has a battery life of roughly 30 days, depending on your usage. It’s decent, but a far cry from the average two months some eReaders boast. We can hardly complain given the entry-level price of this device, but you may find it’s worth paying for these upgrades on a more full-featured eBook reader."]},"id":"27e39e31-8ee9-4b00-b5d9-cf0c11d6c9bf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"21ad4fa9-dbc7-4094-a300-63b9bede84ff","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ultra-compact design, useful features and appealing price tag of the Kobo Mini make a compelling argument in favor the eReader.
