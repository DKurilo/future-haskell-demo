You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Vision Fitness TF40 is a high-end <a href=\"/best-treadmills\">treadmill</a> that is available in three different versions: Classic, Elegant and Touch. The mechanical specifications are the same for all three versions and perform well against the best treadmills. With the Classic model, you get a basic console that has five workout programs and limited features. The Elegant and Touch consoles each add more features, such as a color LCD with touchscreen functionality and additional workout programs, but these cost you extra.","The performance features of the Vision Fitness TF40 Classic meet the standards of the modern treadmill. The 3-horsepower motor drives this treadmill to a maximum speed of 12 mph and a 15 percent maximum incline. The 20 x 60-inch belt is big enough for most runners. The weight limit for users is 400 pounds, which is better than the 350-pound weight cap of most treadmills.","When it comes to the features, the Vision Fitness TF40 Classic has a relatively lean selection. It includes only five workout programs, the fewest of any treadmill in our review. There are also no built-in fans to keep you cool while you exercise.","The programs included in the Classic model are intervals, weight loss, fitness test, target heart rate and manual. To use the target heart rate program, you can either use the handgrips or purchase a wireless chest sensor. The cushioning system helps you stay comfortable as you run, which is essential to building your endurance.","This motorized treadmill folds out of the way when you are not using it, but that&#39;s pretty much its only convenience feature. You can purchase add-ons or other consoles to increase the treadmill&#39;s functionality, but this can be very costly. Extras that you can add to the TF40 include speakers and an interactive video workout system to motivate you.","The Vision Fitness TF40 Classic has one of the better warranties in the treadmill industry. The frame, motor and cushion material are all covered by a lifetime warranty. In case you need to replace a non-electrical part, the manufacturer offers a seven-year warranty, which is two years longer than the average treadmill warranty. The console parts are covered for only five years. Labor is covered for a period of two years. You can contact Vision Fitness&#39; product support via email and phone. You can also download a PDF user manual and look through the FAQs section on its website to find solutions on your own."]},"id":"640d270e-7edd-4689-a315-5f03bccb306d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"16fe4513-73ae-4400-83c0-c26b02d7df0b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Vision Fitness TF40 Classic treadmill is a decent tool to help you reach your fitness goals, but it lacks some of the functionality of the best folding treadmills in our reviews. The customer support and warranty are nice additions to a good product, but perks like speakers, a wireless heart sensor and video workouts do not come standard with it. If you have a large budget, you can add more features, but the TF40 Classic on its own is a very basic treadmill."]},"id":"74d8f180-3c27-45ac-9f4e-96155c89b71c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58729","url":"/vision-fitness-tf-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-29T18:05:50Z","datePublished":"2014-01-29T18:05:50Z","name":"Vision Fitness TF40 Classic","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":82,"verdict":"The Vision Fitness TF40 is customizable and has a lot to offer, but the extra cost for most of its convenience features hold it back against the best treadmills.","pros":["It can incline up to 15 percent for a more intense workout."],"cons":["This treadmill only has five workout programs."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-01-29T18:05:50Z","id":"XeaZPYMbcBC3SbHQHZKHKg","meta":{"title":"Vision Fitness TF40 Classic Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Vision Fitness TF40 treadmill has some features that allow you to customize your workout.
