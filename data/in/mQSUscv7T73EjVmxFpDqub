The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-webcams\">Webcams</a> here.</em>","The HD 4310 is a well-rounded web camera that affords users the best in video specifications and an easy-to-use design. Although it doesn’t have everything you might expect out of a premium webcam, it’s a great option for those who need high resolutions, quick framerates and top-notch still shooting.","The video specifications of the HD 4310 are perhaps its strongest feature. There aren’t many cameras on our lineup that can boast the ability to shoot in 1080p at 30 frames per second. This means your video will be clear on most screens as well as smooth, avoiding the jerky look of low framerates. When streaming, this will of course be influenced by your internet connection.","Still image resolution is also impressive for the HD 4310. In fact, it’s the second highest on our lineup at 13 megapixels. Like all webcams with high megapixel counts, it achieves this by using interpolation. Interpolation is a process by which the camera uses actual pixels as a reference and mimics their information to add extra pixels with information not actually captured by the camera. Adding these pixels artificially increases the resolution.","Technical specifications are a great place to start, and from them we can assume that video from this webcam would be crisp and smooth. But that doesn’t always mean you’ll have great image quality. Often the quality of the lens and sensor can have quite an effect on how your video looks. Fortunately, the HD 4310 lives up to our expectations with well-lit and clear video that is free from distortions.","It’s audio quality, however, left something to be desired. It wasn’t terrible, but for its positioning as a premium webcam we just expected a little more. Our main complaint is that it sounds a little muffled with too many bass tones. Those aspects just make the experience a little less lifelike.","In addition to its solid video performance, this webcam also does well in the features department. It has autofocus with face tracking. This is the easiest and most accurate way to keep subjects in focus. In addition, the face tracking lets the camera know how to expose a shot and adjust settings like white balance in order to reliably produce accurate skin tones.","Surprisingly, this camera’s lens is made of plastic. This is one of the few complaints that we have about this webcam. Although it apparently doesn’t affect the quality of the video too much, plastic lenses are just not as durable or effective as their glass counterparts. If you already like the camera, it’s not a deal breaker, but you’ll just want to be a little more careful with how you clean and handle the lens.","HP offers pretty helpful support for the HD 4310. As a company, HP offers support via phone or email and there are further resources like FAQs and a downloadable manual on the website. For the webcam specifically, HP offers a one-year warranty. Webcam warrantees are typically one to three years long and protect you against any defects in materials or craftsmanship."]},"id":"d477eed6-6d39-4bde-9d2f-5ddb83420c03","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f9238b02-f224-48f1-a106-358ca37b64bb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP HD 4310 is a compact webcam that features full 1080p HD image resolution and many excellent features.
