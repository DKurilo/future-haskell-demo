For example, the best fridges have storage features like adjustable shelving, freezers, and doors with a can dispenser and a spot for a 2-liter bottle. We considered mini fridges in a fairly wide price range to accommodate the needs of students, professionals and families.","<strong>How We Researched</strong>","We spent 80 hours researching mini fridges. During that time, we talked to the manufacturers, pored over specifications, and read online blogs and consumer reviews to learn as much as we could. As we researched, we weeded out models that perform poorly, are exceptionally expensive and don’t use space as wisely as the 10 mini fridges we ultimately chose.","As we evaluated fridges, we relied on our own experiences as students, office workers and homeowners. We considered each model’s features, annual energy costs and specifications as well as the types and sizes of containers it accommodates.","<strong>How Much do Mini Fridges Cost?</strong>","Mini fridges vary substantially in price and can range from $70 to $300, and cost even more than that for deluxe models. The price is influenced primarily by the interior size you’re seeking, the quality and durability of the device, how flexible it is as far as reconfigurable shelving, and other factors.","<strong>Expert Advice</strong>","On her blog My Sweet Savannah, Melaine Thompson explains that buying a mini fridge made her life easier.","&#34;When we made our kitchen island bigger, one thing we added was a mini fridge. I love it and am so glad we did it! Here is why we love it: It&#39;s perfect in the summer when the kids come in from swimming, they can quick grab a drink. It&#39;s great for parties as an extra place to store beverages. It also frees up space in the main fridge. It is the perfect size for juice boxes.&#34;","In her article “My Mini Fridge Taught Me How to Cook” on the site A Cup of Jo, Stella Blackmon describes how her culinary skills have improved since she got a mini fridge.","&#34;The best part of a mini fridge? Nothing is wasted. There’s no casserole lurking in the depths of the freezer or bargain berries expiring under a pizza box. You can’t ‘accidentally’ forget about those bell peppers you’ve been ‘meaning’ to use. Seeing everything at once forces me to imagine the dinner possibilities (stir-fries, quesadillas, salads) I might have otherwise overlooked.&#34;","<strong>What to Look for When Buying a Mini Fridge</strong>","Flexibility<br/>Look for a compact fridge with a reversible door – that way, you have more options for where to put it. It&#39;s also useful to get a fridge with adjustable, slide-in shelves, as they allow you to store large food items.","Energy Efficiency<br/>Many top-notch mini fridges – including inexpensive models – are Energy Star certified and cost little to operate. Since most people leave fridges running all year round, the savings of an energy efficient model add up fast.","Good Freezer Space<br/>Some mini fridges have no freezers. However, it&#39;s nice to have some ice on hand for soft drinks, and it could be beneficial to have a few frozen microwave meals in your office or dorm mini fridge. You often see small, box-type freezers in mini fridges, but the best option is a full-width freezer."]},"id":"a40450a4-1b7e-4f6a-bbfc-a1f0af604d69","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"cd3b7571-a134-4e38-a958-c35dec29b31f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/haier-review\">Haier HC33SW20RB</a>","<a href=\"/magic-chef-review\">Magic Chef MCBR440S2</a>","<a href=\"/black-and-decker-bcrk25w-review\">Black &amp;
