The most powerful headphones in this series have 40-mm drivers and a wide frequency response of 3 to 28,000Hz. They produce quality sound straight out of the package, and the audio quality gets richer as you break them in. The headphones’ response control reduces distortion and creates a club-like sound in the middle of your living room.","While designed primarily for personal use, some of these Sony headphones have high power resistance, so you can use them with professional audio and DJ equipment without worrying about blowing them out. Of course, you should be cautious when playing music at extreme volumes, but you should be able to boost the volume to hear details over a dancing crowd or while mixing tracks.","All of the Extra Bass headphones have swiveling earcups that lie flat when not in use, which makes the headsets easy to store in a messenger bag or backpack. Sony also uses a flat, tangle-free cord, but it is extremely short at only 3.94 feet in length. If you plan to use the stereo headphones in this series in a studio or as you DJ, it would be wise to invest in an extension cable.","The cord has a convenient in-line remote and microphone, so you can take hands-free calls when your headphones are plugged into your mobile phone. The earpads are ultra-thick and fit comfortably for hours of listening. They also maintain a nice vacuum to keep outside noise from ruining your listening experience.","While some manufacturers include cases and accessories with their stereo headphones, Sony does not. Still, the company has good support. If you have problems with or questions about your headset, Sony’s comprehensive website has instruction manuals and FAQs, as well as warranty information. You can contact support directly by email or telephone.","The Sony Extra Bass series headphones boast impressive quality, a sleek design, great bass and comfortable earcups. They’re good headsets to consider if you play music from a portable device or use higher-end audio equipment, though you may need to purchase an extension cable."]},"id":"af353cf9-e300-466e-9d68-729f1276234c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55798","url":"/sony-mdr-v55-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-02-15T21:21:13Z","datePublished":"2013-02-15T21:21:13Z","name":"Sony Extra Bass Series","synopsis":"Sony's Extra Bass series stereo headphones are great for listening to music on your tablet, phone or MP3 player, and the DJ-style earcups swivel, so it’s easy for you to hold the headset with on","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Sony's Extra Bass series stereo headphones are great for listening to music on your tablet, phone or MP3 player, and the DJ-style earcups swivel, so it’s easy for you to hold the headset with on","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-02-15T21:21:13Z","id":"9TBuNtaX2dCTTsbqaUSJsP","meta":{"title":"Sony Extra Bass Series Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Sony&#8217;s Extra Bass series stereo headphones fold for easy storage, and the swiveling earcups make it easy to listen with just one ear.
