It weighs 38 pounds and has a 0.2-gallon holding capacity. The Noritz heats water on demand with natural gas but uses electricity for ignition, powering its electronics and preventing the internal components from freezing up. It comes with a basic temperature control, but you can get the optional remote control with a digital display. The heater uses a direct vent kit made from PVC or CPVC pipes, but you can also get a nondirect vent conversion kit if you prefer to mount the water heater on a non-exterior wall.","When active, this Noritz tankless water heater consumes 54 watts of electricity. However, its consumption rises to 138 watts when running in antifrost mode. In addition to connecting this heater to a wall outlet, you can also rig it to a battery backup to use it during power outages. It has an energy factor of 0.91, which is pretty high for a gas-powered water heater. It is also 93 percent efficient whether you use it with natural gas or propane. The heater has low nitrogen oxide emissions, but it does not quite meet the industry&#39;s standards.","Inside the Noritz, there are two heat exchangers made from commercial-grade copper that is 25 percent thicker than the regular copper used in gas tankless water heaters. Noritz covers these exchangers with a 12-year warranty. To make the heater durable, the manufacturer equipped it with safety features such as a flame sensor, overheating and lightning protection devices, freeze protection, a fan rotation detector, a condensate overfill detector and a temperature control lock.","The gas consumption ranges from 15,000 to 120,000 Btu per hour. This burn rate delivers a minimum hot water flow rate of 0.5 gpm and a maximum of 6.6 gpm, similar to the <a href=\"/ecosmart-review\">EcoSmart ECO 27</a>. However, this Noritz tankless water heater delivers this peak flow rate while it is raising water temperature by 30 degrees Fahrenheit. A 70-degree raise will only deliver half that flow rate.","With these flow rates, the Noritz can only serve a maximum of two showerheads or faucets simultaneously. During winter, it can only provide one low-flow showerhead with hot water. While it can heat water to temperatures ranging from 100 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, you can only choose three temperatures from the unit itself. The remote allows you to choose from nine temperature settings, but it is sold separately.","The Noritz NRC661-DV-NG is a gas tankless water heater for very small families. It burns gas efficiently but draws considerable electric power. It can barely serve two showerheads in all seasons, and the optional remote is too important not to include with the heater."]},"id":"9e9c23f1-a352-415d-8ac8-9cd24a3fe33e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65902","url":"/noritz-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-06-25T15:19:38Z","datePublished":"2015-06-25T15:19:38Z","name":"Noritz NRC661-DV-NG","synopsis":"The Noritz NRC661-DV-NG is a gas-fired, condensing tankless water heater for small homes.
