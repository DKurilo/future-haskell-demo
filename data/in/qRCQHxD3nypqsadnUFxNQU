Like other network-owned prepaid services, Visible benefits from direct access to its parent company’s network, and even more so since Verizon’s network is the best in the U.S. This makes Visible a good prepaid option for the majority of the country if only considering coverage. Visible isn’t the best for lightning-fast speeds, as the service limits data speeds to 5 Mbps. This is adequate for email, web browsing, social media and streaming in DVD quality, but it’s nowhere near Verizon network’s top possible speeds.","At the moment, Visible is still in its early access phase, which is an open beta test. You can get an invitation code from any Visible member, though a code is not needed to join Visible now. Early access comes with ambiguous special perks and privileges. The service anticipates a wider public roll-out of the service later this year.","Possibly because the company hasn’t been around long, Visible’s service is pretty limited. It has only one plan that costs $40 per month and offers unlimited talk, text and 4G LTE data. The price includes all fees and taxes. As mentioned before, the data speed is limited to 5 Mbps, but it does not have a high-speed data cap like most cell phone plans with unlimited data. It does let you use as much of your unlimited data plan toward mobile hotspot tethering as you want, though hotspot speeds are still limited to 5 Mbps. Like Verizon’s own prepaid plan, Visible’s plan data is deprioritized in times of congestion. This is inconvenient depending on where you live and how many people use the Verizon network near you, but it might also never affect your network speeds. It doesn’t offer multi-line family plans or the discounts that usually go with adding multiple lines to your service account.","One thing that differentiates Visible from other prepaid cell providers is that it markets itself toward millennials. It is primarily managed via its Android and iOS app, so you don’t have to deal with salespeople during setup. You contact customer support and pay your bills through the app as well, which accepts credit and debit cards, PayPal and Venmo.","Visible is compatible with most iPhones starting with the 6, the Galaxy S9 series and the Visible R2. The website’s FAQs promise that more phones are coming. If you have a compatible phone, you’re set to try the new service, but if not, Visible sells compatible phones and SIM cards and even offers financing. Most of the phones available in the store are smartphone flagships, but the Visible R2 is just $99.","Overall, Visible is a promising prepaid phone carrier. Its simplified offerings and streamlined, app-based service management cater to a specific demographic: namely single, younger people. But its lower prices and use of the Verizon network make it a viable option for a lot of the U.S."]},"id":"b30021d4-e2c3-4765-88fd-02fe571254b3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70355","url":"/visible-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-02-13T22:32:31Z","datePublished":"2019-02-13T22:32:31Z","name":"Visible","synopsis":"Visible is a prepaid wireless carrier owned and operated by Verizon Wireless.","review":{"rating":83,"verdict":"Visible by Verizon Wireless is a fledgling prepaid service with great coverage in the U.S. but is an otherwise limited plan.","pros":["Visible uses parent company Verizon&#8217;s expansive network coverage."],"cons":["Visible limits data to 5 Mbps and only has one plan."]},"strapline":"Visible is a prepaid wireless carrier owned and operated by Verizon Wireless.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-13T22:32:31Z","id":"qRCQHxD3nypqsadnUFxNQU","meta":{"title":"Visible Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
