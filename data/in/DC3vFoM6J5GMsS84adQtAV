This gas-fueled <a href=\"/best-slide-in-ranges\">slide-in range</a> has an oven that measures a serviceable 4.5 cubic feet. Its two oven racks and five rack positions offer less flexibility than the top-ranked slide-in ranges, such as our top pick, the <a href=\"/samsung-review\">Samsung NE58F9710WS</a>, which has three racks that fit into seven rack slots. But the Frigidaire’s five rack slots enable enough flexibility to accommodate large baking dishes and other items that need sufficient space for baking or roasting.","The oven gives you even heat distribution, and its quick-preheat function works in less than 6 minutes. It also has an auto-shutoff function that turns off the oven after 12 hours, a safety lockout feature and a timer. If you need to leave the house but want to begin baking an item at a certain time, you can set the delayed-baking feature as far as 24 hours in advance.","The oven window is exceptionally large so you can see what’s happening with your soufflé without opening the door and risking your creation’s collapse. The lower drawer does not work as a warmer but is useful for storing cookware. The self-cleaning oven uses heat to burn away messes, leaving ash that you simply wipe away after the cleaning cycle finishes and the oven cools. You can choose a 2- or 3-hour cleaning cycle,  and you can set a delayed-cleaning function to begin its work while you’re away.","This Frigidaire model’s cooktop features durable cast-iron grates that let you slide heavy pots across them rather than lift the pots to move them from burner to burner. While some electric ranges’ ceramic cooktops limit your cookware options, you can use any type of pot or pan on this gas range’s burner grates.","The left front and rear burners each provide 9,500 Btus for general cooking. The right front burner reaches 15,000 BTUs for some serious heat to bring liquids to a fast boil, while the right rear burner goes to 5,000 Btus for simmering.
