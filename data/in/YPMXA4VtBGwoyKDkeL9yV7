You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Of all the <a href=\"/best-learn-french-software\">learn French software</a> products we reviewed, Unforgettable Languages French has the least amount features and learning tools. In fact, when we reviewed the software, we were astonished that anyone would pay for it. Purchasing an audio CD with vocabulary drills would be more effective.","Using Unforgettable Languages French is quite simple. Each screen is text showing a French word, its English translation, a mnemonic device designed to help you remember the word and a sound file that gives you the proper pronunciation of the word.","For example, &#34;The French word for Horse is Cheval. Imagine a Horse digging with a Shovel.&#34; The software stresses that you imagine the mnemonic device for at least ten seconds in order to retain the information in your gray matter.","After about a dozen of screens like this, the learn French software quizzes you on the vocabulary words you just learned. The tests are as simple as the drills. A list of French words is provided, as well as a bank of blank fields for you to type in their English translations. The software then provides the correct translations for you to compare your answers to.","All this is simple to a fault; frankly, it seems like little more than a dictionary program with clunky mnemonic devices that are of questionable value. This learn French software lacks nearly every ranking criterion we looked for when we rated and ranked the best French lesson applications.","Furthermore, the look and feel of the interface is beyond simple. To call it dated or antiquated would be an understatement. The entire program is simply text on a blank background. There are no images, videos or any visual elements beyond text whatsoever. This has the effect of making the mnemonic devices, which already feel lazy, even weaker.","If this software had anything more than what it offers, even if it were a picture of a horse digging with a shovel, it would make it infinitely more usable. As it sits, it&#39;s hard to imagine anyone gaining any usable knowledge from the software."]},"id":"17571cb8-21e7-45f4-ad57-18b6a3499565","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4ab1bfbd-733a-467c-80ff-9d4eebd447f0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re going to spend money on French lessons, you&#39;d be best advised to avoid Unforgettable Languages French.
