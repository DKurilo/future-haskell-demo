The feature most people will notice first is the 4.3-inch screen, which is substantially bigger than most handheld units on the market.","Equally important to its size is the fact that the picture is a clear, high-resolution image that lets you see exactly what your baby is doing. Intricate remote pan and scan capabilities enable you to follow your baby to every corner of the room and zoom in on their activities at any time of the day or night.","Another striking feature is the 750-foot transmission range, which outshines most of the competition. In the average household, that will allow you to continuously monitor your baby from anywhere in the house or yard without losing transmission strength.","The rechargeable battery for the Stella camera lasts for up to 36 hours in PEEP (Power on/of Energy Efficient Picture) mode and eight hours in regular mode, which substantially lengthens the time between charges.","The two-way-talk feature lets your baby know you are there. Soothing your baby from the next room can often be convenient for you and reassuring for your baby. This feature, while not exactly common, is becoming more so, and it&#39;s something many people recommend because it turns a monitoring device into an interactive tool.","The ability to upgrade to four cameras is another nice feature that increases the Stella&#39;s usefulness and versatility, eliminating the need to purchase additional monitors. As your family size increases, you may need more cameras.","Omissions such as the lack of a nightlight and a room thermometer make this monitor slightly less versatile than it would be otherwise. While these omissions are relatively minor, they will no doubt be important to some parents.","Levana has great customer support. The company&#39;s live chat operators are very helpful, and email and telephone support is also available if that is more convenient. The company also has useful online support, with FAQs and online PDF manuals that will answer many of the questions you may have."]},"id":"64dad9cd-5429-45d9-b9bb-097c7f7ba894","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1a719f21-6085-4367-be61-858465cb985e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Levana Stella remains competitive with the top-rated baby video monitors on the market, with a feature set that sets it apart from much of the competition.
