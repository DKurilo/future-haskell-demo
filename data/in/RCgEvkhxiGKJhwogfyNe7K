Although personal investment and additional tax options are not provided in this personal finance software, we believe the financial calendar and other budgeting tools make this money software ideal for those just beginning their financial quest.","This personal finance software allows credit limits and notifications to be set and sent when budget items exceed the limits you have placed on your accounts. This feature is a great way to know when you are reaching and exceeding your budget set for entertainment, shopping or gifts, which with $10 here and $20 there, can be extremely easy to do. By using these limits and notifications, keeping your spending habits under control will be manageable.","Every day, your updated budget including all bills, direct deposits and other expenditures can be translated to the financial calendar. Add reminders for when bills are due or notes explaining purchases. The calendar can be printed directly from the personal finance software to be displayed on the refrigerator or at a desk.","BudgetExpress generates reports according to your actual planned budgets and are illustrated with easy to read graphics. Pie charts divide each spending category into monthly or annual percentages based on your total net worth.","Contact and support tabs located on the upper right-hand side of the page are easily found by navigating to the BudgetExpress website from your web browser. From this point, click on the contact tab, which will immediately connect you to Microsoft Outlook, generating an email with support&#39;s email address. Within the personal finance software there is a reference library that will be of great use.","BudgetExpress is able to back up all data and budgets and keep all financial information protected with a password that users must enter every time they open their budget documents.","Although boasting some great features, BudgetExpress does not have any features dedicated to importing investment account data, maintaining a portfolio manager, or downloading stock quotes or stock history.","This money software does not have a dedicated tax section, but having access to detailed pie charts and line graphs illustrating yearly expenditures will be helpful when preparing tax papers and other information."]},"id":"7a6db01e-584c-4f9a-b108-08b9b0d83ccd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"47994619-3c60-45a0-a9a4-02baaf2aad9b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This personal finance software may not boast a lengthy list of banking, reporting and bill features, but for the features this money management software does possess, we feel BudgetExpress will get the job done â€“ saving your money and keeping your financial goals in check."]},"id":"62770acc-1391-4063-847d-fdbe2fc22b3f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_839","url":"/budget-express-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"lori-fairbanks","url":"/author/lori-fairbanks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Lori Fairbanks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"p6N3q9MSBBLsV6BQ4Qpsyc","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","datePublished":"2018-05-24T19:02:32Z","name":"Budget Express 4","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
