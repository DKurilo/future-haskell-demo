Even though the LG INFINIA 55LE8500<strong> </strong>isn’t the latest and greatest model LG has released, it&#39;s still in the running thanks to its stacked feature set, great picture quality and high performance without the high price tag. Unlike the LG 55LX9500, which offers the new 3D technology, the 8500 is only available in the standard 2D. While this may seem like a major drawback, it really isn&#39;t; 3D technology is still in the works and has many issues that still need to be worked out. We would suggest holding off on 3D technology for the time and waiting until it gets perfected before purchasing a 3D-capable LED TV."]},"id":"7f9fa9b7-687b-4794-8d6a-4c5a43bfbc4f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Display"},"id":"7fe5f774-3031-48ca-98f0-951111b611a3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG INFINIA 55LE8500 really does shine in a variety of areas, the first being the ultra thin 1.4-inch thick display, which makes it perfect for hanging on a wall or simply for putting it in an entertainment center. It also features a one-sheet glass design which gives the TV a look of being one large piece, even though the glass is separate. This means the 55LE8500 LED TV looks good from any angle. As with any good electronic product these days, the 8500 series comes with all of your internet apps and widgets; these include YouTube, Netflix, Vudu, Picasa and a host of other things to keep you up to speed with anything and everything.","One thing that LG really does well is allow you to change a variety of display settings so you can get the perfect picture no matter where you place your LED TV. The LG INFINIA 55LE8500 shows how this can be done with a handful of options for just about any setting. The only real major flaw with this LED TV is that it doesn&#39;t have the ability to stream audio, which means you will have to use YouTube or some other widget for this feature. It also lacks the ability to view 3D video which at the moment is not a huge ordeal, but in the very near future could bring this TV down quite a bit."]},"id":"60da4a59-b9b0-4fb7-a518-66601bc23c6e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"354794ab-b46c-488c-85a4-25c41a023762","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The display on this LED TV is both one of its strongest points and one of its weakest.

If you plan on putting this LED in a living room or other well-lit area you may want to rethink your decision. LG designed this LED TV with a glass front that reflects a lot of glare, which is always annoying when you watch TV during the day or while the lights are on.
