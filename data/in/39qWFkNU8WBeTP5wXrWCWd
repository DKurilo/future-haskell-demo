The Snow Joe is optimal for snowfalls of up to 10 inches and handles light, fluffy snow as well as moderately wet snow with ease. You need to plug this snow thrower into a wall socket though. Snow Joe recommends you use a 100-foot cold-rated extension cord. A benefit of using an electric snow blower is that it weighs much less than a gas-powered blower. The Snow Joe weighs just under 34 pounds, which is about the weight of 4 gallons of water. Electric snow throwers are much lighter than gas-powered ones and are easier to turn and push.","Fortunately, electric <a href=\"/best-snow-blowers\">snow blowers</a> provide an eco-friendly and maintenance-free way to clear the snow from your home. While having a cord trail behind you may take some getting used to, you will never have to worry about starting your engine or breathing in noxious gasoline fumes. The SJ623E runs much quieter than a gas-powered blower, so you don&#39;t have to worry about disturbing neighbors early in the morning.","One of the most important features of any snow blower is the width of the clearing path. The wider the clearing path, the fewer passes you have to do on your driveway or sidewalks. The Snow Joe has a generous 18-inch clearing path and can throw snow up to 25 feet away. The discharge chute rotates a wide 180 degrees. While this isn&#39;t the lightest blower on our lineup, pushing a 34-pound snow blower is about as easy as pushing a lightly loaded shopping card.","The powerful 15-amp motor powers four rubber blades attached to the steel auger. Having a steel auger provides strength and support to the blades, allowing the SJ623E to handle heavier snow. While some electric snow throwers use a thermal plastic auger and blades, Snow Joe&#39;s steel auger is more durable and lasts longer, which can cut down on maintenance costs.","The auger also helps you push the blower by providing a gentle forward motion as it scoops up the snow. This is a great feature, especially if your driveway has a slope. Unfortunately, you cannot adjust the handle length or position. However, this snow thrower has an average-length handle, so even if you&#39;re tall, you shouldn&#39;t have to hunch while using it.","You can use the Snow Joe SJ623E on your deck or patio without worrying about destroying or marring any surface. While the auger blades are strong and powerful, they are also gentle.","The best electric snow blowers have easy-to-use controls that are within reach. To start the Snow Joe you simply have to press a button while holding the auger safety lever and you can start plowing. You can rotate the discharge chute with the crank. This allows you to continue to remove snow without stopping the blower to adjust the chute direction.","This machine has a bright 20-watt halogen headlight on the front of the snow blower, making it easy for you to see while plowing in the dim light of early morning or evening. One of the most dangerous hazards of any snow blower is clearing out a clogged discharge chute. You should never use your hands to clear out a jam. Fortunately, the SJ623E comes with a specialty clearing tool. This extra feature can save your fingers this winter.","Snow Joe handles all warranty and service issues through its company. The website has many resources for snow blower owners, including support through email or by phone. You can also order replacement parts online, such as replacement auger blades, scraper bars and more. You can also download an owner&#39;s manual on the product page if you ever lose or misplace yours.","The snow blower comes with a limited two-year warranty that covers manufacturer defects or broken parts that result from normal use. Unfortunately, Snow Joe does not have authorized service centers or providers beyond the company, so you have to contact them directly if you have questions or problems with your electric snow thrower.","Because it weighs less than 34 pounds, it is easy for anyone to maneuver the Snow Joe. The wide 18-inch clearing path and 25-foot throwing distance help reduce the amount of time you have to stay out in the cold. Using an electric snow blower can make your winter more enjoyable and save you the aches and pains of shoveling."]},"id":"32b2e2b2-5d5f-430a-bd6c-1fc33f228768","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61187","url":"/snow-joe-sj623e-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-13T21:39:34Z","datePublished":"2014-11-13T21:39:34Z","name":"Snow Joe SJ623E","synopsis":"The Snow Joe SJ623E is one of the best electric snow blowers available due to its power, maneuverability and reliability.
