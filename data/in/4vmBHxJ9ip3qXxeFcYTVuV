You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","At 19.6 cubic feet, the Whirlpool EV209NBTN is one of the smaller <a href=\"/best-freezers\">upright freezers</a> in our lineup. And although smaller, it ironically costs the same to run, $71, as other freezers with a capacity of 20.1 cubic feet. The size is made manifest by the limited number of shelves: three inside, four in the door and two baskets. We think the limited capacity is due largely in part to the split contour design. Because the freezer is split in half, a thick plastic divider separates the top and bottom-half, and the bottom consists of one large tub instead of hosting shelves or pull-out bins. We think this setup would make it harder to find buried items. Luckily, the Whirlpool EV209NBTN is equipped with an interior light to assist you in your frozen food search.","Perhaps in future models Whirlpool will implement exterior temperature controls, but right now all of their upright freezers have internal controls, the Whirlpool EV209NBTN being no different. We don’t like this design because in order to check the temperature of the freezer, you have to open up the door, letting cold air out; however, we do like that a door ajar monitor will alert you when the door is left open or if the temperature rises above a set number. An exterior power on light is another convenient signal of whether your freezer is working correctly. This upright freezer also comes equipped with features like Fast Freeze and Frost Free, and it is ice maker ready. You do have to purchase the ice maker separately, but Whirlpool is the only brand that makes this feature possible in their upright freezers.","Although this freezer may be smaller in capacity than others, its height (67 inches), depth (32 inches) and width (30 inches) are comparable to other, larger upright freezers. We find this interesting because with just a few more inches, the Whirlpool EV209NBTN’s competitors are able to hold up to another cubic foot of food. If the height needs to be adjusted, two front leveling legs and rollers are included. Its exterior looks very different from other freezers in our lineup due to its split contour design and natural silver finish. The top and bottom have separate, reversible swinging doors for convenience. Weekly-used items could be stored in the top half to prevent longer range items stored on the bottom from being exposed to daily blasts of warm air."]},"id":"957851aa-3f9f-4045-a4be-bae3f20409d4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"56d51396-7398-4c2f-9e7f-515d6d6ed389","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool EV209NBTN upright freezer received a low ranking due to its small capacity.
