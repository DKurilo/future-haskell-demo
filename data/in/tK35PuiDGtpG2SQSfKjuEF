You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","The Toro 42-inch TimeCutter SS4216 (74616) is a heavy-duty <a href=\"/best-riding-lawn-mowers\">riding mower</a> designed to complete mowing projects quickly. It&#39;s a strong entry in the field and has several performance-boosting features.","This zero-turn lawn mower has a tight turning radius and maneuvers around any obstacle or landscape feature. Its speed system lets you choose between a high-speed mode and a precise-control mode for versatility on large projects. As with any zero-turn mower, take caution when you maneuver steep hills.","The 42-inch blades cut a wide swath and fit best in sparsely decorated spaces. The riding mower reaches up to 7 mph to finish large jobs quickly, and the high-capacity fuel tank means that you don&#39;t need to stop before your work is done.","This riding mower is easy to maintain. Washout ports make cleaning under the deck an easy task, keeping buildup from affecting your mower&#39;s performance. A super-thick 10-gauge steel deck is durable enough to resist rocks and other hazards, letting you power through difficult terrain.","You can set the blade height from 1.5 to 4.5 inches for precision cuts. An optional foot-assist height-of-cut system lets you adjust the blade height while you are driving the riding mower and avoid sudden objects or uneven features. Additional attachments include a twin bagger for clipping collection and a recycler that mulches the cuttings and puts them back to feed your lawn.","When you need to mow a large area in the hot sun, the optional sunshade keeps you cool. A comfortable seat and soft-grip turning handles allow you to run the riding mower all day with little strain. The dual hydrostatic transmission system operates automatically so that you can focus on steering instead of shifting gears.","For your safety, the nonslip deck supports you when you step onto or off the mower, and the automatic parking brake keeps the mower in place. Toro&#39;s three-year limited warranty protects you against material or workmanship defects, regardless of how many hours you run the mower.","The Toro 42-inch TimeCutter SS4216 riding mower offers solid performance for rural lawns and fields. It&#39;s durable and maneuverable, and it includes control features exclusive to Toro."]},"id":"15db88b7-5901-4f26-a3a6-2c96b30c5dc4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60856","url":"/timecutter-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"danny-chadwick","url":"/author/danny-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Danny Chadwick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"DhF8Hg8QQde8MtLyq8X8JN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-17T22:19:30Z","datePublished":"2014-10-17T22:19:30Z","name":"TimeCutter SS4216","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.
