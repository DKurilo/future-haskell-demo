The 27 available exercises give you an efficient full body workout that targets your chest, shoulders, back, abs and legs.","The Wolverine is a weight stack system with 200 pounds of resistance, and it supports a maximum user weight of 275 pounds. While 300 pounds is average among the machines we reviewed, the <a href=\"/total-gym-fit-review\">Total Gym FIT</a> has a much higher weight limit of 450 pounds. Like nine other home gyms we evaluated, including the FIT, the Wolverine features a pulley and cable system, with no need  to change pulleys to switch between exercises. For additional comfort and convenience, its seats, press bars and handles are adjustable, its pulley and press handles swivel, and its pads are ergonomically designed. Its squat bar has four different height options, along with removable squat pads.","This machine comes with a seated leg press attachment, along with a long lat bar, short straight bar, ab crunch harness and single cable handle. Its weight stack has a keeper for its pin, and it has safety handles and an oversized footplate.","Like the <a href=\"/powertec-workbench-multi-system-review\">Powertec Workbench Multi-System</a> and the <a href=\"/bodycraft-galena-pro-review\">Bodycraft Galena Pro</a>, this multi-user system is big. Its dimensions are 86 x 115 x 82 inches (length, width and height), and it weighs 610 pounds. Once assembled, moving it is nearly impossible. As you determine its placement, be sure to have enough space around the machine for full range of exercise motion.","If you don’t need a multi-user system, the <a href=\"/body-solid-g1s-review\">Body-Solid G1S</a> is our favorite home gym. The G1S is priced almost $700 less than the Wolverine’s MSRP of nearly $1,600 and  comes with extras that the Yukon machine doesn’t have, such as instructional videos, a triceps strap, a water bottle holder and a towel holder. Both machines are upgradeable to include a triceps rope.","Yukon Fitness provides a lifetime warranty on this home gym’s welded structure if the machine hasn’t been used inappropriately. However, if the Wolverine is used commercially, the warranty doesn’t apply. For customer service, you can reach Yukon by phone and email."]},"id":"2f795621-0743-4363-b69e-087fabd87d24","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"91f10cd4-2bdf-4f7b-9814-d40bd5de5ed5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This home gym"]},"id":"0be56749-ddfe-4bc1-a24f-60a578d1dd09","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61255","url":"/yukon-wolverine-multi-station-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-21T21:18:37Z","datePublished":"2014-11-21T21:18:37Z","name":"Yukon Wolverine Multi-Station","synopsis":"The Yukon Wolverine is a sturdy, multisystem home gym that up to four people can use simultaneously.
