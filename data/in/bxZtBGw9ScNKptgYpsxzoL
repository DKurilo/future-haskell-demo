It’s costly, with quotes that are nearly double that of some competitors and it doesn’t have as many options for discounts as other insurers.","To get an idea of what costs you can expect from each insurer, we got quotes for a variety of scenarios. We used third party data and looked at which cars are the most and least expensive to insure. Using that information we checked on the cost for a policy with one car from each list. AAA was by far the most expensive, with premiums costing close to $1,000 more than the lowest cost. Even a policy with the bare minimum coverage allowed by law was significantly more than comparable insurers.","It’s important to understand that a variety of factors contribute to the cost of your insurance policy. Some of these, including type of car, location and driving history, we could use in our quotes. Other factors, like credit score, we couldn’t add to our quotes, so you may get different results. Having just a good credit score can increase your premiums by several hundred dollars.","AAA offers many options for getting discounts on your policy. If you choose to get homeowner’s, renter’s or life insurance through AAA you can get a discount. Most standard insurance discounts are available. If you avoid accidents and if students are on your policy, you can get additional savings. You can also be eligible for a discount if your mileage meets a certain threshold. To get this discount you’ll have to supply a current odometer reading for your vehicle. None of our quotes included these discounts, so you may be able to get substantial savings on your policy.","If you’re in an accident, you can get rental car reimbursement included on your policy. At the most basic level you’ll get reimbursed $30 a day, with a maximum amount of $900. You can adjust these limits for a nominal cost. You can also sign up for accident forgiveness, which prevents your premiums from spiking if you’re involved in an accident."]},"id":"e18f6cda-a398-4482-913d-7e39e0b9c989","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3502","url":"/aaa-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-08-04T15:53:57Z","datePublished":"2009-08-04T15:53:57Z","name":"AAA Auto Insurance","synopsis":"Well regarded for its roadside assistance programs, AAA’s auto insurance is one of the least impressive we saw.","review":{"rating":50,"verdict":"Better known for its roadside assistance, AAA&#8217;s auto insurance is expensive.","pros":["Offers accident forgiveness."],"cons":["Expensive policies."]},"strapline":"Well regarded for its roadside assistance programs, AAA’s auto insurance is one of the least impressive we saw.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","id":"bxZtBGw9ScNKptgYpsxzoL","meta":{"title":"AAA Auto Insurance Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Better known for its roadside assistance, AAA&#8217;s auto insurance is expensive."},"products":[{"slug":"aaa-auto-insurance","url":"/product/aaa-auto-insurance","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:36Z","name":"AAA Auto Insurance","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:36Z","id":"ZYJGZ34zVYMve3YsXQpMZE","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-05T14:09:36Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/kyh6bh63j3PDftypiEfjjD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:36Z","mimeType":"","name":"04f7653e282974fa1d3b20ee5d708ad2.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/04f7653e282974fa1d3b20ee5d708ad2.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:36Z","id":"kyh6bh63j3PDftypiEfjjD","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kyh6bh63j3PDftypiEfjjD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"AAA Auto Insurance Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Better known for its roadside assistance, AAA&#8217;s auto insurance is expensive."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/kyh6bh63j3PDftypiEfjjD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:36Z","mimeType":"","name":"04f7653e282974fa1d3b20ee5d708ad2.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/04f7653e282974fa1d3b20ee5d708ad2.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:36Z","id":"kyh6bh63j3PDftypiEfjjD","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kyh6bh63j3PDftypiEfjjD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"AAA Auto Insurance Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Better known for its roadside assistance, AAA&#8217;s auto insurance is expensive."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/services/insurance/best-auto-insurance/aaa-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"travel-and-auto","url":"/travel-and-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:36Z","name":"Travel & Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:36Z","id":"HmhJjMTFinoVnKmEwqRGEm","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"auto-services","url":"/travel-and-auto/auto-services","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:09:36Z","name":"Auto Services","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:09:36Z","id":"gtW4iQeXfGEkPDzPmkxeaB","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
