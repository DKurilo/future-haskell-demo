Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product. The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse\">Wireless Keyboards</a> here.</em>","The HP Ultra Thin Wireless Keyboard takes practical performance and spices it up with thoughtful design. Although it is not as versatile as some higher-ranked wireless keyboards featured in ourÂ best wireless computer keyboards lineup, HP delivers a compact keyboard with light-touch key action and reliable wireless connectivity. We gave it the number six spot on our lineup after finding it lacking some desirable extras. However, it is worth trying if you&#39;d like a stylish, full-size wireless keyboard that will satisfy your need for basic input with just enough options to keep the learning curve from becoming overwhelming.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>The Ultra Thin is as functional as it is handsome. It meets the competition with a wireless range of 30 feet supported by 2.4 GHz connectivity and instantly syncs to your computer with its own device-networking receiver. The HP Link-5, a tiny dongle that supports up to five compatible devices, requires only one available USB port for plug-and-play operability. Setup is easy and takes only a few seconds.","This keyboard comes with preprogrammed F keys that activate commonly used functions and applications such as your calculator and email provider. It also allows you to program the F keys as you wish, using the included software. The keyboard is powered by three AAA batteries that are estimated to last up to 24 months, and it features an integrated sleep button, which can help you save energy whenever you step away from your desk. The Ultra Thin lacks some enhanced features that our top-ranked products include, such as customizable hotkeys and one-touch media and internet buttons. But the enhanced design features make up for the no-frills features package.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>The Ultra Thin shines in the design category. Its strength lies in its clean lines and practical key arrangement. Set in lustrous black with silver accents, it earns bragging rights for being one of the most compact keyboards in our lineup, measuring at just over 16 inches long and 7 inches wide. It has a relatively slim profile with the added benefit of a cushioned palm rest for wrist support. It also is adjustable, allowing for typing in two different positions. And, you can eat, drink and be merry while you&#39;re working because this keyboard is spill resistant as well.","This keyboard has a standard layout for the most part, although HP shifted the arrow keys to the left and relocated the delete/home/page keys and print screen, insert, scroll lock and pause/break keys to reside along the top edge of the keyboard to the right of the F keys. The keys are very much like those you would find on a laptop. They produce a quiet, light-touch typing experience made possible by flat, chiclet-style keys that operate using a scissor-switch mechanism. Since the keys themselves are low profile and not concave-shaped like those on a standard mechanical keyboard, you may need some time for your fingers to adjust to the feel of them.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>HP has substantial online support for its various products and services. The product page for the Ultra Thin contains a link to HP&#39;s customer service as well as a tab that shows you support options, which includes a troubleshooting link, a user manual download link and a support information link that takes you to the HP Customer Care page. If you need to speak to a customer service representative or technician, there also is a toll-free telephone number listed on the product page. Although HP&#39;s support services are readily available online, we found the process of navigating through so much general information a frustrating endeavor. This keyboard comes with a 21-day return policy and a short one-year warranty."]},"id":"17a720cb-32b5-4c15-b9df-faf9106fbdd4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4e8cc983-1b9c-45f6-86b8-b97a66d381a2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Ultra Thin Wireless Keyboard presents itself as a keyboard that combines style and high-tech key action to deliver an ultra-thin design and silent operation.
