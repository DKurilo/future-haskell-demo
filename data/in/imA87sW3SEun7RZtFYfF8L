You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Husqvarna Automower 220AC <a href=\"/best-robot-lawn-mowers\">robotic lawn mower</a> is an uncomplicated model that is suitable for mowing lawns of up to 0.35 acres. If the lawn is too large for it to cut in one charge, the lawn mower will return to its charging base, recharge and return to finish the job. In rain or high humidity conditions, the mower will continue to operate, as it does not come with a rain sensor that would tell it to return to its base until humidity levels dropped.","Running on battery power, it produces no emissions and is eco-friendly. The included NiMH battery takes 45 minutes to fully charge and will then run for an equal 45 minutes before needing to return to its base. Compared to lithium batteries, the Ni-MH holds a shorter charge, causing it to have to recharge more frequently. Also, replacement is needed every two to three seasons, whereas lithium batteries last for three to five years.","The Husqvarna Automower 220AC automatic lawn mower cuts grass via a preset schedule or through direct command. Scheduling and lawn mowing preferences are set through the 19-button touchpad and LCD display screen. All scheduling and settings must be completed through the base itself as there are no remote options, nor is there an app or wireless connection available.","Cutting height is set manually to cut grass between 0.8 and 2.4 inches, and cutting width is a narrow 8.7 inches. An unconventional blade system, comprised of three carbon steel razor blades encased in a cutting disc, makes a finer cut than a conventional blade would, leaving the lawn healthier. The blade system needs replacing every two to three months instead of yearly, raising maintenance costs significantly.","Safety features for the Husqvarna Automower 220AC include lift, tilt and obstacle sensors, which will shut it down completely or redirect it, as well as a PIN code lock to keep children from activating it. In addition to a built-in anti-theft alarm, the PIN code also provides an extra layer of security, keeping unauthorized users of any age from turning it on.","With a maximum slope or incline of 20 degrees, the Husqvarna Automower 220AC robot lawn mower is suitable for yards that are mostly level or that have only slight terrain differences. For yards or gardens with multiple areas to mow that are separated by pavement or other dividers, this model may not be a good fit as there is no multizone capability available.","The Husqvarna Automower AC220 is a proper fit for someone that needs an easy-to-operate automatic lawn mower that can handle a singular, small and relatively level lawn area. The inconvenience of not being able to control or access it through a remote, app or Bluetooth connection should be considered, but it covers the basics well."]},"id":"52827f59-7a1a-41fb-ac70-88629e7d58d9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63703","url":"/husqvarna-automower-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"danny-chadwick","url":"/author/danny-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Danny Chadwick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"DhF8Hg8QQde8MtLyq8X8JN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-25T21:08:33Z","datePublished":"2015-03-25T21:08:33Z","name":"Husqvarna Automower 220AC","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-25T21:08:33Z","id":"imA87sW3SEun7RZtFYfF8L","meta":{"title":"Husqvarna Automower 220AC Review","description":"The Husqvarna Automower 220AC robotic lawn mower is an uncomplicated model that is suitable for mowing lawns of up to 0.35 acres."},"products":[{"slug":"husqvarna-automower-220ac","url":"/product/husqvarna-automower-220ac","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:11Z","name":"Husqvarna Automower 220AC","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:11Z","id":"BLWByoPc45DJm4wvQAPTqV","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:16:12Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/WJZum8nHBxwveeNUCD7GBU.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:11Z","mimeType":"","name":"63675-husqvarna-automower-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63675-husqvarna-automower-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:11Z","id":"WJZum8nHBxwveeNUCD7GBU","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WJZum8nHBxwveeNUCD7GBU.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Husqvarna Automower 220AC Review","description":"The Husqvarna Automower 220AC robotic lawn mower is an uncomplicated model that is suitable for mowing lawns of up to 0.35 acres."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/WJZum8nHBxwveeNUCD7GBU.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:11Z","mimeType":"","name":"63675-husqvarna-automower-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63675-husqvarna-automower-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:11Z","id":"WJZum8nHBxwveeNUCD7GBU","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WJZum8nHBxwveeNUCD7GBU.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Husqvarna Automower 220AC Review","description":"The Husqvarna Automower 220AC robotic lawn mower is an uncomplicated model that is suitable for mowing lawns of up to 0.35 acres."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/outdoor/best-robot-lawn-mowers/husqvarna-automower-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:11Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:11Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"lawn-mowers","url":"/home-and-garden/lawn-mowers","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:11Z","name":"Lawn Mowers","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:11Z","id":"smr57URmWPEAAvpHn7aR9h","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
