Like the rest of the suite&#39;s productivity applications, it has a focus on easy collaboration and a simple, user-friendly interface. While it’s not available as a stand-alone application, you’ll likely find yourself using at least some of the other apps on a regular basis.","This <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-microsoft-office-alternatives\">spreadsheet software</a> works in conjunction with Google Drive, which is essentially cloud storage, so your files are accessible from any device with internet access. You can install Google Apps on your mobile devices to increase the software&#39;s accessibility. The software is free for personal use. For businesses, there is a small cost per user.","While Google Sheets lacks in some areas, it excels in collaboration. Multiple users can access and edit the same document in real time, so you can see the changes your colleagues are making as they make them. You can even start an IM conversation within the spreadsheet, letting you throw around ideas, explain your thought processes, ask for assistance or assign tasks without leaving the sheet. Provided you and the other users all have the appropriate permissions, you can each comment or leave notes on cells. To review who made which changes, you can simply look in the revision history. There’s no need to save your spreadsheet, as Google Sheets, like the rest of the Google Apps suite, saves and backs up to Google Drive automatically every few seconds, so you won’t lose changes if you forget to save or your system crashes.","Google Sheets supports common file formats like XLS and XLSX, but it doesn’t always open or import large or particularly complex files well. This application also lets you create charts, but there are no 3D or ultra-modern options. Instead, you’re limited to a handful of traditional chart types, although this is adequate for most users and more than you get with some other programs. The formula repository is not as extensive as some of its competitors&#39; libraries, but still enough to complete all but the most complex of tasks.","You can get support for Google Sheets via the help forum or the Google Docs help center in the form of FAQs and a variety of troubleshooting and usage tutorials. You won’t find any live chat, email or telephone support available, however."]},"id":"264b7fd9-1998-4edd-9321-cc42dcef1837","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68697","url":"/google-sheets-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-03T16:03:30Z","datePublished":"2016-11-03T16:03:30Z","name":"Google Sheets","synopsis":"Google Sheets is part of the Google Apps suite.
