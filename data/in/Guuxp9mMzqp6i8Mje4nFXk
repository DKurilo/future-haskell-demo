You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The WORX WG772 Cordless Lawn Mower is an <a href=\"/best-electric-lawn-mowers\">electric lawn mower</a> that features a wide 19-inch cutting path. The WG772 comes with two li-ion batteries that are used at the same time. In our tests, the two 56-volt batteries lasted up to 40 minutes on a full charge, which should be plenty of power for a yard up to 1/3 acre in size. The batteries weigh about 2 pounds each, which is typical for li-ions. They are removable and fully recharge in two hours using the included charger. This machine comes with a convenient battery power indicator, which shows you how much power remains while you mow.","The best electric lawn mowers strike a balance between weight and performance. The WORX WG772 weighs just under 53 pounds, so it’s one of the heavier li-ion battery-powered models we reviewed. A full bag of clippings will further weigh it down, especially since this particular model has a bag that is larger than most. This WORX mower isn’t self-propelled, which can also make it difficult to push. However, it has a mulching feature and a side discharge point, both of which make it lighter and easier to handle. All of the features and benefits this model lacks can be found in our top pick: <a href=\"/ego-lm2101-review\">EGO LM2102SP</a>.","WORX includes a three-year warranty to protect against any defects. In the event you have any questions or run in to problems, you can reach out to customer service through live chat on the company&#39;s website. If you prefer to speak to a representative by phone, a hotline is also available. There are no service centers for this lawn mower, so all claims and repairs must be handled through the company directly."]},"id":"83e9250b-27e9-4683-8d1b-49f1c310a2cb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"31483ecc-7c2e-4b6c-88dc-52bfa9c3d1bb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The WORX WG772 Cordless Lawn Mower sports many of the features advanced electric lawn mowers have, including a long battery life and large bag size.The WG772 is lighter than a gas-powered mower but heavier than most electric ones, so it may be too difficult for some users to push as the bag fills with clippings.
