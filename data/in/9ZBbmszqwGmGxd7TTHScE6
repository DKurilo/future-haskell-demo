developed Glary Utilities Pro as an all-in-one <a href=\"/best-pc-system-utilities-software\">PC system utility software</a> suite for freeing up disk space, cleaning the registry, managing the drivers, tightening up privacy and maintaining security protocols. The suite provides more than 20 tools to improve and optimize your computer. In our tests, it produced the best results and earned a high diagnostic consistency score.","We tested each PC optimization product on a frustratingly slow computer running Windows 7. We used PCMark 10, a third-party program, to benchmark the PC’s performance both before and after running the optimization tools. The benchmarking tested word and data processing, graphics processing, web browsing and video chat. We tested whether the tools achieved any improvement in the boot speed and evaluated the diagnostic consistency of the software. A good PC cleaner should diagnose issues consistently.","After multiple rounds of testing Glary’s optimization tools, the average improvement to our test PC was 12.62 percent. While that was the best result achieved in our tests, it still wasn’t enough to make a noticeable difference. In fact, the computer’s performance on the PCMark test ranked it in the bottom 12 percent of computers both before and after running the optimization tools. In other words, even though Glary Utilities Pro produced the biggest performance improvement, it wasn’t enough to turn a slow computer into a fast one.","On average, the Glary utilities improved the word- and data-processing performance by 6.1 percent and the graphics-processing performance by 6.35 percent. The software failed to improve web-browsing speed, however, and it improved the video chat quality by only 0.18 percent.","Using the Glary boot optimization tool, we improved the startup speed by an average of 34.52 percent. That increase was the most noticeable improvement the software made. Nonetheless, we achieved a better result – a 42 percent improvement in boot speed – using the startup manager tool that’s built in to Windows.","The Glary software only recovered an average of 800 MB of storage. That isn’t a lot, but it’s more than most of the others achieved in our comparison.","Glary Utilities Pro received an A for diagnostic consistency. We tested this metric by scanning for errors, fixing them and then immediately scanning for errors again. Theoretically, a tool shouldn’t find errors on the second scan. Glary found only a few additional errors. We ran almost 30 of these tests, so an A grade for diagnostic consistency is excellent. Only <a href=\"/system-cleaner-review\">System Cleaner</a> and <a href=\"/fix-it-utilities-pro-review\">Fix-It Utilities Pro</a> earned perfect diagnostic consistency scores.","We gave the software’s ease of use a C grade, meaning the average novice may find it more difficult to use than most of the other software in our review. The suite contains many tools, but most of them don’t offer much help and only clutter the interface.","The most convenient aspect of the interface is its one-click maintenance tab, which lets you run all of the optimization tools at once. But in general, the interface is complicated and requires some experience to navigate effectively.","The Glary software also earned a C– for ease of installation because it tries to get you to install additional software, Malware Hunter. Typically, when software tries to get you to install other software, you should decline, as the additional programs are often bloatware and can sometimes be malicious. In this case, the additional software installation seemed to hide in a box, appearing only to ask you to agree to terms and conditions. You have to pay close attention, or you may end up installing software you don’t want.","Glary Utilities Pro has more than 20 optimization tools. You can back up and restore your entire system, recover accidentally deleted files, repair shortcuts and registries, optimize security and privacy, and shred and encrypt files.","The only advanced tool that’s missing is a solid-state drive optimizer, but only a few PC utility products have this tool. Optimizing an SSD can be tricky because you can actually shorten the drive’s life span. If you do want an SSD optimizing option, consider <a href=\"/system-mechanic-review\">System Mechanic</a>.","You get three computer licenses with Glary Utilities Pro, letting you install the software on three computers. The help and support options are disappointing, however. You can only contact customer support via email; there’s no phone support or live chat. The service does host a FAQs section on its website, but the content is scant."]},"id":"f030fb5c-630c-42bc-ad66-f9977c6c3875","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"8d902994-8867-4ce3-85b5-bb72cd4b55db","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["]"]},"id":"44e9e9a2-cfb1-4669-9221-535213878feb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68073","url":"/glary-utilities-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-30T15:57:53Z","datePublished":"2016-06-30T15:57:53Z","name":"Glary Utilities Pro 5","synopsis":"Glarysoft Ltd. developed Glary Utilities Pro as an all-in-one PC system utility software suite for freeing up disk space, cleaning the registry, managing the drivers, tightening up privacy and maintaining security protocols.","review":{"rating":89,"verdict":"Glary Utilities Pro produced the best overall improvement, but even a 12.62 percent performance boost isn&#8217;t enough to be noticeable.","pros":["It improved computer performance by 12.62 percent."],"cons":["It didn&#8217;t improve web browsing speed."]},"strapline":"Glarysoft Ltd. developed Glary Utilities Pro as an all-in-one PC system utility software suite for freeing up disk space, cleaning the registry, managing the drivers, tightening up privacy and maintaining security protocols.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-29T00:00:00Z","id":"9ZBbmszqwGmGxd7TTHScE6","meta":{"title":"Glary Utilities Pro 5 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Glary Utilities Pro produced the best overall improvement, but even a 12.62 percent performance boost isn&#8217;t enough to be noticeable."},"products":[{"slug":"glary-utilities-pro-5","url":"/product/glary-utilities-pro-5","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:41:41Z","name":"Glary Utilities Pro 5","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:41:41Z","id":"LgNH6MWvUtY4bKqHoxwKtK","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:41:41Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ppXJLFM6pMFXigtatXuFWo.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:41:41Z","mimeType":"","name":"55896b971a592cb9881dd4b1b61c7c7a.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/55896b971a592cb9881dd4b1b61c7c7a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:41:41Z","id":"ppXJLFM6pMFXigtatXuFWo","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ppXJLFM6pMFXigtatXuFWo.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Glary Utilities Pro 5 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Glary Utilities Pro produced the best overall improvement, but even a 12.62 percent performance boost isn&#8217;t enough to be noticeable."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ppXJLFM6pMFXigtatXuFWo.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:41:41Z","mimeType":"","name":"55896b971a592cb9881dd4b1b61c7c7a.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/55896b971a592cb9881dd4b1b61c7c7a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:41:41Z","id":"ppXJLFM6pMFXigtatXuFWo","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ppXJLFM6pMFXigtatXuFWo.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Glary Utilities Pro 5 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Glary Utilities Pro produced the best overall improvement, but even a 12.62 percent performance boost isn&#8217;t enough to be noticeable."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/software/utilities/best-pc-system-utilities-software/glary-utilities-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:41:41Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:41:41Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"computers","url":"/electronics/computers","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:41:41Z","name":"Computers","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:41:41Z","id":"o7A3TAPY7RTrVES9Lb9iRS","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
