It had some of the best prices we saw, though there aren’t as many opportunities to earn discounts as with other insurers.","Auto insurance pricing takes many factors into account. Obviously the type of car you drive is a big one, and some cars are more expensive to insure than others. To get an idea of what you can expect to pay for a GEICO policy we got quotes for a car typically regarded as being more expensive to insure and for a car that’s less expensive. For both types of cars, GEICO quotes us rates that were among the lowest we saw, a few hundred dollars less than the average quote for insurers we reviewed.","We also got a quote for a policy with two cars. GEICO had one of the lowest costing policies for multiple cars, so it may be a good option if you use more than one vehicle. Adding a teenage driver to your policy did have a dramatic effect, increasing the cost nearly five-fold in some cases.","Most of our quotes are for the industry recommended coverage limits of 100/300/100, but you can opt to get a policy that just meets your state’s minimum limit. When we got a quote for a minimum policy, we found that it wasn’t especially cheaper than the higher coverage levels, only about a $20 difference.","It’s important to know that you’ll likely get a different amount quoted to you. Insurance companies use information about where you live, your driving record and even your credit history to determine how much a policy will cost. Having just a good credit score, in the 650 to 700 range, can add hundreds of dollars to your premium.","Like most insurers, you can get a variety of discounts through GEICO. If you or a student on your policy maintains a B average you can get a reduction on your premium. Discounts are also available for signing up for auto pay and maintaining a safe driving record. There’s no discount available for driving a hybrid or electric car though."]},"id":"8c53a584-4897-4152-be18-fd8a6486abfa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3493","url":"/geico-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-08-04T15:51:44Z","datePublished":"2009-08-04T15:51:44Z","name":"GEICO Auto Insurance","synopsis":"GEICO is one of the most well-known and popular auto-insurance companies.","review":{"rating":77,"verdict":"You can find a low rate through GEICO, but it&#8217;s got fewer discount options.","pros":["Has some of the lowest rates in our lineup."],"cons":["Can&#8217;t use the app to file or store claims information."]},"strapline":"GEICO is one of the most well-known and popular auto-insurance companies.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-10T00:00:00Z","id":"z2m4S8WFCGWZe6QPUwmzzW","meta":{"title":"GEICO Auto Insurance Review - Pros and Cons","description":"You can find a low rate through Geico, but it&#8217;s got fewer discount options."},"products":[{"slug":"geico-auto-insurance","url":"/product/geico-auto-insurance","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:09:39Z","name":"GEICO Auto Insurance","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:09:39Z","id":"YtbCz9gZerbwo9zg3Nv2XU","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:09:39Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/fh92smpbAkcFciamWEsXF9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:09:39Z","mimeType":"","name":"f3e1e8e280653c72af76ab3494b4c03a.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/f3e1e8e280653c72af76ab3494b4c03a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:09:39Z","id":"fh92smpbAkcFciamWEsXF9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fh92smpbAkcFciamWEsXF9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"GEICO Auto Insurance Review - Pros and Cons","description":"You can find a low rate through Geico, but it&#8217;s got fewer discount options."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/fh92smpbAkcFciamWEsXF9.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:09:39Z","mimeType":"","name":"f3e1e8e280653c72af76ab3494b4c03a.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/f3e1e8e280653c72af76ab3494b4c03a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:09:39Z","id":"fh92smpbAkcFciamWEsXF9","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fh92smpbAkcFciamWEsXF9.jpg","alt":""},"title":"GEICO Auto Insurance Review - Pros and Cons","description":"You can find a low rate through Geico, but it&#8217;s got fewer discount options."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/services/insurance/best-auto-insurance/geico-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"travel-and-auto","url":"/travel-and-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:09:39Z","name":"Travel & Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:09:39Z","id":"HmhJjMTFinoVnKmEwqRGEm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"auto-services","url":"/travel-and-auto/auto-services","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:09:39Z","name":"Auto Services","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:09:39Z","id":"gtW4iQeXfGEkPDzPmkxeaB","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
