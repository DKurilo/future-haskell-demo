When it&#39;s hot outside, this can be difficult to do, especially when you can&#39;t use an air conditioner unit to cool the area down. Misting systems provide an efficient solution by using the evaporation cooling process. The unit is connected to a water source and then releases water droplets into the hot air. Those droplets absorb the air&#39;s heat and change into a vapor. This change results in a cooling effect. Popular misting systems include the <a href=\"/home/outdoor/best-misting-systems/mistec-review/\">MISTEC Eurojet</a>, the <a href=\"/home/outdoor/best-misting-systems/mistymate-review/\">MistyMate Misting Fan Ring</a> and the <a href=\"/home/outdoor/best-misting-systems/lava-heat-italia-review/\">Lava Heat ItaliaÂ Aviator X2 Misting Fan</a>.","<strong>Misting Systems: What to Look For</strong>","When you&#39;re looking for a mister for your business, there are several factors to think about prior to actually making a purchase. The operating pressure, flow rate and even the water droplet size can affect how much maintenance your mister will require, how large an area it can cool and the cost of operating the system.","<strong>Operating Pressure Range</strong><br/>Patio misters for commercial use are available in three different pressure ranges: low, middle and high. These systems can range from 40 psi (pounds per square inch) to 1,500 psi, and each one has its own benefits and drawbacks. Low-pressure systems, for instance, can be connected to a normal water supply, like a garden hose, and can produce a cooling effect for smaller areas. However, these misters are more likely to require a lot of maintenance, because they don&#39;t use enough pressure to prevent clogs. High-pressure systems can cool large locations effectively, but replacing their components is often expensive. The amount of pressure these misters produce requires sturdy, high-quality parts.","<strong>Flow Rate</strong><br/>The flow rate of a water mister describes the amount of water it will use over a certain period of time. Not every mister you can purchase indicates a flow rate, and others, like those equipped with water tanks, simply provide you with a length of time you can use the system. When flow rate is included, you can use it as an informative detail to help you make a purchasing decision. The gallons of water the system uses over an hour or a period of hours costs you money. By evaluating the flow rate first in gallons per minute (gpm), you can estimate how much the system and its water usage will cost before you make a commitment. This can help you find an option that will work within your budget.","<strong>Water Droplet Size</strong><br/>Water droplet size is an important decision-making part of buying an outdoor mister. The size of these water droplets is determined by the pressure of the system. The higher the pressure, the quicker the water comes through the nozzle on the mister. High-pressure systems produce finer water droplets. The small size of the droplets means they can evaporate more quickly and cool your customers faster.","The right misting equipment can help you keep your customers cool. Before you do, though, make sure you take the time to look at the system thoroughly and understand how it will work for you."]},"id":"00704f4a-62b9-4a85-9d80-c784f373aaa3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"56de6876-6bf6-47df-8dfe-e55259d83b84","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.aeromist.com/100-ft-1000-psi-nylon-misting-system-w-enclosed-pump.html\">Aeromist</a>","<a href=\"http://www.advancedmistingsystems.com/xcart/product.php?productid=584\">Air Chiller</a>","<a href=\"http://www.cloudburst.com/mist-store/portable-fans-w-tank/2-24-osc-fans-with-tank\">Cloudburst</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NHZZDMK/?&tag=ttr_misting-systems-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1800[art|NA[pid|66958[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Lava Heat Italia</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IXIITDQ/?&tag=ttr_misting-systems-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1800[art|NA[pid|66953[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Mist Cooling</a>","<a href=\"http://mistamerica.com/products/ma-mist/\">MistAmerica</a>","<a href=\"http://www.mistec-inc.com/special-mist-systems.html\">MISTEC</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D387KV8/?&tag=ttr_misting-systems-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1800[art|NA[pid|66951[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">MistyMate</a>","<a href=\"http://linksynergy.walmart.com/fs-bin/click?id=Cty0dj6o3sg&subid=&offerid=223073.1&type=10&tmpid=1082&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FOrbit-0.38-Professional-Outdoor-Cooling-Misting-System%252F19241423\">Orbit</a>","<a href=\"http://www.piianmistsystems.com/economy-mist-system-flexible.html\">Piian Systems</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3febe2c1-b3b9-48dc-ab87-b5bceb276889","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1800","url":"/best-misting-systems","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-06T18:21:29Z","datePublished":"2015-10-16T22:54:48Z","name":"Misting Systems Review","synopsis":"Misting systems reduce the temperature of indoor and outdoor spaces where using an air conditioning system isn't possible or wouldn't be productive.
