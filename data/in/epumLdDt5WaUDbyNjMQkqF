It has all the standard features we ranked products by in this category. Present and accounted for are its 1080p resolution, 3D playback and connectivity array. This unit even comes equipped with apps that allow you to stream video and music directly from the internet.","This 3D Blu-ray player comes ready to use out of the box. There is no special software or hardware you need to install. All you have to do is plug it into the wall and then into your 3D television, and you&#39;re ready to watch 3D movies in fewer than 10 minutes. The simplicity of this unit is the most compelling factor that secured it a place on our top 10 list of the best 3D Blu-ray players.","Like all the products in this category, the Pioneer BDP-140 has the ability to display HD movies in 1080p resolution. This may be the industry standard, but there is nothing ordinary about the deep, rich picture it produces. Additionally, when you&#39;re watching Hollywood films, 3D or not, this unit displays them at 24 frames per second. This is the frame rate that movie theaters use when projecting films on the big screen. This gives you a more cinematic feel to movies viewed on your home theater system.","This player has all the most modern connection options, including HDMI and USB, and it is Wi-Fi ready. Additionally, the Pioneer BDP-140 has several internet apps such as Netflix, Pandora, YouTube and more that allow you to stream movies, TV shows and more right onto your TV or monitor without the need for physical discs.","The 3D capabilities of this unit are serviceable; you will, of course, need a TV that has 3D functionality and a set of glasses for all viewers in the room. That&#39;s a side issue, though, because no 3D Blu-ray player on our lineup comes with 3D glasses. That&#39;s an issue for the 3D TV manufacturers to deal with."]},"id":"2a2e50cc-8f61-4a80-8774-a5923cc7e855","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"45ac3b64-4200-4912-afcd-e50e3f6e1477","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At the end of the day, the Pioneer BDP-140 is one of the best 3D Blu-ray players on the market.
