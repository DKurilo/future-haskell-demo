This brightly illuminated ant habitat is filled with a blue gel that serves as a living environment as well as a source of nourishment and fluids for the ants. This modernistic and visually appealing ant farm gel colony will be a true conversation piece in any home, classroom or even at your office.","This employs a LED illuminator that sends four rays of light through the clear, brilliant blue gel, which provides a stunning visual effect by itself. Add some black ants scurrying around doing all the important tasks for their survival, both as individuals and for the colony, and you have quite an exciting display.","This gel ant farm comes with instructions and an ant tunnel tool, which you will need once your ants arrive. After sending for the live ants, you use the tool to poke beginning tunnels into the gel to help the ants get started with their own tunneling work and acclimate them to their new environment. You also get a written manual filled with facts about ants.","However, there are virtually no other learning tools in this kit, which reduces its educational value. If it included something as simple as a plastic magnifying glass, which would be beneficial and would help children see the ants up close. This has potent visual effects and can and can even serve as a nightlight as well as an attraction. Nonetheless, the Fascinations AntWorks Illuminated Blue does not put kids to work feeding or watering ants, which gives them less involvement in the ant environment. That translates into substantially less play value and educational value than the old-fashioned sand-filled ant farms.","Ants do not come with the price of the kit and are not sold by Fascinations. Instead, its website provides links to three online ant stores from which you can choose ants, pay for them and get them sent to you by mail. There also is a mail-in order form to purchase ants. In addition, you can buy ants from other online stores or simply go outdoors and gather your own ants. A note of caution here: be sure to not get ants from different species or colonies because they do not get along.","The guarantees vary from one firm to the next regarding any free replacement ants in case all your ants arrive in the mail with virtually every one of them dead. You will need to read the websites of online ant stores to see if you can get an extra shipment of free ants if that unfortunate event occurs.","The blue gel was developed as part of a joint experiment with high school students and individuals at Syracuse University, and it was used as a medium for ants that zipped off in 2003 into space aboard NASAâ€™s space shuttle Columbia. The gel is created from seaweed and contains water, sugars and amino acids, with an added fungicide to keep it from decomposing in the highly moist environment inside the kit. For the ants, this gel serves as both a source of food and water as well as a place to live. The blue gel is not toxic for humans, but you should never eat it or allow a child to do so. Although Fascinations does not sell refill gel, there are online stores that do. There are no guarantees that any new ants you get will like it, however, so you will have to take your chances if you attempt to reuse this ant habitat.","This ant farm is 6.5 inches high, 6 inches wide and 1.25 inches deep. It weighs 2.3 pounds.","Fascinations offers email and phone support. However, you do not get a frequently asked questions section on its website.","This is a beautiful piece of desk art that would no doubt brighten the work cubicle of any office worker or look great on a shelf at home. However, while it provides great and very clear opportunities to view ants, it offers only limited educational information for children to learn about ants."]},"id":"bbc06a14-0fc2-4a34-aa11-6c7380cc004c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55334","url":"/antworks-illuminated-blue-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-07T15:23:33Z","datePublished":"2012-11-07T15:23:33Z","name":"Fascinations AntWorks Illuminated Blue","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
