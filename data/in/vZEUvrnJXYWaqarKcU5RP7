The European design of this device means temperature readings are only in Celsius; this thermometer does not offer a Fahrenheit scale. If you need Fahrenheit readings, consider <a href=\"/best-candy-thermometers\">CDN IRXL400 ProAccurate</a>.","This candy thermometer is 11.4 inches long and weighs only 4.8 ounces. It features easy-to-read numbers that begin at 80 degrees Celsius and go up to 200 degrees Celsius. However, the thermometer’s cage may obscure the numbers at times, making it tricky to read the temperature without having to move the cage. The Matfer Candy Thermometer is mercury free; red alcohol shows the temperature display and helps you to get the most accurate reading possible.","In addition to protecting the thermometer from scratches and breakage, the protector also features a handle that can guard against burning your fingers when you want to take a closer look at the temperature gauge. When you are ready to store the Matfer, the protector will keep it safe in a drawer or your pocket.","Matfer thermometers are known for their accuracy, and professional cooks rely on these candy thermometers for their durability and long-term use in their kitchens. Its lightweight design and thin frame make it an easy go-to candy, jam, chocolate and deep-fry thermometer.","It is important to note that the Matfer Candy Thermometer’s manufacturer is French, so the product manual that comes with it is also printed in French. This model is on the pricey end of the range for analog thermometers. The thermometer also lacks a clip or bracket to hook it onto a pot’s rim and hold it steady, which can be an annoyance and a safety issue. You can buy a clip made for this model separately, but it will add to the cost of this already high-priced device.","If you want a stylish, accurate, and easy-to-use thermometer that boasts a good reputation with kitchen professionals, and you don’t mind Celsius-only readings, the Matfer is worth serious consideration."]},"id":"f4833841-790d-48db-936b-a1b38dc045f9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63285","url":"/matfer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-06T23:08:31Z","datePublished":"2015-03-06T23:08:31Z","name":"Matfer Bourgeat 250331","synopsis":"The Matfer Candy Thermometer features a European design and temperature readings, and a polyamide cage that protects the thermometer’s tip, so that you can get the most accurate reading for your","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Matfer Candy Thermometer features a European design and temperature readings, and a polyamide cage that protects the thermometer’s tip, so that you can get the most accurate reading for your","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-06T23:08:31Z","id":"vZEUvrnJXYWaqarKcU5RP7","meta":{"title":"Matfer Bourgeat 250331 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Matfer Bourgeat.
