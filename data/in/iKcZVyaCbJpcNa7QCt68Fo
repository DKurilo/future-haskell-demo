In addition, you can use the handheld unit to remotely point the camera at different parts of the room. Although you can't record video or take pictures with the DXR-8, these aren’t important features for a baby monitor. <br />\n <br />\nSetup is incredibly easy. After charging the handheld unit overnight, we plugged in the camera and it instantly connected. There was a slight lag in the video when the camera and handheld unit were 50 feet apart, which is why it only scored 90 percent in our connection test, but that’s still better than other baby monitors we reviewed. In our battery life test, the monitor lasted 10 hours – only one other model has a battery that lasts this long. <br />\n <br />\nThis video baby monitor doesn't have Wi-Fi, but that's not a problem. Our top Wi-Fi monitor, the Philips Avent, is more expensive and didn't perform as well as the DXR-8 in our tests. <br />\n <br />\nThis baby camera has swappable lenses for telephoto and wide-angle views. It also has invisible infrared LEDs that let you see your baby in complete darkness without waking them. The DXR-8 doesn't have a nightlight or lullabies to comfort your baby, but those exclusions don't make this baby monitor any less impressive.

Also, you can't move the camera remotely, a feature you may not use if you only watch your baby as they sleep.   <br />\n   <br />\nThe Wide View 2.0 makes up for its video quality with a user-friendly design. It only takes a few minutes to set up and a couple hours to charge the handheld unit. The handheld unit lets you adjust the volume and has an uncomplicated menu. This simplicity comes at the cost of common features – the Wide View 2.0 doesn't track room temperature, and it can't play lullabies through the camera unit.   <br />\n   <br />\nBecause this is a simple video monitor, the battery lasted nine hours before it needed to recharge during our tests. The overall best baby monitor, the Infant Optics DXR-8, went 10 hours before shutting off, so this is a very good result.   <br />\n   <br />\nThe Summer Infant Wide View 2.0's handheld unit has a limited indoor range compared to most other baby cameras – it’s good enough for most homes but insufficient in particularly large ones.

While some baby monitors have excellent video, even those with lower quality video are suitable for watching your infant. Screen resolution does not necessarily mean good image quality, so we didn&#39;t use it as a point of comparison, relying only on video performance as observed in our tests.","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","The speakers and microphones on baby monitors are unremarkable since they&#39;re not used for complex audio like music. Most of the monitors we tested had slight lag and sounded like a phone call, though some had more lag as well as distortions such as static, crackles and pops.","To test connectivity, we put the handheld unit and the camera in neighboring rooms with 30 feet between them. We looked for lag, choppiness, and changes in the video or sound quality. While we rated it separately, we also did tests to estimate each baby cam’s maximum indoor range. Each camera we tested has a range of 100 feet or more, which is enough for an average-size home.","While not as objective as our other testing categories, we examined each model’s setup process and whether it was easy to navigate the menu, change settings and use the smartphone app, if applicable. Most baby monitors were easy enough to use, but we had some trouble during setup on a few models, especially the Wi-Fi ones.","In our battery tests, we put each baby camera in sleep mode with video off and the audio on. We set off the unit every two hours to represent a baby waking up during the night. The average battery life was eight hours.","<strong>How Much do Video Baby Monitors Cost?</strong>","You can expect to pay between $30 and $200 for a dedicated video baby monitor, with most branded units costing around $100 on average. Units that allow you to remotely reposition the camera with pan-tilt-zoom functionality are more expensive than those with a fixed view. Wi-Fi video baby monitors don&#39;t generally cost extra, because the lack of a specific parent unit balances out the costs of adding Wi-Fi functionality.","<strong>Video Baby Monitor Basics</strong>","Beyond the specific features we tested, here are a few other things to consider:","Viewing Your Baby<br/>Every camera we tested has night vision, which lets you observe your baby in a dark nursery without disturbing them. This is because night vision uses infrared light, which is invisible to human eyes. Most baby cameras can attach to the wall to keep them away from curious fingers and for an improved view of the crib or play area. Also, most monitors we tested let you remotely move the camera&#39;s lens to get a better view.","Helpful Notifications<br/>Video baby monitors have a sleep mode that turns off the screen when there&#39;s no activity in your baby&#39;s room. If your baby makes a loud sound, the screen turns on or you get a notification on your phone. Some monitors also use vibration or flashing lights as notifications so you can turn the audio off for quiet time. You can press a button on the parent unit or mobile app to talk to your baby and sooth them back to sleep.","Warranty<br/>The industry average warranty is one year, though the Philips Avent comes with two years of coverage. ","<strong>Extra Features You Might Want to Consider</strong>","Some extra features aren&#39;t very important, but they can make your life easier.","Soothing Your Baby<br/>More than half of the units we tested have a thermometer that lets you check the temperature in your baby&#39;s room at a glance. Some monitors include nightlights to help comfort your baby. You can also play a handful of recorded lullabies on many of the monitors we tested.","Getting Extra Cameras<br/>With some monitors, you can add more cameras and view them using the handheld screen or mobile app. The number of cameras you need depends on why you want them, since one camera, when placed correctly, is sufficient for watching your baby as they sleep.","Recording Videos &amp; Images<br/>Many video baby monitors let you take pictures or record videos of your baby and save them to a storage device. However, security cameras, which have HD video quality and recording options, are a better for saving these precious moments.","<strong>More Guides for Parents: </strong>"]},"id":"a9e6750d-aeaa-450f-ac23-7c524a229b54","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-baby-sound-machines\">The Best Baby Sound Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-humidifiers\">The Best Humidifiers</a>","<a href=\"/best-baby-wraps\">The Best Baby Wraps</a>","<a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">The Best Car Seats</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"72aa7b58-20f6-431e-b932-558759ba9490","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_21","url":"/best-baby-video-monitors","authors":[{"email":"jcarlsen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-10T17:59:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-10T17:59:00Z","name":"Best Video Baby Monitors of 2019","synopsis":"We tested each baby monitor’s video quality, audio quality, connection quality, ease of use and battery life.
