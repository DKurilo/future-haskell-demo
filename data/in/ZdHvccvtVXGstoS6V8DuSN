It has the usual suite of playback features, including deep color and 24p playback for visual fidelity. As with most series in its price range, the Sony doesn&#39;t include 4K conversion support, but this is a feature that only matters for TVs with 4K-compatible displays.","Impressively for a mainstream-priced 3D Blu-ray player, the S5500 also includes 2D to 3D conversion. This feature simulates the depth of field effect of 3D movies for content produced in 2D. While the quality of 3D conversion is several steps behind content originally produced in 3D, it&#39;s a nice way to get additional use out of your 3D HDTV. During our hands-on testing with the 3D version of the film &#34;Gravity,&#34; we found the player and its menus to be quick and easy to work with.","In terms of software, the Sony has few surprises. During our boot test, in which we timed how long it took for the Blu-ray player to start up, it had a marginally slow mark of 11.4 seconds. By comparison, similar mainstream players had an average boot time of 9.6 seconds. Sony&#39;s operating system has a similar layout to the manufacturer&#39;s PlayStation console, which benefits the playerâ€™s usability. Menus are cleanly designed and easy to navigate through.","Physically, this Sony model falls in line with competing Blu-ray players. With dimensions of 9.1 x 7.6 x 1.5 inches and weight of 1.8 pounds, the player fits nicely into a standard home theater setup, and it&#39;s among the smallest units we reviewed. Standard port options like Wi-Fi support, Ethernet and coaxial audio output are built in to the player and provide useful versatility in your home theater rig. Sony&#39;s TV SideView remote application, which is available on Google and Apple devices, is also a nice touch that helps reduce living room remote clutter.","For technical issues, Sony offers a default one-year warranty on the BDP-S5500. The company also offers support through several channels, including phone and live chat agents."]},"id":"2c71b278-58ef-4ea3-b3a9-cb7474c51e40","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ceded191-1073-4e40-a681-5632bfb8c954","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For mainstream users who want to consume more 3D content, the Sony BDP-S5500 offers strong value.
