If you’re planning on leaving the projector in the same spot, you won’t have to adjust this often beyond the initial adjustment unless it gets bumped. If you’re constantly moving the projector around – on vacation, for instance –you’ll need to adjust each time you move it. These projectors have a focus wheel you can slide with your thumb to adjust.

The inclusion of a battery on many small projectors makes them extra portable. If you’re moving from office to office with the projector, or are always on the go, you probably want one with lengthy battery life. Average projectors have batteries that last between one and two hours while high-end models can go for up to 2.5 hours.","Connectivity<br/>Home users usually only need an HDMI port, but business users benefit from projectors with multiple connection options. If you’re moving between offices or businesses, it’s not guaranteed that you’ll be connecting to a device with modern inputs and outputs. Along with standards like HDMI, business-friendly mini projectors feature options like VGA ports and audio output. A USB port and a microSD slot are nice to have as well, as they allow you to access content from a wider variety of sources. None of the projectors we tested had every single port option we consider to be important, so make sure you know what connection options you need before buying your mini projector.","<strong>What to Watch</strong><br/>Once you’ve chosen your mini projector and have it set up in your home theater – or your car, bedroom or tent – the next task is to find something to watch. Despite their small size, these adorable projectors allow you to watch pretty much anything you want, just like you can on your laptop or smartphone. However, some may require a Wi-Fi connection or a physical connection to your computer to display some media.","Many people don’t know that most of these mini projectors have a small amount of internal storage. For some, this means you can download a video or two to watch no matter how far away you are from a Wi-Fi signal. Other pico projectors use this small space for streaming apps – these projectors allow you to download and install your favorite apps, such as those for Netflix, HBO or ESPN. From here, as long as you’re connected to the internet, you can watch anything available on the apps.","If your projector has a compatible port, you can also connect an external hard drive, flash drive or your computer to view anything those devices have on them or can access online. This is handy if you have your work presentation stored online or if you just want to have a Netflix marathon while you’re camping by the beach.","Remember, though, because of how small they are, these projectors don’t have terrific battery life. If you plan on using yours heavily, we recommend keeping it plugged into a power source like a wall socket or portable battery brick. That way, you don’t have to worry about the battery dying during your favorite movie scene."]},"id":"0b3f5d5d-2f44-4df6-87f5-f6e9877cc99b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"4828b981-8adb-4e0b-bd92-46e7625a29f8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/optoma-intelligo-review\">Optoma IntelliGO-S1</a>","<a href=\"/epson-ex3260-review\">Epson EX3260</a>","<a href=\"/lg-ph550-review\">LG PH550</a>","<a href=\"/optoma-ml750st-review\">Optoma ML750ST</a>","<a href=\"/miroir-review\">Miroir M300A</a>","<a href=\"/aaxa-review\">AAXA M5</a>","<a href=\"/aaxa-p6-review\">AAXA P6</a>","<a href=\"/sony-mp-cd1-review\">Sony MP-CD1</a>","<a href=\"/apeman-review\">Apeman M4</a>","<a href=\"/rif6-review\">RIF6 Cube</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"eb2daeb0-8fb6-4c99-b214-16238a4484d3","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_195","url":"/best-mini-projectors","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-23T21:29:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-23T21:29:00Z","name":"Best Mini Projectors of 2019","synopsis":"We tested a variety of small projectors, ranking them based on picture quality, connectivity, build quality and technical support.","review":{},"strapline":"We tested a variety of small projectors, ranking them based on picture quality, connectivity, build quality and technical support.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-13T21:16:27Z","id":"97ggMzacLUBgfDLqFBM38e","meta":{"title":"Best Mini Projectors 2019 -
