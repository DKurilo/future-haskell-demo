You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Marshall Fridge is a <a href=\"/best-mini-fridges\">compact fridge</a> that looks very much like an electric guitar amplifier. The refrigerator looks every bit like an authentic Marshall amplifier, complete with a gold control panel, black cloth, white lettering and a Jim Marshall signature.","The Marshall Fridge is not just a novelty; it is a fully capable refrigerator. With a capacity of 4.4 cubic feet, it weighs 57 pounds and is 32 inches tall. Therefore, it is light enough to be portable and small enough to fit in tight spaces. It has two leveling legs and a stability bar to keep it stable on any surface. The reversible door design makes it fit for both left- and right-hand use.","While this mini fridge appears to have two sections like a regular guitar amp, the door actually opens up as one piece. There is a top freezer in the main compartment. Even though the freezer takes up the top row, its capacity is only 0.4 cubic feet. The freezer unit is not that roomy, but the rest of the mini fridge is. Inside the main compartment are two glass shelves with spill protectors. One of these is full size, while the other is half size. Both glass shelves divide the main storage compartment into three sections.","The storage sections in the door are also generous. Built into the door of the compact fridge are two racks. The lower rack holds 2-liter bottles, while the top racks hold cans. Beside them, there is also a convenient can storage section that can hold at least eight cans.","Although it houses a compressor, the Marshall Fridge&#39;s cooling unit is well hidden to give the fridge a flush-back design. While the compressor produces only 40 dB of noise, this small fridge can be loud enough to be uncomfortable in quiet rooms. The fridge lacks an interior light.","The Marshall Fridge is a cool homage to the genre and the Lord of Loud. It helps that it is a capable refrigerator too, although it can get loud and a little hot, just like the rock gods it celebrates."]},"id":"8e7c4455-9a06-424b-9b8a-09980c2392da","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62345","url":"/marshall-fridge-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-01-27T22:12:01Z","datePublished":"2015-01-27T22:12:01Z","name":"Marshall Fridge","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-01-27T22:12:01Z","id":"TGiTWCNWjipwTTfwD5xoSK","meta":{"title":"Marshall Fridge Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Marshall Fridge is an excellent mini fridge hiding in the body of a guitar amp.
