Considering how cheap this vacuum is, it receives high marks for its vacuuming performance, convenience and design.","This inexpensive vacuum has a 10-amp motor and a 13-inch cleaning path. In our tests, it didnâ€™t perform as well as the best budget vacuums, but it sufficiently cleaned up flour and kitty litter. We spread pet hair and dander on various surfaces for our pet-hair test. The Dirt Devil Breeze was able to pick up all of it, albeit after a few passes. For something with stronger suction, check out the <a href=\"/hoover-tempo-review\">Hoover Tempo</a>.","One nice feature with this budget vacuum is that if you have hard floors and carpet, like most homes, the vacuum head features a brush roll button that raises and lowers the spinning brushes to optimize cleaning on the type of surface you&#39;re vacuuming.","The Dirt Devil is lightweight for an upright vacuum. The head doesn&#39;t swivel, so you&#39;ll have to move it back and forth to change directions, but the wheels move smoothly and don&#39;t get caught in heavier carpet. Weighing just over 10 pounds, it&#39;s light enough to carry up and down stairs, and when you&#39;re done vacuuming, it fits neatly in the corner of your closet.","The Dirt Devil Breeze has a cyclonic filter that, according to the company, is designed to break up debris in the dust cup for easier cleanup, but that wasn&#39;t our experience. Large clumps of debris got trapped below the filter, making it hard to remove when we cleaned out the 2-liter cup. The vacuum has a long 25-foot power cord, meaning less re-plugging, and the motor is a relatively quiet 87.5 decibels.","For a budget vacuum, the Breeze comes with quite a few tools, all of which are stored on-board. A hose wraps up and around the upright that combines with an extension wand, crevice tool or dusting brush. This gives it the versatility of a canister vacuum with the greater suction power of an upright. One drawback is the lack of an upholstery tool. Other tools can clean couches or chairs, but you&#39;ll need to use more care to not damage the fabric.","Dirt Devil provides a standard one-year warranty on parts and service, and you can use the service center locator page on its website to find a service provider in your area."]},"id":"8ce9957f-c4e7-421a-b69d-00c71fef3958","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6b27fea8-026f-40a6-9600-567f86ba8d51","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dirt Devil Breeze Cyclonic UD70105 is an all-around good budget vacuum with low maintenance costs and solid vacuuming performance.
