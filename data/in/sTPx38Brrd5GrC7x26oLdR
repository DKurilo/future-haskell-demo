Active Junky tested<a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-sleeping-bags\"> sleeping bags</a> on multiple camping trips in Utah and Colorado. They found this down sleeping bag’s unique baffle system a pleasant evolution in design and were further surprised by the economical price tag.","This 20-degree down sleeping bag has 650-fill power white duck down in a 20D nylon lining that is treated to resist moisture. It’s held in place by elastic baffles, a Klymit innovation. The Flex baffles stretch and contract with your movements, allowing you to shift in your sleep without constricting you and keeping a snug fit. The footbox has a half-moon design to allow some freedom for your feet as well. The Active Junky testers appreciated this system in the body of the bag itself, though they found it a little less comfortable in the hood, where the baffle replaces the usual drawstring.","The expanded chest area has a pocket where you can store a phone, wallet or flashlight. In addition, this 20-degree sleeping bag offers a thermal wrap that fits over your shoulders to hold in heat.","The bag weighs just under three pounds and packs into a 13-inch x 8.5-inch bag, making it good for most hikes but not as convenient as ultralight sleeping bags.","The Active Junky testers found this to be a budget sleeping bag excelled in the overall quality and design, especially for the price. Therefore, if you are camping on a budget, it’s a good sleeping bag to consider, but don’t rule it out because other sleeping bags are more expensive. It keeps you warm and packs down relatively well for backpacking or car camping.","<strong>Tester Comment: </strong>It kind of looks like a big trash bag when you pull it out of the stuff sack. But it couldn’t be further from trashy – this thing is a beast. The baffles blew my mind. I slept comfortably, when I wasn’t shaking my head and admiring the design. I’ll be recommending this bag to all of my friends who backpack on a budget.<br/><strong>Key Feature:</strong> Innovation<br/><strong>Best For:</strong> Budget backpacking, new-backpackers, use in bivouacs and rugged camping scenarios.<br/><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Although one of the less expensive bags in our lineup, the Klymit KSB 20 surprises with its warmth and versatility. The innovative elastic baffles and half-moon footbox keep you warm on chilly nights."]},"id":"21e04b92-fbba-455c-bd88-69cfec3db602","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68159","url":"/klymit-ksb-20-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-02T18:57:17Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T18:57:17Z","name":"Klymit KSB 20","synopsis":"Klymit has a reputation for innovation, and its KSB 20 lives up to it.
