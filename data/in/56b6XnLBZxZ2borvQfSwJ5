Simultaneously, its ionization detector is triggered by fast-burning, flaming fires. When combined, this dual-sensor capability provides you with the best possible protection in the event of a fire in your home.

This kind of connectivity is more prevalent in newer homes and may not work in older homes that have not had their electrical system upgraded to modern code. If your home falls into the latter category, you may be better off purchasing wireless smoke detectors that operate on battery power and can be mounted anywhere. You can also speak to an electrician to discuss your options with respect to rewiring your home to facilitate a hardwired smoke alarm system.","Like all hardwired smoke alarms, and some battery-operated units, the Kidde PI2010 supports interconnectivity. This means that when one alarm is triggered, all of them will go off at the same time. This is a critically important feature that could alert you more quickly to a fire in your home, especially if smoke or fire is detected in an area of your home that would otherwise be difficult to hear. This smoke alarm can be interconnected with up to 24 compatible Kidde devices, with a limit of 12 smoke alarms in a single home. Bear in mind that interconnectivity only works with other compatible Kidde devices, such as smoke alarms, CO detectors, heat sensors and strobe lights.","Because the Kidde PI2010 is hardwired, battery power is only used as backup. The unit switches to backup battery power in the event of a power outage in your home and resumes normal electrical operation when power is restored. As a result, battery use is greatly diminished, and you may not have to replace batteries as frequently – still, it is strongly recommended that you replace your smoke detector batteries at a minimum of once every 12 months. This smoke detector requires a single 9-volt battery for backup purposes."]},"id":"e056aa14-27bf-486a-8c39-72ece73b3254","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"88ecdd24-a2f5-4de6-8e34-93d8f41d1b70","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/eEYXNoH7K3DgKB9nQAnW5W.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/66624-kidde-pi201011.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eEYXNoH7K3DgKB9nQAnW5W.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"eEYXNoH7K3DgKB9nQAnW5W","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eEYXNoH7K3DgKB9nQAnW5W.jpg","alt":""},"id":"0f8e2702-6ea0-4040-8fbf-2efc5e610ef1","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When backup battery power runs low, the Kidde PI2010 emits an audible chirp every 45 seconds to remind you to replace the battery.
