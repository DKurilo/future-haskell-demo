If your business is a startup or doesn&#39;t quite meet the bank&#39;s requirements for a conventional loan, a small business loan from an alternative lender may be a viable solution for your funding needs.","However, if your credit is good, you have time to apply and wait for a <a href=\"/money/small-business\">small business loan</a>, the SBA 7(a), can give you better interest rates and longer repayment terms. If you intend to use your loan to purchase real estate or long-term-use equipment, an SBA commercial loan, in conjunction with an SBA CDC loan can provide you with 90% of the financing required for the project and the lowest interest rates. If you need startup business loans or less than $50,000, SBA microloans or alternative microloans are practical options to consider.","<strong>Is an Alternative Business Loan Right for You?</strong>","Alternative business loans are generally smaller than conventional bank loans, with available amounts starting as low as $2,000 and maximum amounts of up to $500,000. Terms are shorter, ranging from one month up to five years. Interest rates are higher than conventional loans, with the best interest rates averaging from 6% to 25%, like <a href=\"#Lending_Club\">Lending Club</a>, whose rates start at 5.9%. However, some alternative lenders may charge much, much higher rates, since alternative lenders aren&#39;t subject to the same regulations as banks.","The biggest benefit of alternative loans is that lenders are eager to lend to small businesses, even those that haven&#39;t been in business for a long time or that have less-than-perfect credit. Because of this, alternative loans are easier to apply for than conventional loans, with shorter, less paperwork-intensive applications; most are online and can be completed in under an hour. For example, <a href=\"#OnDeck\">OnDeck</a> estimates that its application can be completed in as few as 10 minutes. Alternative lenders approve applications quickly, sometimes instantly and usually within a few days, and you can often receive your alternative business financing within a week. Another advantage of alternative business loans is that most can be used for any business-related purpose, from working capital to inventory to equipment purchase. Some, such as <a href=\"#Kabbage\">Kabbage</a>, allow you to draw from the approved loan amount on an as-needed basis, which enables you to use the loan as a business line of credit. The disadvantage of alternative business lending is that it&#39;s more expensive than bank loans.","<strong>Alternative Business Loans: What Should You Look For</strong>","Before you accept any loan offer, it&#39;s important to read the entire contract and ensure that you understand exactly what interest rates, fees, costs and penalties you can expect and that you know exactly how much the loan costs in total, as well as upfront expenditures and daily or monthly payments. You want to be ensure that you understand your obligations and repayment responsibilities, and that you have the means to repay the loan in full and on time.","<strong>Loan Amounts</strong><br/>The dollar amounts available to you varies from lender to lender, with the smallest alternative loans starting at $2,000, and the largest as high as $500,000, although most offer up to $150,000. However, the amount that lenders are willing to extend may depend on your business&#39;s health, which they evaluate using several factors, including your cash flow and your business and personal credit history.","<strong>Interest Rates</strong><br/>Interest rates are higher than you would expect to pay for a conventional loan, and may be expressed as a flat fee instead of a percentage-based interest rate, which can make it confusing to compare against other loan options. Loans with terms of less than a year can also make it difficult to see the actual APR. You can find online calculators that can help you convert the fees and rates to an APR, which gives you a consistent number to use for apples-to-apples comparisons. Be aware that the alternative lenders are not subject to the same regulation as banks and interest rates for some alternative loans may be exorbitant.","<strong>Fees</strong><br/>Most loans include an origination fee of up to 5% of your loan, although most average around 3%. Lenders may also charge an underwriting fee or a maintenance fee. Because fees vary from lender to lender, it&#39;s important to read your contract. If the fees you are quoted differ from the fees in the contract, you want to ensure that the lender updates the contract to reflect the quote they gave you before you accept the loan.","<strong>Repayment Terms</strong><br/>Alternative business loans have much shorter terms than conventional loans. Most offer options of less than a year, with the shortest having a term of just a month and the longest with repayment terms up to five years. The average repayment term is between 12 and 24 months.","If your small business needs a loan in order to take advantage of a time-sensitive opportunity, or if you don&#39;t quite qualify for a conventional loan and need an influx of funds to help your company grow, an alternative business loan can be worth considering. There are many alternative lenders available and they&#39;re eager to lend to small businesses, so it&#39;s well worth your time to shop around and compare your options in order to find the loan with the best rates, the lowest fees and reasonable repayment terms.","<strong>Balboa Capital Review</strong>"]},"id":"4522f8c3-c6a9-40ab-855c-b4a91ed1d54a","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/JVBWEyTBXrzozFtX8cSL6V.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Balboa Capital is an Irvine, California, provider of alternative small business loans.

It does not have a minimum time-in-business requirement, nor does it have a minimum annual sales revenue threshold for qualification. It also does not require collateral for loans.","This online lender offers a 48-hour turnaround time on applications and handles everything electronically, resulting in a simplified lending process. Another nice feature of this lender is that it does not auction off your loan; it is the single source of money for you and your business.","SnapCap&#39;s average loan term is under a year, although the maximum can be up to 18 months, according to its online loan calculator. With the calculator, you input your credit score, loan length and amount. You can then review your monthly payments, total repayments and savings compared to traditional business loans. Loans through SnapCap have a maximum amount of $250,000 and repayment terms up to 18 months. SnapCap&#39;s loans have a fixed interest rate, but you&#39;ll need to speak with one of their representatives as the company does not list specific rates on its site.","This alternative business lender analyzes your company&#39;s performance to approve the loan. Even though the company promises a 48-hour turnaround time, the higher your loan request, the longer approval may take – up to three days. You do not need to submit tax forms, but you do need to provide bank statements.","Small businesses across the nation have used this alternative business financing institution to secure loans ranging from equipment and inventory to general purpose cash. In fact, SnapCap offers four types of loans groups under the categories of general purpose, inventory, equipment and expansion. Regardless of the purpose, the features are the same and include quick processing time and competitive interest rates.","An added plus for startups and entrepreneurs just starting out is that all of SnapCap&#39;s loans are regulated, and they provide reporting to the major credit bureaus, an important step for those wanting to establish and build strong business credit.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong>The Business Backer Review</strong>"]},"id":"3400d825-d74b-40a9-aace-f0a96a88e002","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/cVW4gruFbk7yjmiva2YuY.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Business Backer is a small business financing institution that offers alternative loans and other financing methods to qualified businesses.

You can choose graduated or deferred monthly payments, which could be useful if you have seasonal fluxes in your income. This loan also comes with automatic preapproval for future financing.
