This software is compatible with varying skill levels and is easy to use, which was apparent in my hands-on tests. While there are plenty of organizing features, it focuses more on <a href=\"/best-photo-editing-software\">photo editing</a> tools and lacks some helpful tagging features.","<strong>File Management<br/></strong>After I tagged a bunch of photos, the program reordered the selection into several categories, including date, filename, file format and size. I was impressed by how quickly this allowed me to organize the photos. The software also offers facial recognition, but like most other photo manager programs, it makes you manually tag the people in your images. You can also use this feature to tag multiple photos of the same person; however, the face tagging is not foolproof. In testing, the software mistakenly saw faces in scenery or clothing and automatically tagged them, so I had to go through and make sure the photos it tagged were correct.","This program did not let me add color labels to our photos to help group them by theme. I was able to label and organize images by location, date and customizable categories, but the program was more limiting than others I used. PaintShop Pro has a lot of tools at your disposal, which means it could take some time to master them all. However, since the interface is easy to navigate and the tools are so effective, the time spent learning it will pay off.","<strong>Editing &amp; Extras<br/></strong>While the photo organizer lacks some capabilities, this software excels when it comes to standard and advanced editing tools. The editing features are similar to high-end editing programs but are easier to use, and you won&#39;t have to pay nearly as much to use them. In addition to using drawing, selection and shape tools, I was able to crop, resize and even remove unwanted objects from photos. Suntan and Thinify, two cosmetic tools, allowed me to enhance our photos by removing zits and reducing wrinkles. I was pleased with the results the editing tools provided, especially since the program worked in layers and offered a range of brush options.","You can also use the photo blend tool to combine similar photos into one new image. This tool is similar to <a href=\"/photo-director-review\">PhotoDirector&#39;s</a> Face Swap tool, as it helps you weed out unwanted objects from your photo or swap out blinking eyes for open ones.","<strong>Sharing<br/></strong>This program let me share photos directly from the software by posting photo albums to Facebook, Google+, SmugMug and Flickr, as well as by emailing. However, I was disappointed to find that I couldn&#39;t create slideshows using this software.","<strong>Help &amp; Support<br/></strong>Help resources are found on Corel&#39;s website, including tutorials, a user forum and a FAQs page. You can also call or email representatives with questions. When I used Corel&#39;s live chat, the person who assisted me was polite and very helpful.","Most photo manager software focuses on organizing with some photo editing tools on the side. However, PaintShop Pro is a full-featured photo editor with some additional organizing capabilities. It has standard tools for managing photos, including keyword tags, auto sorting and facial recognition to help you sort your images in various ways."]},"id":"185b0398-280b-4bfa-b40e-a394ba7e2c03","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60512","url":"/paintshop-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-09-15T22:34:54Z","datePublished":"2014-09-15T22:34:54Z","name":"Corel PaintShop Pro 2019","synopsis":"Corel’s PaintShop Pro is a good photo manager as well as a powerful editor for photographers.","review":{"rating":80,"verdict":"PaintShop Pro has a wide selection of advanced editing features that can compensate for the basic organizational tools this software has to offer.","pros":["This program has a mixture of standard and professional-grade editing tools."],"cons":["The software lacks some sorting tools, such as color labels."]},"strapline":"Corel’s PaintShop Pro is a good photo manager as well as a powerful editor for photographers.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-13T00:00:00Z","id":"yrbUxWqaucAwuYpYJwRPyi","meta":{"title":"PaintShop Pro Ultimate Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"PaintShop Pro 2018 has a wide selection of advanced editing features that can compensate for the basic organizational tools this software has to offer."},"products":[{"slug":"corel-paintshop-pro-2019","url":"/product/corel-paintshop-pro-2019","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:55:09Z","name":"Corel PaintShop Pro 2019","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:55:09Z","id":"wV3vjZqm7XiTXi5yaXAhr","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T18:55:09Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/f9U4zQzNewvH357PFvfLTm.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:55:09Z","mimeType":"","name":"ff09f2560d8ad56f663242d48ab62f15.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/ff09f2560d8ad56f663242d48ab62f15.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:55:09Z","id":"f9U4zQzNewvH357PFvfLTm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f9U4zQzNewvH357PFvfLTm.jpg","alt":""},"title":"PaintShop Pro Ultimate Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"PaintShop Pro 2018 has a wide selection of advanced editing features that can compensate for the basic organizational tools this software has to offer."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/f9U4zQzNewvH357PFvfLTm.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:55:09Z","mimeType":"","name":"ff09f2560d8ad56f663242d48ab62f15.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/ff09f2560d8ad56f663242d48ab62f15.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:55:09Z","id":"f9U4zQzNewvH357PFvfLTm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f9U4zQzNewvH357PFvfLTm.jpg","alt":""},"title":"PaintShop Pro Ultimate Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"PaintShop Pro 2018 has a wide selection of advanced editing features that can compensate for the basic organizational tools this software has to offer."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/software/multimedia/best-photo-manager-software/paintshop-pro-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:55:09Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:55:09Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"photo-software","url":"/hobbies/photo-software","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:55:09Z","name":"Photo Software","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:55:09Z","id":"VW4y9RdMbVZFvSGe6M26Kb","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
