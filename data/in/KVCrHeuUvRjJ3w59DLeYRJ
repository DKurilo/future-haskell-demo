While it does keep track of where each asset is, it also optimizes design and reminds businesses when certain assets need to be maintained. Further, it provides techniques that are helpful in commissioning assets and replacing them. Many also help keep track of warranties on assets. Some popular types of this software include <a href=\"#SAP\">SAP</a>, <a href=\"#IFS\">IFS</a> and <a href=\"#Mintek_Transcendent\">Mintek Transcendent</a>.","Aside from helping companies manage assets throughout their life cycle, another benefit to this software is its ability to track and manage all items wherever they are located, even in different facilities, departments or geographical locations. All of these benefits reduce labor, production and maintenance costs, while limiting downtime and increasing productivity.","<strong>Enterprise Asset Management: What to Look For</strong>","Choosing EAM software can help businesses in many ways. However, there are several important factors to think about before making a decision on which software is the right choice. Companies need to consider what industries and processes the software is useful for, whether any special editions are available for customized use and if the system can be used with any other technologies.","<strong>Industries &amp; Processes</strong><br/>Most asset management services support asset operations, such as tracking check-ins and checkouts of assets, scheduling maintenance and managing contracts pertaining to assets. Some systems are better geared to certain industries and processes than others. When a company is looking for this type of software, it should consider carefully what industries the software manufacturer says the solution would work best for. Some solutions might work for any asset-intensive industry, while others might only be appropriate for the food industry or oil industry. By choosing a product made specifically for the industry they are in, businesses can get more from the software. Industries can include manufacturing, health care, the public sector and hospitality.","<strong>Special Editions</strong><br/>Special editions of the asset management software let companies focus on the specific needs of their industry. Each industry is different; the management needs of the public sector may focus on preventative maintenance to equipment, while the needs of the manufacturing industry may be reducing energy waste and unplanned downtime. Special editions of this software give companies the flexibility necessary to meet industry-specific requirements and improve management of their assets.","<strong>Use With Other Technologies</strong><br/>Some systems let companies use other types of technology along with the software. Cloud computing solutions, Microsoft Dynamics and enterprise resource planning systems are just a few of the technologies that may be integrated with a facilities management system. Businesses may also be given the option of uploading documents such as warranties and contracts and attaching them to the asset.","<strong>Mobile Capability</strong><br/>Mobile capability is an important feature included with many EAM solutions. This feature lets companies add assets and asset parts to the software when a worker is away from a computer. It is also beneficial to employees and subcontractors in the field who need access to safety instructions, part numbers and work orders when conducting maintenance on an asset.","Finding the right management software for physical assets can help companies track and manage important pieces of equipment throughout their life cycle. Doing so can reduce maintenance costs, eliminate downtime and improve productivity.

It does this by helping prevent asset breakdowns, improving the productivity and efficiency of employees and subcontractors and helping companies keep track of movable assets.","To do this, it provides companies with several features, including integration with Microsoft Dynamics AX. The system uses its own analytical technology to determine how much a piece of equipment, a truck or any other physical asset has been used. It then determines, based on the amount of time the asset has been used, whether preventative maintenance is required. If it is, the software automatically sends out a work order for the asset. It then delivers this information into Microsoft Dynamics AX, utilizing its planning, purchasing and inventory capabilities.","Another important feature of this asset management service is spare parts management. This tool uses information scheduled in the system regarding maintenance and then analyzes whether the parts required for those operations are available. If they&#39;re not, the AX purchasing capability is used to buy new materials or parts.","When it comes to asset management, companies must be able to use their mobile devices in conjunction with the right software. This system features mobile field service for workers to use outside the office. The application lets you record and manage work orders as they are happening, request new parts for your company&#39;s physical assets, record what spare parts were used in a maintenance situation and record labor time.","This system works best with industries such as construction, manufacturing and government contracting. But it&#39;s possible to monitor any physical asset, including fleets, real estate and equipment.","If you&#39;re looking for EAM software for your company, this solution features the ability to monitor, track and completely manage your assets and their parts. Working in conjunction with Microsoft Dynamics, it orders new parts for you, automates work orders and even analyzes when the assets need maintenance. It supports mobile field service as well.","<a href=\"#Back_to_Top\">Back to Top </a>"]},"id":"5cd18116-3583-43e3-8ba8-2834a3d9ca7c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10276","url":"/best-enterprise-asset-management-software-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-22T03:09:06Z","datePublished":"2016-11-22T03:09:06Z","name":"Best Enterprise Asset Management Software Review","synopsis":"Enterprise asset management (EAM) is a software solution that helps companies manage their physical assets.","review":{},"strapline":"Enterprise asset management (EAM) is a software solution that helps companies manage their physical assets.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-11-22T20:02:26Z","id":"KVCrHeuUvRjJ3w59DLeYRJ","meta":{"title":"Best Enterprise Asset Management Software Review","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
