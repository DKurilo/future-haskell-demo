The optics, while not the best available, are still very serviceable, and this works well as a microscope for students as well as kids. While it lacks extra equipment and a carrying case, it boasts some significant features.","When we tested this microscope, we were able to see a small sample of denim better than on most of our other models, showing that it has considerable optical power. However, when we tested the microscope&#39;s overall optical capabilities, it had one of the lower scores in our review, mostly because it just does not show some of the objects as clearly as others. While some samples were very clear, others were very blurred.","This model doesn&#39;t come with much in the way of additional equipment. The kit does not include tweezers, slide covers or specimen cutters. Its lack of equipment makes it more suited to students who use prepared samples on slides than to kids who want to experiment and prepare their own samples.","The Dino-Lite AM2111 is easy to use, despite the lack of supplementary material. The light illuminates the slides well, and it is easy to get images on the microscope’s camera. There are only a few shortcomings, such as the lack of a protective carrying case. This is an important feature on a children&#39;s microscope, given the bumps, scratches and drops often involved. It is also not cordless, requiring you to be near an electrical outlet when you use it.","The manufacturer&#39;s support services bolster this set’s appeal considerably. It has a telephone service you can call during business hours, and an email service in case you don’t mind waiting a little longer for an answer. The Dino-Lite site also offers live chat, which connects you to a company representative during business hours. The microscope has a two-year warranty."]},"id":"2407a486-83c1-41b2-85bd-5e272151415e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9270ccaa-4cb4-4ced-89a9-4c531e5e8b1b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dino-Lite AM2111 microscope doesn&#39;t include extra equipment for a budding scientist, and there&#39;s no protective case for the device.
