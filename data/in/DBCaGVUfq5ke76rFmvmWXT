Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Skullcandy headphones are generally targeted at people involved in outdoor action sports, like snowboarding or skateboarding, but the Aviator&#39;s classic style and design appeals to music lovers of all activity levels. Not only do the Skullcandy Aviator <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">stereo headphones</a> sound good, they faithfully reproduce your music and look great.","The sound performance of the Aviators is good, falling precisely into the frequency range of 20 to 20,000Hz, the average range of hearing for humans. The Skullcandy Aviators excel with the high- and mid-range frequencies, but the low bass frequencies are not quite as strong as we like to see from headphones in this category. Your music is crisp and clear, and with some adjustment from an equalizer, you may be able to boost the bass to a level you enjoy. The Aviators are perfect for listening to music on your portable music player, phone or laptop, thanks to their low 34 ohm impedance.","One of the best features of the Aviator headset is that the audio cable can detach. A 4.3-foot cable with a built-in mic and volume control comes standard with this headset. Made with Apple iOS devices in mind, this cable gives you complete control without having to touch your iPod, iPhone or iPad. The audio cable is covered in braided nylon, increasing the cable&#39;s lifespan and giving it greater resilience to tangling. One nice thing about a headset with a detachable cable is if you ever need to replace it, you do not have to open your headphones to fix the problem.","Created with music junkies in mind, the Aviator headphones were made to be durable, stylish and comfortable. Skullcandy Aviator headphones are over-the-ear headphones made from high quality polycarbonate, leather and metal materials. The only design flaw we noticed is how small this headset is compared to other stereo headphones. If you have a larger-than-average head, you may be disappointed that the Skullcandy Aviator headphones do not expand very far. The earcups are made from sturdy polycarbonate and fold up for easy transporting. The earpads are made from comfy memory foam and are covered in soft leather. The Aviator headset only weighs 7.05 ounces and rests comfortably on your ears and head for long listening sessions. Using this headset to DJ would not be the best choice as the Aviator headphone earcups do not swivel or rotate.","Skullcandy Aviator headphones come with a nice leather carrying case that holds the headset and cable with just enough room to carry a smaller MP3 player or iPod. We are impressed with the portability of this headset and would like to see other stereo headphones be able to fold up.","Skullcandy has always stood behind their products and provides a limited lifetime warranty for all their products. If you do have a problem or question, you can contact Skullcandy by email or phone. There is also a FAQs page on the Skullcandy support webpage."]},"id":"4845a9d1-60b1-4652-a522-8c3fe5b7dafb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6c10927f-d896-441f-9381-54acb95ef28f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Skull Candy Aviator headphones are a great sounding, high quality headset.
