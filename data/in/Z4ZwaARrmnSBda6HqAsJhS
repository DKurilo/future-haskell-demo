Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The HP Color LaserJet CP3525dn is a <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a> that offers excellent print quality. The high resolution, monthly duty cycle and fast speeds are a few of the standout features available on this device. This laser printer offers a wide variety of advanced features, making it the perfect device for either an office or a home environment. However, the hefty design may be a drawback in a smaller work environment.","One of the highlights of the CP3525dn is the 1200 x 600 dpi (dots per inch) maximum resolution. This printer offers vivid colors, sharp edges and impressive print consistency. This laser printer also features a monthly duty cycle of 75,000. This means you can print up to 75,000 pages a month without causing any serious damage to the device.","The printing speeds available on the CP3525dn are another advantage to using this device. This printer features a fast printing speed of 30 pages per minute for black and white and color prints. And in addition, an automatic duplex setting is available on the device. Using this feature, the printer will print on two sides of the same sheet of paper without having to turn each sheet over manually.","Many of the features you will find on the HP CP3525dn are ideal for an office setting. Several of the features offered on this device are powerful enough they can handle frequent use. For example, the paper tray available on this laser printer can hold up to 250 sheets of paper. This eliminates the need to stock the paper tray on a daily basis. It also can print on a variety of paper sizes such as labels and envelopes to paper as large as 8.5 x 14 inches.","There are 384MB of installed memory available on the CP3525dn, which is one of the largest amounts of memory we saw on a laser printer. There are no wireless printing capabilities, which is a large drawback to the CP3525dn. However, there is Ethernet and one USB port for connectivity and networking. This device is ENERGY STAR qualified but uses 643 watts of power while printing.","The HP CP3525dn is not a compact laser printer. This device is 20.2 inches wide, 14.1 inches tall and 19.3 inches deep. The broad dimensions of the laser printer unfortunately mean the it will take up a large amount of space on a desk or table. And this laser printers weighs 72.5 pounds, making it difficult to move from one area to another. Although, despite its large size, this printer is easy to use. A display screen, along with only a handful of controls is located on the right-hand side of the device. This small control panel gives the device an easy-to-use interface."]},"id":"89bb1ede-e129-48fd-90b6-f297a3eec09c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9c5e094f-eab3-4953-9dbb-11e84c99e17b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>HP Color LaserJet CP3525dn</strong> may be a large laser printer but it offers excellent features and outstanding printing capabilities.
