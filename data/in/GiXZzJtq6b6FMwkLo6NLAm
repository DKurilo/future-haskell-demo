This espresso machine uses 1350 watts of power to pump as many as four shots of espresso at a time. If you use the dual dispenser, you can fill two espresso cups at once. The body is made of stainless steel and looks sharp. The internal parts are made from aluminum so the EC50 isn&#39;t very heavy. It weights only about eight pounds.","The EC50 can keep its temperature hot once it heats up. This lets you toggle between making espresso and steaming milk without having to wait for additional warm up time between each. You can easily steam milk with the EC50 steam wand. It swivels out away from the machine so that you can use larger frothing cups.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"fec52f91-5e18-445a-b5d5-b5eb5fd3e00c","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This cappuccino machine has a clear, removable water tank. This makes it easy to see the fill lines so you don&#39;t accidentally over fill it. You can also see if you need to ass more water before you use it. Since it holds up to 42 ounces of water, you won&#39;t have to fill the tank before each shot.","The space between the dispenser and the drop tray is very small. Only short cups will be able to fit there to catch the coffee. The drip tray is removable for easy cleaning in between brewing. The EC50 has an auto-rinse feature. The internal parts of the cappuccino machine automatically clean themselves while you steam milk, which helps maintain the life of your machine.","It is important not to overfill the filters with coffee grounds and to ensure that the grounds are evenly packed. The EC50 cappuccino maker doesn&#39;t come with a measuring tool or a tamping tool, so you will have to purchase those separately. This espresso machine isn&#39;t able to brew from espresso pods.","Capresso included some great safety measures on the EC50. The on/off indicator light will help you and others know when the espresso maker is on and hot. The short cord will reduce the risk of children being able to pull the unit on themselves, while the polarized plug can help reduce the possibility of electric shock.","Capresso gives every support option available to its customers. Telephone and email address are easy to find online. Support techs are quick to respond to inquiries on the Capresso Facebook page. You can even download user guides to help you with basic troubleshooting questions."]},"id":"c3a308c9-fae7-4498-b817-d0d03515f64a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"be27303f-7dbc-4e53-a41c-0c4f64a2aec1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Capresso EC series uses steam pressure to brew espresso.
