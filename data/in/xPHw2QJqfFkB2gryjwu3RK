This is one of the only products in our comparison that recognized all the raw photo formats we tested, which makes it good for serious photographers looking to recover photos from DSLR cameras.","To evaluate GetData’s Recover My Photos, we simulated two common data loss scenarios: lost files through accidental deletion, and a reformatted rive. In both tests, which we performed on an HDD, SSD and SD card, we tried to recover raster, vector, production and raw images. While GetData posted high recovery rates for each file type during the lost file test, it didn’t do a great job recovering files from reformatted drives."]},"id":"2fb6b49e-19c2-4326-95de-481bbe750e42","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/dtfP4fKeZPzw32wkzed2G4.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"In the lost file test, Recover My Photos rescued 100 percent of the JPG images, which is critically important because most photos are JPGs. The recovery rate for the other raster images (TIG, GIF, BMP and PNG) was 84 percent. This is 14 percentage points above average. It recovered 90 percent of the vector images, which was the highest vector recovery rate in our tests. It also retrieved production images and camera raw images at a rate of 83 percent and 82 percent, respectively. Both of these rates are among the best we found.
