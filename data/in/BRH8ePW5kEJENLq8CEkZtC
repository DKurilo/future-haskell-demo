Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The ability to move air is an important feature for any <a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">window air conditioning unit</a>, and the LG LW8015ER is very good at it. It can move more than 250 cubic feet of air per minute, more than any other product in our window air conditioner reviews. That means it can cool a sticky and hot room in a very short amount of time.","This window AC unit also has an excellent energy efficiency ratio of 11.3. That is the second best in our comparison behind the <a href=\"/danby-dac060eub5gdb-review\">Danby DAC060EUB5GDB</a>. It means running this unit will be relatively inexpensive. This product uses up to 8,000 British thermal units (Btu) – the amount of energy needed to heat or cool 1 pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit. That means it can tackle a little bit bigger room than the others we considered, so this is a good option if you have a room that is about 350 square feet.","The LG unit has the highest rate of moisture removal in our comparison at 2.2 pints per hour, which makes it great if you live in a humid climate. There is also a dehumidify mode so you can get rid of the moisture in the air even if you do not want to change the temperature of the air at the same time.","A variety of operating modes will help this unit meet your needs, for energy savings and for comfort. The energy saver mode uses the fan to extend the coolness created by the compressor. The fan will automatically turn on about every three minutes in order to maintain the ideal temperature for the room. A sleeping mode is lacking on this model but you can use the timer feature to shut the unit off in a designated number of hours so you do not wake up to an overly cold room.","This unit is covered for one year on all parts, including the compressor. LG is reachable by email, telephone and live chat if you have questions about warranty coverage or anything else."]},"id":"a3df0b85-2ef6-408b-94f1-11e5c2f838c9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3f87a43a-ae54-4e6f-b861-1202bfcb780b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" A sleep mode is notably missing, but this window air conditioner has almost every other feature we were looking for.
