Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","In the world of <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> systems TomTom is a name brand that many have come to recognize and love for navigating around the world. The TomTom XXL 540S offers a relatively large screen, traffic services, voice recognition, lane assist and much more.","The TomTom XXL 540S has a feature which truly makes saving time on travel much easier than it ever has been in the past. TomTom’s 24/7 IQ Routes allow you to drive like a local no matter what town or city you find yourself in. During the day one route to and from work may be much faster than if you were to try and take that same route a few hours later. This is based off of traffic, school zones, traffic lights, stop signs and any other potential issue that could cause one way to be slower than another depending on the time of day. The TomTom XXL 540S navigation GPS will automatically figure out the best route based on over 800 billion road speed profiles that they have gathered over the years.","If you have to travel for more than a few miles to get to work you know how frustrating it can be when unexpected traffic causes you to be late for work or getting home for dinner. For $60 a year you can get an upgrade to Live Traffic, which will alert you of accidents and other delays on your route. The few extras bucks can save you time and in some cases even a little extra money.","Buying a navigation GPS system for the most part means you want the best instructions on how to get where you are going without running into a lot of problems along the way. If you are the kind of person who does not live in a big city you will find it a job in and of itself to get around. TomTom’s lane guidance helps anyone work their way through the spaghetti bowl of roads that the majority of large cities have created to get from point a to point b. Knowing which exit to take or which lane to be in to head north or south can mean the difference between going to the local amusement park or heading to the middle of nowhere. Another feature that is becoming standard in all modern navigation GPS systems is that it has spoken instructions and street names. This allows you to keep your eyes on the road and not on the GPS trying to figure out where you are supposed to turn or which exit to take. A built in speaker on the back of the TomTom XXL 540S is large enough so sound quality is crystal clear.","One of the most important things to have on your navigation GPS is up to date and accurate maps of the places you are planning on visiting. TomTom has found a way to have the most up to date maps possible and that is by using the manpower of the dedicated customers. Anyone who has the “Map Share” technology on their GPS can submit changes to roads, signs, speed limits or any other change so that TomTom’s workers can verify the information and make the change.","The TomTom XXL 540S has this features and allows you to help keep everyone up to date. It also allows provides you with the best and most accurate maps possible. This is crucial when something happens and you need to get somewhere fast or there is an emergency. The TomTom XXL 540S also has a built-in feature called “Help Me!” which allows you to phone for help, drive to help, tells you the exact location of where you are and even has first aid guides in case someone gets hurt.","The reason some people decide to get a navigation GPS system is so they can get out of town and see the world around them. If you are looking into getting the TomTom XXL 540S for this purpose then you’ll be more than happy with the results. Now you can plan your vacation on your navigation GPS and know how long it will take, where you are going to sleep, the best places to eat and even find places to stop and visit along the way. With over 7 million POIs, or points of interest, the TomTom XXL 540S truly is the ultimate navigation GPS for exploring the world around you without missing a single thing along the way.","If by chance the TomTom XXL 540S doesn’t have the location you are looking for simply access TomTom HOME and download additional POIs to see if they have the one you are looking for. If in your travels you find something you have to go and visit again, simply save the route so that a few years down the road you can revisit the same place, or even better yet, share it with others so they can have just as much fun as you did."]},"id":"65efc0a5-e002-4c0c-8c4d-b94557be7678","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3bca7e6d-799d-4e03-b31f-cafe2ad080f5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["TomTom has designed their navigation GPS systems to not only provide accurate and user friendly navigational systems but have also added a price that can’t be beat.
