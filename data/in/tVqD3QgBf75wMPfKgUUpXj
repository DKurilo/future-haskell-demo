The features that the Swissmar Biel Copper Fondue Set offers can help make your first or next fondue experience a fun and easy one.","The design of this 11-piece fondue set is unique. The pot has a traditional design with a hammered mirror finish, which looks elegant and classic combined with its brilliant copper hue. It is made of copper-plated stainless steel 0.8 mm thick, which makes it good for making meat fondues, since copper provides even heat distribution. The even-heating copper construction makes this pot excellent for cooking at both high and low temperatures. The tapered opening helps the heat stay inside the pot, which allows the oil or broth to remain above 350 degrees Fahrenheit without spattering on the rechaud or table.","While this pot is excellent for cooking meats, it is also great for one-pot dishes such as chili, soups, Swedish meatballs, veggie dips and cheese fondue. You can remove the splatter ring for easy access to stir and dip the forks in the pot. This set is not electric, though, so you need to stay stocked with fuel for the burner.","This copper fondue set adds style and class to any party with its gleaming copper color and hammered mirror finish. Though the copper plating looks bright and beautiful when you purchase it, however, copper can change color over time, growing dimmer with wear and tear, though this won&#39;t affect the superior heat distribution of the material.","In addition to the pot, this 11-piece set contains a copper-plated fondue burner, splatter guard, a portable stove called a rechaud, six color-coded forks and a recipe card. You can separately purchase accessories, such as a fondue recipe book or a set of four Raclette round plates, can be purchased separately.","The Swissmar Biel Copper Fondue Set&#39;s copper plating is both attractive and efficient, heating your food quickly and evenly. This fondue pot&#39;s ease of use and 11 pieces to accommodate the specific dish you want makes it unique and a great choice for a stylish new addition to your kitchen and parties."]},"id":"232cd1ab-eb26-4d9a-968b-7a79023d729d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61621","url":"/swissmar-biel-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-16T17:19:31Z","datePublished":"2014-12-16T17:19:31Z","name":"Swissmar Biel 11-PC Copper Fondue Set","synopsis":"Since recently expanding its product line to include fondue sets, Swissmar has helped in bringing back this popular 1960s dish.
