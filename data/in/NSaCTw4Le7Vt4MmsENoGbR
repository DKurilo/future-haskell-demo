Recording streaming video is something that internet users can do with just a few clicks and the proper video recording software. The next time you want to record a song with graphics, capture that funny video for a friend or remember something interesting that was published on the web, consider these helpful tips for recording online streaming videos.","<strong>Obtain the Best Software</strong>","Some of the biggest worries that many potential recorders have are how much the software will cost and whether or not it will meet their recording needs. The good news is that most video recording software is rather affordable, but it ultimately depends on what needs you have. Some of the <a href=\"/best-video-capture-software\">best video capture software</a> available, like Adobe, costs under $500; however, many good programs suitable for amateur use cost less than $50, and some programs are free. Higher-ticket applications generally work better for more voluminous recording needs, while someone who just wants to record a few clips can benefit from the free software.","<strong>Determine Your Resolution</strong>","It is important to make sure you understand what type of streaming video resolution your PC supports. By right-clicking on your desktop, you&#39;ll see numbers indicating which resolution your computer supports: 240p, 480p, 720p or 1080p. These numbers represent the resolution of the video that you are streaming, as well as the resolution of your capture. The lowest and grainiest video quality belongs to 240p resolution, while 1080p is the highest and sharpest. Pick a streaming video recorder that is compatible with your PC&#39;s resolution and recording capabilities.","<strong>Upload Your Video </strong>","If you are using a Windows PC, you can simply transfer your recording to another device, such as a TV, with a USB or mini-USB cable. Programs such as Windows Movie Maker allow you to choose the clips you want in your video by dragging them onto a storyboard. When you can see your clips on the board, it becomes easier to segment and upload. There are also programs available that are compatible with Mac computers, and most of them perform functions similar to Windows Movie Maker.","One thing you may want to do is upload your capture to YouTube. YouTube recording software allows you to format the video as .avi, .wmv, MPG or MP4 files for a wider range of compatibility. You can download or upload any video with these file extensions to YouTube.","<strong>Compress the File</strong>","If you&#39;re sending the video, remember that video clips are sizeable, so instead of uploading or emailing huge files, use a Zip program to compress the file. Zipping allows you to send the file via the internet in less time.","The best way to record a streaming video is to have a great idea in mind before you begin recording.  From there, it&#39;s as simple as having your phone or webcam plugged in and shooting your video."]},"id":"3a0ec067-b64e-4b3c-82ba-0641cb2910ac","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9163","url":"/how-to-record-streaming-video-online","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-24T17:07:37Z","datePublished":"2015-02-24T17:07:37Z","name":"How to Record Streaming Video Online","synopsis":"If you've never recorded video from your computer for personal use or for the entertainment of family and friends, the process is easy to learn.","review":{},"strapline":"If you've never recorded video from your computer for personal use or for the entertainment of family and friends, the process is easy to learn.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-24T17:13:11Z","id":"NSaCTw4Le7Vt4MmsENoGbR","meta":{"title":"How to Record Streaming Video Online","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
