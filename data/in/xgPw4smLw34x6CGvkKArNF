You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Playskool Showcam <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">kids&#39; digital camera</a> will have your child anxious to be the photographer at all of your family gatherings. This camera comes with many of the features found on real digital cameras, but it also includes some kid-only fun to keep your children entertained for hours. It&#39;s built to be kid-tough, and the picture resolution is decent for a children&#39;s digital camera.","We gave this camera high marks for durability. It is big and bulky, as you would expect a quality kids&#39; digital camera to be. Each side of the Showcam has comfortable grips that help your little one keep a firm grasp on the camera. It is made from heavy plastic, with all important components safely tucked deep inside. A few bumps and thumps won&#39;t be able to jiggle anything loose.","This kids&#39; digital camera requires four AA alkaline batteries, so replacing them isn&#39;t difficult and you don&#39;t have to interrupt playtime for too long waiting for rechargeable batteries to power back up. The Showcam has an automatic shut-off feature to keep your camera batteries working longer.","The Playskool Showcam digital camera for kids has an amazing storage capacity. This camera can hold up to 1,000 images. The pics have a resolution of 2 megapixels, which is great for a children&#39;s camera. This camera isn&#39;t able to capture video, but it does have a unique playback feature: a built-in projector that lets your child create his or her own slideshow on any surface, making your little photographer the life of any family gathering. This is also a fun way for your child to stay occupied after the fun of snapping pictures has worn off.","It would have been nice to see this camera include flash and zoom abilities, but even without them, this camera is close enough to a real digital camera to satisfy most young children. Playskool does include a view screen on the Showcam digital camera. This lets your child view pictures right on the camera. If you purchase a USB cable, you can also upload the pictures to any PC to edit, share or print for display. This camera also has built-in photo-editing capabilities, so you don&#39;t have to upload pictures in order to touch them up.","One fun feature of the Showcam is the photo effects. Your child can add more than 50 creative touches, such as wild hair and sunglasses, to photographs. These effects can be saved and projected with the camera&#39;s projector to give another layer of creativity to your child&#39;s imagination. While this kids&#39; camera doesn&#39;t have games, the fun photo effects and the photo projector provide some fun and variety compared to a plain old digital camera.","Though they are difficult to find, Playskool does offer several customer support options. The Showcam comes with a user guide that is also available online. Playskool has a small FAQs section on its website. If you look hard enough, you can find both email and telephone contact information. Playskool has a very limited warranty, only 60 days. This warranty is really a basic return policy, but there aren&#39;t too many restrictions for returning the product if you are not completely satisfied."]},"id":"54ce9d70-ddb1-4203-b72b-35cbd42b8065","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"37402c45-8a0a-4ddd-800d-5911638a5aab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Playskool Showcam is a fun little digital camera for kids.
