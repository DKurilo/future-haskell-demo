You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","My Banking Direct is an online-only bank that has a diverse selection of options. <a href=\"/best-online-only-banks\">Online banks</a> typically offer the same services that traditional banks often have, and My Banking Direct is no different. Look for high interest rates for savings accounts with large balances and no fees for checking accounts when looking for an online bank. However, unlike other online banking institutions, this online bank has a $100 deposit and monthly minimum to avoid fees in the savings accounts.","Most people are familiar with traditional banking options. The concept is extremely simple and easy to grasp. A bank holds money and keeps it safe. However, My Banking Direct, and most other traditional banks, have much more to offer. The checking account offered with this online banking establishment is terrific. There are no minimum deposits or fees associated with the accounts.","Using this internet only bank is simpler than using a traditional bank, in many ways. Depositing money with online banking is done in a variety of ways. Some common ways to move funds into your account are to enter check information into the computer, use money orders or do money transfers. The most common and easy way to transfer money into your online banking account is to use a direct deposit feature. Many employers have a free direct deposit option that will automatically transfer your paycheck into your bank account.","Withdrawing money is also quick and simple with online banking. After applying for an account, you will have checks and an ATM/debit card delivered to you, much like traditional banks. You’ll be able to use the checks just like any other check from a regular bank. Plus, the ATM/debit card will function just like any other card and can be used in any machine and shopping online without any fees. However, some ATM machines charge independent fees, which are not a part of the bank.","The savings accounts deposits and withdraws work very similar to the checking account options. However, there is a minimum deposit and a monthly minimum balance of $100 for your savings accounts. This is extremely high compared to most other options offered by most other only banking institutions. There are plenty of online banks that are free to use and require no deposit or monthly balance.","The bank advertizes on its website an interest rate of a whopping 1.25 percent, which would be fantastic. However, to qualify for that rate, you have to deposit and keep at least $5,000 in your savings account. This online bank has a tiered interest rate system and you can expect a different rate based on the amount of money you deposit.","Because My Banking Direct is a subsidiary of the New York Community Bank, it has all the FDIC protections and other security measures in place. All your deposits, up to $250,000 are automatically backed up and safe. The site also employs all the necessary encryption codes and security measures to protect your money.","Contacting the customer support team is simple and quick. You can send the representatives an email or call them on a toll-free number. We were able to find quick and easy answers to all of our questions."]},"id":"ed3d5f6b-4675-4495-a513-114232692f25","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f596ae8f-9022-4d55-a758-b80cbe257071","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["My Banking Direct<strong> </strong>is a secure institution for depositing your money. The checking account is free and has no deposit or monthly minimum requirements. However, the savings accounts have a more complicated tiered system with minimum requirements to avoid fees. Also, don’t get too excited about the advertized interest rates until you read all the fine print and look at the high deposit requirements.","***How we formulate the Benchmark Data:","Under the Benchmark tab labeled &#34;Online Banks&#39; Interest Rates,&#34; you will find the basic interest rate paid on a savings account for new customers. This number is not static and will change based on the amount you deposit, your current balance and special promotions the bank might be having. The interest rate we have displayed was obtained by contacting the bank to evaluate the interest rate on a new account with the lowest possible minimum balance.","The second Benchmark tab, &#34;Online Bank Interest Rates Compared to Major Banks,&#34; is a computation of the interest rate found at the online bank, as above, and divided by the average rate of major “brick and mortar” banks. The average interest earnings for these banks is currently calculated as .05%, and was derived by contacting the three major banks (Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Chase), and averaging their interest earnings rate for a similar account.","The Benchmark values found under this tab represent the ratio of each online bank&#39;s interest rate to .05% (the brick and mortar average). The value you see here is a product of that ratio, which is obtained by dividing the estimated interest rate found at online banks (the values in the first tab) by the average interest rate of the brick and mortar banks (.05). The banks that feature a larger Benchmark number than competing banks in our review provide a proportionately higher interest earnings rate on savings. The data used to compute these values is current as of October 2011."]},"id":"5d748d74-028c-43ac-8001-782f56392e38","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53221","url":"/my-banking-direct-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-30T22:44:49Z","datePublished":"2011-06-30T22:44:49Z","name":"My Banking Direct","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"verdict":"We recommend this bank for online checking.","pros":["This online bank has no minimum balance or fees for checking accounts."],"cons":["There is a $100 minimum deposit and monthly balance for savings accounts."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-06-30T22:44:49Z","id":"q2mvAeFxFgPsnMWcCtzLSj","meta":{"title":"My Banking Direct Review - Interest Rates, Service & Security","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
