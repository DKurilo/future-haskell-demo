When closed, the keyboard is located on the back of the phone making it look like your average flip phone.  However, when swung open, the keyboard sits directly beneath the screen. The swinging keyboard may make the user worried about durability of the phone, but the phone is solid and feels up for constant use. The keyboard will type only if it is beneath the display and not if closed and placed in your pocket. Not only does this Motorola device have a unique flip design, it also features a touch pad, called the backtrack, for viewing and selecting menu items."]},"id":"c9b56170-241c-4c5f-8101-00c5db2ac811","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"adc029dc-334b-42c4-a3fd-0d22524aeba9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For such a nontraditional phone design, the camera and video options are fairly basic.

The phone features basic and advanced editing tools, so no matter where you are, you can turn your pictures into high quality.","A standout feature on the Backflip is MOTOBLUR. This software allows you to keep track of contacts by choosing pictures of the individuals from a social network you specify.

MOTOBLUR offers access for photo sharing on MySpace, Photobucket, Picasa and Facebook.
