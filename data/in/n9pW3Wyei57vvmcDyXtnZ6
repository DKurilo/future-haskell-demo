You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</i>","The Planar PX2230MW is an optical <a href=\"/best-touchscreen-monitors\">touchscreen monitor</a> that has HD resolution and multi-touch capabilities. The A-frame stand this monitor uses makes the touchscreen more practical to use for an extended period. Additionally, it has a 170-degree vertical viewing angle, so you can see a great picture even if you have the screen reclined to its maximum amount, which is 20 degrees. The screen would be more practical if it reclined more than 20 degrees.","This touchscreen LCD monitor uses optical sensors to determine where you touch the screen. It also enables you to have multiple touch points. The Planar touchscreen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio. The pixel pitch, or space between the pixels, is 0.248 mm, which is standard for a 21.5-inch screen with this resolution. The Planar PX2230MW has a brightness level of 300 candelas per meter squared, which is one of the highest among the monitors we reviewed. It also has a 1000:1 contrast ratio, which means black and white will be represented accurately on the screen.","A touchscreen monitor is interactive and requires you to use your arms and hands more. If you don&#39;t have a screen that enables you to rest your arms comfortably, you&#39;ll find that a touchscreen isn&#39;t practical. While this screen has an A-frame stand, which is a great for a touchscreen, the screen doesn&#39;t recline beyond 20 degrees. This angle may be too harsh for a comfortable and practical position. The stand is a little harder to adjust then we would have liked, but once you get it in an ideal location, it works perfectly. If you don&#39;t want the stand, you can remove it and mount the touchscreen monitor on a wall. The Planar monitor is the lightest monitor we reviewed, weighing barely more than 12 pounds.","One thing that may be a minor irritation is the bezel that houses the optical sensors. It creates a small lip around the screen that may make it difficult to select objects near the sides. However, you can use a stylus with this monitor, which may make the added edge of the bezel of little consequence."]},"id":"175af4f8-360f-4fff-886f-4daf6b040ea5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6848a4d7-bb9d-4779-a6ac-193614e24f79","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This optical Planar touchscreen doesn&#39;t recline much, but it is set in an A-frame stand so that it will be more ergonomic than some touchscreens.
