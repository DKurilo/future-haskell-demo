It can fry an 18-pound turkey to perfection and can also cook fish, chicken, vegetables or any other food that can be deep fried.","This 30-quart <a href=\"/best-turkey-fryers\">turkey fryer</a> has a 38,000 Btu heat capacity and sits on a stable stand. There are safety brackets you can adjust to make certain the pot stays safely mounted on the base. In addition, it comes with a turkey rack and lifter hook to hoist a big bird in and out of the cooking oil.","Bass Pro Shops doesn’t specify the maximum amount of oil this fryer holds. Instead, a company representative said to put the turkey into the pot, add enough water to properly cook it and then remove it. After that, measure the water to determine how much oil to use.","As a precaution, you should then carefully dry the turkey before attempting to put it into the hot oil. Putting a wet or partially frozen turkey into hot oil is a serious fire hazard.","One of this turkey fryer’s best benefits is it has a spigot to drain the cooled, used oil out of the pot. That makes cleanup far easier and tidier than tipping the pot to pour out the oil. The Bass Pro Shops Stainless Steel Turkey Fryer doesn’t have a vented lid, which would be a nice touch since it would allow steam to escape.","However, it includes helpful extras like a 12-inch deep fry thermometer. The fryer also comes with a marinade injector, which many cooks love since it can heighten the flavor of a fried turkey or other meats.","There is also a handy timer that includes an automatic shut-off that kicks in every 20 minutes. That means you need to reset it often as your turkey cooks. Admittedly, that can be somewhat annoying, but since you are frying in a large amount of hot oil, you need to pay super close attention to what’s going on. You can prepare first-rate fried turkey and other foods with this fryer, but if you prefer took cook your turkey inside, take a look at the <a href=\"/masterbuilt-butterball-xl-review\">Masterbuilt Butterball XL Fryer MB23010618</a>."]},"id":"30daf4a1-dc67-4eaf-a192-ef32b85cf9f7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70248","url":"/bass-pro-shops-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-25T14:51:16Z","datePublished":"2018-09-25T14:51:16Z","name":"Bass Pro Shops","synopsis":"The Bass Pro Shops Stainless Steel Turkey Fryer with Spigot is a durable stainless steel cooker that works outdoors and is fueled by propane.
