Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Zoombak A-GPS Universal tracking device is very similar to its Advanced sibling, with many of the same features, including continuous tracking, safety zones, a long-life battery and more. It doesn’t come with a car installation kit though, and like the Advanced unit, you can’t access tracking history past seven days. Still, it’s a solid <a href=\"/best-gps-trackers\">GPS tracker</a> that you can use to monitor the whereabouts of your teen driver, child or runaway pet.","There are many features found in the Zoombak A-GPS Universal tracking device that are found in the Advanced unit, except of course for the car installation kit. The device is small and light, waterproof, and looks like a pager. With the web-based service you can track where your family or pet is, set up a safety zone they can travel in and opt to receive text or email alerts when the device leaves the zone. You can access the service with any internet-connected Windows PC, Apple Computer or smartphone.","The rechargeable battery can last up to four or five days in standby mode, but if you’re using features like continuous tracking, the battery won’t last as long, about 20 hours. If the battery charge drops to a certain level, you will receive an email or text alert to charge it.","You can access the tracking information, maps and your account at Zoombak’s site. Once you’ve logged in, you can select to receive alerts by email or text message, and you can create up to 10 safety zones, which are essentially geo-fences. You can also set the GPS tracker to continually send position updates, as frequently as every five minutes.","A safety zone is an area you and your child or teen agree that they can travel in, such as specific streets to get to school, a friend’s house and so on. If they leave or enter the zone, you’ll receive an alert notifying you and you can check their current location on Zoombak’s site. You can also set up the device to alert you when they arrive at their destination, and when they depart. You also have access to tracking history logs, so you can see their position based on the time and date, up to seven days.It’s simple to activate and register the Zoombak A-GPS Universal tracking device and then attach it to your child’s backpack or bike or the car your teen is driving in. You’ll need to purchase an installation kit if you want to install it on the dashboard of the vehicle. You can also attach this GPS tracker to your pet’s collar so if it runs away you can easily track your dog or cat.","It’s recommended that you let your child or teen know you’ll be using the device and Zoombak service to keep an eye on them for safety reasons. You should also agree upon the areas they can travel in, especially teen drivers.","The Zoombak A-GPS Universal comes with several help and support options, including a user manual, a quick-start guide, an extensive set of FAQs and troubleshooting tips, and written and video tutorials. If you need more help, you have further questions or you require technical support, you can reach Zoombak by telephone or email."]},"id":"3ad176c2-f54c-4983-98b5-51c6f3da2210","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"542f69e6-8aeb-40d9-aa69-7003d017a176","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Zoombak A-GPS Universal is pretty much identical in features to its Advanced sibling, except it doesn’t come with a car installation kit.
