Each tire is covered by a 6-year warranty with varying tread-life mileage and a 30-day road test. In my review of the prices, options and tread-life warranties, Michelin had average performance options and tread-life warranties, but was hindered by high average prices per tire.","The average price for the most common sedan tire sizes is $132 per tire. This was the highest average price in my review for the sedan tires. By comparison, <a href=\"/cooper-discoverer-a-t3-review\">Cooper</a> costs an average of $73 per tire for the same size and has six performance options. With nearly a $60 difference, it costs about $240 more to replace all your tires, not counting installation or shipping costs. The SUV and truck tire sizes don&#39;t fare much better, averaging $214 and $259 respectively.","The most impressive aspect of Michelin is the 54 tires covered by its tread-life warranty. Only a few brands cover more than 30 tires and most cover less than 25 tires. The reason Michelin is so far ahead is because it provides tread-life warranties on the type of tires not typically covered by other brands. For example, all of the winter tires have tread-life warranties ranging between 25,000 and 40,000 miles. All the all-terrain truck tires have tread-life warranties and even the ultra-high performance sport tires have tread-mile warranties. These are performance tires not often covered by other brands.","The highest tread-life is 90,000 miles, covering the Defender T/H all-season tire, and the average tread-life miles is 45,000 miles, which is below the market average. However, when you consider the winter, all-terrain and sport performance tires, the low average is understandable because these are typically not covered by other brands.","With so many tire series made by this tire brand, Michelin&#39;s performance options are disappointing. After searching for the most common tire sizes fitting passenger vehicles and trucks, it&#39;s surprising how a brand with 56 lines of tires doesn&#39;t provide the most options to fit each tire side. For example, with 15-inch rims, it averaged just two tire options. On 16-inch rims, it averaged a solid eight options, but this is only half what <a href=\"/goodyear-assurance-tripletred-all-season-review\">Goodyear</a> averaged at the same sizes. On 17-inch rims, it averaged six options while Goodyear averaged 13. In addition, the truck tires averaged three options per size to Goodyear&#39;s 11 options on the same size.","<strong>Summary</strong><br/>Michelin is a premium tire brand, as shown with the high prices. While a few brands offer more performance options on common tire sizes, the tread-life warranties are generally very good, especially if you want winter, all-terrain and sport performance tires. You just have to hope they make a tire to fit your rim."]},"id":"74bae9a9-efe2-4e05-b93e-2c119f3e61b3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67969","url":"/michelin-ltx-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-13T17:15:47Z","datePublished":"2016-06-13T17:15:47Z","name":"Michelin","synopsis":"Michelin, a French tire brand founded in 1889, is the second-largest tire manufacturer in the world.
