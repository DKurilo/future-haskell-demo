We awarded top grades to mixers with the smoothest and most resilient dough, and the cleanest bowl since that means everything was properly mixed.","Using the paddle attachment, we made a batch of basic cookie dough in each mixer, then added chocolate chips. Among other things, we noted whether the mixer lets you begin slowly to keep ingredients nicely in the bowl and avoid a flour shower, and whether we could incorporate chocolate chips without grinding them into sprinkles. We gave top marks to mixers that did not expel flour everywhere as we added dry ingredients, incorporated the chips in gently and, most importantly, fully mixed all the ingredients."]},"id":"09b1c763-7f1a-4f1b-bf7d-6c6186a2bcb0","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/SDCGS9ZMMzs6gb4iDKppMS.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/mixers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9NL0kvNzczMjI2L29yaWdpbmFsL1N0YW5kLU1peGVycy1TdW5iZWFtLU1peG1hc3Rlci0wMDIzNzEtMDAwLU5QMC1UZXN0aW5nLTAwNC5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SDCGS9ZMMzs6gb4iDKppMS.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"SDCGS9ZMMzs6gb4iDKppMS","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SDCGS9ZMMzs6gb4iDKppMS.jpg","alt":""},"id":"38540eca-bd78-4e62-8d90-72bebf4689d7","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/>We used the whisk attachment to whip four ounces of room-temperature egg whites to examine each mixer&#39;s ability to volumize egg whites by whipping air into them. The goal was to get stiff peaks. The best mixers created the greatest amount of poufy volume and did this in the time we set, which was four minutes. Again, best marks went to the mixers that performed well in the time set (or in less time, as was the case for the KitchenAid Artisan Tilt-Head Stand Mixer and the Breville Bakery Chef.) We also ranked mixers for the volume of poufy egg whites each produced and whether the egg whites were whipped to the stiff peak stage.","<strong>Keep Your Stand Mixer Sparkling Clean</strong>","If you’re like most people, you no doubt wash your stand mixer attachments, wipe down the outside of the machine and call it a day, at least most of the time. However, from time to time, it’s good to deep clean your mixer to keep it sanitary and make sure it looks great on your countertop.","The user manual for the KitchenAid Artisan, a highly popular stand mixer, describes which parts can go into the dishwasher and gives some general information, but it doesn’t specify how often to thoroughly clean your mixer. In an <a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-clean-a-stand-mixer-229232\">article</a> on Kitchn, Erika Tracy gives some excellent tips for keeping your mixer really clean – no matter what brand it is.","Tracy recommends you unscrew the attachment hub plate – the spot where you secure attachments – and wipe the inside. She also suggests you clean the beater shaft, which is where you insert beaters, since fine ingredients can build up there.","“The rim on the back of the motor head casing collects dust and grime that may go unnoticed. The lipped area underneath the motor head is a prime spot for splatters and food residue, as is the rim of the bowl clamping plate and any exposed screws. Use a Q-tip or small brush to remove grime and residue,” Tracy says. You can turn the machine on its side to thoroughly clean the bottom as well as tip the motor head back and lock it in place to clean the area beneath it.","In case you have a new stainless steel mixing bowl with residue that won’t come off with regular washing, KitchenAid’s <a href=\"https://producthelp.kitchenaid.com/Countertop_Appliances/Stand_Mixers/Stand_Mixer_Cleaning_and_Care/Remove_Residue_from_Stainless_Bowls\">website</a> suggests spreading olive oil inside the bowl, letting it sit for a while, and then washing it with hot water and detergent. You can also scrub the residue off with a mixture of lemon juice and salt or a baking soda and water paste. “By doing so, you are able to remove the residue safely. These are food safe alternatives with abrasive qualities that will adequately clean the bowl,” KitchenAid says."]},"id":"22cc397d-a62a-4473-88e5-1d04b38559cf","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong><br/></strong>"]},"id":"ac11e74a-d97e-4911-826d-a8e9f83cc17c","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>More Appliance Guides for Home Cooks:</strong>"]},"id":"681377e0-2745-4af3-b83e-7000fb44fa97","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-blenders\">The Best Blenders</a>","<a href=\"/best-bread-makers\">The Best Bread Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-deep-fryers\">The Best Deep Fryers</a>","<a href=\"/best-dehydrators\">The Best Dehydrators</a>","<a href=\"/best-donut-makers\">The Best Donut Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">The Best Egg Cookers</a>","<a href=\"/best-fondue-pots\">The Best Fondue Pots</a>","<a href=\"/best-food-processors\">The Best Food Processors</a>","<a href=\"/best-food-scales\">The Best Food Scales</a>","<a href=\"/best-food-steamers\">The Best Food Steamers</a>","<a href=\"/best-ice-cream-makers\">The Best Ice Cream Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-juicers\">The Best Juicers</a>","<a href=\"/best-meat-grinders\">The Best Meat Grinders</a>","<a href=\"/best-meat-slicers\">The Best Meat Slicers</a>","<a href=\"/best-pasta-makers\">The Best Pasta Makers</a>","<a href=\"/best-rice-cookers\">The Best Rice Cookers</a>","<a href=\"/best-slow-cookers\">The Best Slow Cookers</a>","<a href=\"/best-sous-vide-machine-review\">The Best Sous Vide Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-toasters\">The Best Toasters</a>","<a href=\"/best-toaster-ovens\">The Best Toaster Ovens</a>","<a href=\"/best-turkey-fryers\">The Best Turkey Fryers</a>","<a href=\"/best-waffle-makers\">The Best Waffle Makers</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"801b8c2a-f0a6-48d5-ad65-fb051a57d6fc","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"500258f5-fa62-404f-8418-f180cf5f15e0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/kitchenaid-artisan-review\">KitchenAid Artisan KSM150PSGD</a>","<a href=\"/cuisinart-precision-review\">Cuisinart Precision</a>","<a href=\"/kitchenaid-classic-review\">KitchenAid Classic</a>","<a href=\"/oster-stand-mixer-review\">Oster Planetary</a>","<a href=\"/breville-bem825bal-review\">Breville the Bakery Chef</a>","<a href=\"/hamilton-beach-63325-review\">Hamilton Beach</a>","<a href=\"/bosch-compact-mixer-review\">Bosch Compact Mixer</a>","<a href=\"/sunbeam-mixmaster-review\">Sunbeam MixMaster</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"2534c366-b8da-4332-b876-3f13c199328c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_36","url":"/best-mixers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-22T07:26:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-22T07:26:00Z","name":"Best Mixers of 2019","synopsis":"We spent 120 hours testing stand mixers with bread dough, cookie dough and egg whites and ranked 10 popular mixers from best to worst.","review":{},"strapline":"We spent 120 hours testing stand mixers with bread dough, cookie dough and egg whites and ranked 10 popular mixers from best to worst.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-22T17:14:05Z","id":"BZVAqTAHHVUARbA9uoVgMT","meta":{"title":"Best Stand Mixers 2019 -
