It comes with a subwoofer that really enhances its low-end prowess. This sound bar didn’t impress quite enough to reach the top of our lineup, but it has many strengths that make it worth considering.","The bass response was most impressive. The wireless 8-inch subwoofer added the low-end presence that captures sound effects such as explosions in action movies. The low end was focused and well rounded. During our music test, the bass drove the kick drum without overpowering the rest of the music.","This sound bar struggled with surround sound simulation and dialogue clarity. Flat and unclear are the best words to describe the dialogue quality. Other sound bars seemed to be more dynamic than the Sharp in terms of vocal clarity. Its volume levels also weren’t as balanced as those of other sound bars we reviewed. At times, the action scenes were too loud compared to the dialogue.","Many of the 2.1-channel sound bars we tested struggled with surround sound, the Sharp HT-SB602 included. It didn&#39;t provide detailed audio, and most of the sounds seemed to be coming from the middle as opposed to all sides of the room.","You can pair this Bluetooth sound bar with mobile devices to stream audio. It had average Bluetooth range in both our clear-line-of-sight test and when walls were introduced. Standard Bluetooth range is 33 feet, and the Sharp sound bar reached 41 feet before it started to lose signal. When we walked around two adjacent walls, the signal range reduced to 27 feet, which is a little below average Bluetooth range. This second test gives you a more accurate idea of how wide the range will be in your home.","This sound bar includes two HDMI ports so you can connect multiple devices to it to play a high-quality digital signal. There is also an aux port so you can plug mobile devices directly into the sound bar. The unit does not have Wi-Fi capabilities or USB ports."]},"id":"f1d987a1-11ab-4c56-921b-8512f14d17fa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"205bdc43-2467-4b4c-9b4a-9c9548649ee3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sharp HT-SB602 home theater sound bar comes with a wireless 8-inch subwoofer that adds powerful bass presence.
