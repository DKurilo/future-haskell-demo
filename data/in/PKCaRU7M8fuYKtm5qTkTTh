You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Swiffer SweeperVac combines a Swiffer dry-sweeping cloth with a cordless hard floor vacuum. It picks up dirt and debris on a variety of hard-floor surfaces, both sucking up particles and collecting them on the cloth. The bagless cleaner is lightweight and portable, weighing only 3.7 pounds and measuring 45.7 x 7.5 x 7 inches (H x L x W).","The SweeperVac head uses both the Swiffer dry-sweeping cloth and a vacuum with a nine-inch cleaning path. The vacuum sucks up large particles like cereal, crumbs and pet hair. The dry cloth follows the vacuum, collecting smaller particles of dirt and dust. It also picks up particles from grout lines and crevices in hard floor surfaces like tile, hardwood and laminates. The cloths are disposable, and Swiffer recommends replacing the cloth after every use for the best results, so plan on buying replacements regularly.","The dirt and debris collected by the vacuum are stored in a removable dirt cup. The cup is transparent green, making it easy to see when it is full, and it is easy to empty because it’s removed with the press of a button. The standard filter is located inside the dirt cup, and it should be cleaned after each use. It is not washable and should be replaced every six months.","This cordless <a href=\"/best-stick-vacuums\">stick vacuum</a> has a rechargeable 7.2-volt battery, so you can take it anywhere in the house without needing to plan your cleaning around where the outlets are located. When the battery is running low, the power button will turn red, indicating that the vacuum needs to be charged by plugging it into an outlet. The light will turn green when it is fully recharged.","The SweeperVac comes with a limited one-year warranty on parts and labor. The Swiffer website provides customer support information, a downloadable product manual and videos to show you how to get the most out of your sweeper and hard floor vacuum.","The SweeperVac uses both Swiffer dry-sweeping cloths and the cleaning convenience of a stick vacuum. The vacuum sucks up large particles, while the cloth picks up small particles and cleans in grout and crevices. It is a cordless and lightweight vacuum, so it is easy to move around the house, and it is compact for easy storage."]},"id":"cc253212-eb67-4d8c-8c8e-c09a4764693b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58666","url":"/swiffer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-17T20:02:06Z","datePublished":"2014-01-17T20:02:06Z","name":"Swiffer SweeperVac","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
