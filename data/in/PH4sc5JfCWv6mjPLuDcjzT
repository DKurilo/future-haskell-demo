There aren’t as many preset options available for this compact microwave. If you are interested in other products with more features, look at the Haier, Panasonic and Whirlpool compact microwaves.","This countertop microwave oven only includes six presets – fewer than any other product in the lineup. They include:"]},"id":"7a4718c1-a20c-4957-ba64-f18cf39e26c4","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Popcorn","Pizza","Beverage","Potato","Vegetable (Fresh)","Reheat"],"type":"ul"},"id":"8dae2a73-1936-4f03-ad17-e4cbef7ff315","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["These six are the most common presets on compact microwave ovens. Each has multiple serving options. Once you’ve selected the option you want, simply press PAUSE, and the microwave oven will start automatically; you don’t have to press START. The auto defrost setting is divided into three categories: MEAT, POULTRY and STEAKS. Once you have selected which category you want, enter the weight in pounds. The manual provides a conversion chart from ounces to pounds. There is no Time Defrost preset but the manual recommends using power level three.","The multi-stage cooking option is a little different with this model than the others in our lineup. Including an auto defrost stage, you can have a total of four stages, although it doesn&#39;t support multiple defrost stages. The functions for programming multiple cooking stages in this model are similar to those in other compact microwave ovens. Just enter multiple cook times and powers before pressing START.","This compact microwave is only available in black or white. It’s one of the few microwaves that has a button to open the door instead of just pulling a handle. While this isn’t a big thing, it is something you might want to consider while you are looking at the different products. The text on the buttons isn’t as clear from a distance because of how small it is, but there is a good contrast between the text and the background color for both black and white versions.","The manual provided with this countertop microwave has one of the best layouts we’ve seen. It utilizes PDF functionality such as text links and search capabilities. While it doesn’t contain as much information as other compact microwave oven manuals, it includes a lot of tips and tricks for using the product. We didn’t have any problem following the instructions provided or locating the information we were looking for.","The manual includes a table about cooking specific vegetables, fresh or frozen. Since the vegetable preset is limited, the table talks about using the timed cook. It also gives tips on the size of container to use and how much water to add to make sure it doesn’t dry out during the cooking process. Particularly, they discuss preparing vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli, corn on the cob, spinach and squash. We found this information very useful when trying to cook vegetables so they are soft but not mushy.","The service section of the manufacturer’s website included a lot of general information on using microwaves; however, it included little information on this specific model. The site does have multiple email forms for quite a few departments including multiple contact phone numbers if you need to speak to someone regarding a problem you may be having."]},"id":"bae330e9-1135-4943-a44a-484d45801b28","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7e5c8f8c-a234-455e-a8d2-926805ae4485","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GE JE740WK is a useful little compact microwave that has some good information in the manual but doesn’t have as many features as some of the other products."]},"id":"9daaefd3-6f9b-440f-a272-7e824fdc9633","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50728","url":"/ge-microwave-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-09-15T13:42:36Z","datePublished":"2010-09-15T13:42:36Z","name":"GE JE740WK","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
