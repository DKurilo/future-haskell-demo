You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Magellan RoadMate 9616T-LM is a navigation GPS device that comes preloaded with maps of the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. It features an impressive 7-inch color display. Though it lacks some high-end functionality and an intuitive interface, it’s a solid <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">car GPS</a> with decent battery life that can last for up to two hours.","As with the best GPS system, the Rand McNally OverDryve, the RoadMate 9616T-LM has 7 million preloaded points of interest. You can set up multiple destinations within your journey and the device will automatically create the most efficient route. Always on the display is the speed limit indicator so you can see how fast you’re supposed to be going. It also gives you advance notice of upcoming turns and shows you which lane you need to be in to make an upcoming turn. In case of traffic or other delays, it can suggest a quicker route. However, it lacks a voice-activated function, which is both a convenience- and safety-related feature, aimed at keeping your eyes on the road.","Another downside of this GPS system is that it features a resistive touchscreen rather than capacitive. In comparison with resistive screens, capacitive displays allow for a more accurate and responsive touch controls, and they usually have a higher display resolution. However, the 9616T-LM has a fairly high-resolution display, measuring 800 x 480 pixels, which is on par with some higher ranked options in our comparison. And its large 7-inch display is also a rare find for such a low price.","The RoadMate 9616T-LM has a route avoidance feature, which lets you tell the device to avoid things like toll roads and other hassles. You can save your favorite or most commonly visited destinations to the address book, making them easier to navigate to in the future. It boasts Bluetooth connectivity, which allows you to pair your smartphone to the device for an enhanced driving experience. There are also a few extra features, like a parking finder, a headlight reminder for when it becomes dark outside, and a driving break reminder for switching drivers or taking a break.","You can contact Magellan’s customer service team via live chat, email or phone – whichever is most convenient for you. There are also several informational resources available on the manufacturer’s website. The GPS device ships with an industry-standard one-year warranty.","While the Magellan RoadMate 9616T-LM isn’t ideal for the driver who wants every premium convenience, it does offer a few excellent features, like lifetime map updates and better than average battery life. Despite its complex interface and lack of voice-activated navigation, this GPS unit has an abundance of basic features aimed at simplifying your commute – as well as a budget-friendly price."]},"id":"1439b1f5-bfbd-4d50-b188-a7b7a36cc0a0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69729","url":"/magellan-roadmate-9616t-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-02-14T19:20:47Z","datePublished":"2018-02-14T19:20:47Z","name":"Magellan RoadMate 9616T-LM","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":87,"verdict":"The Magellan RoadMate 9616T-LM is a basic GPS without many premium features.
