We looked for a range of cleaning capabilities in the products we examined and made a concerted effort to find shop vacuums that could handle the different kinds of messes you may encounter at home, ranging from drywall dust scattered around on a floor to a flooded basement.","Among other things, we studied manufacturer websites and sought out expert opinions for advice on finding the best product. Paul Mayer is a Minnesota-based woodworker and tool reviewer that you can see in action on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-vLEpyU5lxPI_NaSehA3Sg\">Tool Metrix</a> channel on YouTube. He has owned a lot of shop vacs over the years and now uses a large dust collector more than any shop vac. He still uses a shop vac for anything left after he sweeps up the floors, though. He recommends doing specific research.","&#34;Know what you need to use it for and read reviews, looking for exactly your use case. If someone is happy with it but is using it for a different task, then it won&#39;t necessarily work for what you want,&#34; said Mayer. &#34;Example: It doesn&#39;t matter if it will pick up a bowling ball. If you are wanting it to extract dust from a cabinetmaker&#39;s table saw then you will be disappointed.&#34;","Mayer said his favorite shop vac is super quiet and has a built-in filter cleaning mechanism that works well. Those were common themes in many of the articles and reviews we read – concerns about the filter getting clogged and the extreme volume of some machines.","&#34;Although several manufacturers list the decibel level of their vacuums, how and where the measurement is taken makes a difference, as does the frequency of the sound,&#34; reads part of a <a href=\"http://www.woodworkersjournal.com/shop-vacuum-roundup/\">shop vac review in Woodworker&#39;s Journal</a>.","We purposely designed our tests to allow for measuring the sound on the same machine, in the same room, in the same way for uniform results. We strive for that same uniformity in all our testing.","<strong>How We Tested  </strong>","We spent more than 40 hours running the shop vacuums we chose for testing through a series of trials to see how well each performed. For our tests, we vacuumed up typical materials you&#39;d run into in your own home or garage. We measured 2 ounces of mulch and sawdust mixed with six small screws and spread it on a piece of carpeting. After using each machine to clean up the mess, we then measured how much of the debris the shop vacuums picked up after one pass. We deliberately included bigger pieces of mulch to see how well all the shop vacuums performed when handling heavier items.","To test suction, we measured 2 gallons of water, poured it into a bathtub with the drain stopper in and then vacuumed up the water, taking note of how long it took for each vacuum to complete the task. We found the best vacuums were up to three times faster than those on the lower end of our product lineup. After the vacuuming tests were done, we conducted somewhat subjective testing by examining how clean each filter appeared to be. We also conducted several general movement tests, such as moving the vacuums around by the hose or over an obstacle, to get a sense of how easy it was to maneuver each vacuum.","<strong>How Much Does a Shop Vacuum Cleaner Cost?<br/></strong>","Shop vacs do not vary too widely in terms of price. The most popular ones on Amazon, Home Depot and Lowe&#39;s cost between $40 and $100. The average price of the most popular products on those sites is about $80. We tested a relatively wide range of products, with units costing as much as $170 and as little as $45. The higher priced products did tend to perform better, but not in every case. For example, the <a href=\"/dewalt-review\">DeWalt DCV581H</a> is designed as a portable shop vacuum, but because of this, it lacks the power and capacity of our best-rated shop vacs.","<strong>Design: What Do You Need? </strong>","The best shop vacuums give you lengthy hoses, several different extension tools and power cords that extend up to 20 feet and can be locked in place. It&#39;s also helpful to get a shop vacuum with a big tank, and our top-notch vacuums have tanks as big as 14 gallons. However, you might not need something so large for the jobs you do and the storage space you have. In that case, you can get vacuums with tanks as small as 2 gallons.<br/><strong><br/><strong>Filters: Does a Shop Vac Need a Filter? <br/></strong></strong><br/>This is one of the most common questions people looking to purchase a shop vac have. It really comes down to what you are going to use it for.  If you are using the vacuum for larger objects and not fine particles, you don&#39;t necessarily need a filter. If you often vacuum fine materials like ash or sawdust, you should look for a dust filter that traps tiny particles. Without a filter in place when you vacuum up sawdust or other fine particulates, you&#39;ll most likely just end up blowing the particles out of the shop vac again, which ultimately defeats the purpose of vacuuming!","Shop vacuums come with different filters – some are cloth bags you must replace, others are cartridges you can clean and reuse.  Most models come with a pleated cartridge filter, which is easier to change and less likely to leak than a foam or cloth filter.","<strong>Attachments: What Jobs Do You Need Your Vacuum to Do? </strong>","Attachments can make all the difference in deciding if a particular wet-dry vacuum is right for your needs. Most shop vacuums have extension wands for hard-to-reach areas, but some come with multiple wands for added reach. For cleaning bulky debris, brush nozzles work best, and crevice tools are good for cleaning corners or cracks. For the blower, some vacuums come with a special wide tool for covering a larger area. For wet cleanup, look for squeegees and concentration nozzles. We reiterate Paul Mayer&#39;s advice above and encourage you to evaluate how you&#39;ll primarily use your shop vac, as this is more important than the sale price in the end. ","<strong>More vacuum buying guides:</strong>","<a href=\"/best-robot-vacuums\">Best robot vacuums</a><br/><a href=\"/best-car-vacuum-cleaners\">Best car vacuums</a><br/><a href=\"/best-cheap-vacuums\">Best budget vacuums<br/></a><a href=\"/best-stick-vacuums\">Best stick vacuums</a><br/><a href=\"/best-deep-vacuum-cleaners\">Best heavy-duty vacuums</a><br/><a href=\"/best-handheld-vacuums\">Best handheld vacuums</a><br/><a href=\"/best-stick-vacuums\">Best stick vacuums</a>"]},"id":"e9b00312-5afe-4d96-be7e-883e9a3c0f90","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"fb38d999-73eb-4ef0-8ff5-ea07984f8dc0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/vacmaster-shop-vac-review\">Vacmaster VBV1210</a>","<a href=\"/ridgid-wd1450-review\">Ridgid WD 1450</a>","<a href=\"/craftsman-shop-vac-review\">Craftsman 12004</a>","<a href=\"/stanley-review\">Stanley SL18129</a>","<a href=\"/armorall-shop-vac-review\">ArmorAll AA255</a>","<a href=\"/shop-vac-review\">Shop-Vac 965-06-00</a>","<a href=\"/powersmith-review\">PowerSmith PAVC101</a>","<a href=\"/dewalt-review\">DeWalt DCV581H</a>","<a href=\"/stihl-review\">Stihl SE 61</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"ef56fe43-2494-408c-889a-1aa02dac3b84","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_229","url":"/best-shop-vacuums","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-04T14:44:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-04T14:44:00Z","name":"Best Shop Vacuums of 2019","synopsis":"We vacuumed mulch, sawdust, screws and two gallons of water to see how well each shop vac performed.
