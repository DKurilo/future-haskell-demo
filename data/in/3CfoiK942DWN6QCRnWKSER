It started out as a British-based manufacturer but is now a subsidiary of Gold Peak Group in Hong Kong. Over the last 60 or so years, KEF has grown and expanded into an international manufacturer, providing some of the best loudspeakers on the market. The KEF C7 is the best of its C series floor standing speakers, but the C series is one of its most basic product lines. Despite being one of the least-expensive speakers that we reviewed, we had still hoped for a little more from such a big name.","The issue we have with the KEF C7 is that it stretches the sound a little too much. Budget-friendly floor standing speakers like this one can&#39;t be expected to be the most phenomenal-sounding speakers ever, but they still need to strive for excellence in audio quality. These speakers can be bi-amped to help make up the difference, but if you are a big enough audio person to know how to bi-amp, odds are you will be saving up for a more expensive set of speakers that doesn&#39;t have the same issue.","There is also another way of compensating for the stretch, and that is by integrating a sub woofer into your KEF C7 setup and setting a crossover to relinquish the midrange speakers of the stress that comes with reproducing low frequencies. The midrange can then more accurately focus on a smaller range of frequencies that won&#39;t require nearly as much effort.","The midrange on this floor standing speaker is covered by two 6.5-inch drivers. The tweeter on the KEF C7 is made of aluminum and is only .75 inches in diameter. All other tower speakers we reviewed utilize 1-inch tweeters, which is probably why they can&#39;t quite reach the frequencies that this one can. The downside is that it can&#39;t reproduce the lower frequencies as well.","If you have a good set of midrange drivers to cover that, then it is not a problem. However, the KEF C7 doesn&#39;t have a driver that is dedicated to the midrange at all. The other two drivers in this floor standing speaker have to cover the mid and low ranges, and that is why the audio may sound a little stretched at times. Adding a dedicated midrange speaker to this system would have landed it a much better ranking. Unfortunately, if you want that, you&#39;ll have to pay the extra money for one of KEF&#39;s higher-end speakers."]},"id":"a0797ac2-4000-4322-ac0c-9aa103a4c970","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"23abece0-b423-43eb-8872-68ad6d917061","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The KEF C7 is a great ported system, but comparatively, it falls a little flat because of the need for an additional driver. Beyond that, it is an average entry-level floor standing speaker. It has a very wide range and good output capabilities.

It really is a solid build; it just isn&#39;t good enough to topple some of the competing products in the same price range."]},"id":"f83d5b7b-bc00-4961-b758-1564c9d670e4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54403","url":"/kef-c7-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-02-09T20:34:07Z","datePublished":"2012-02-09T20:34:07Z","name":"KEF C7","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
