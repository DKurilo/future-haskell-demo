This makes them great to use with portable devices such as tablets, MP3 players, smartphones and laptops. While many of these over-ear headphones are geared toward people needing portable headphones, they are still strong enough to use with higher-impedance audio equipment like DJ mixers.","Some of the stereo headphones in the Sennheiser HD series sport a 4-foot long cables, though higher-quality models in the line have longer ones, and a 1/8-inch gold-plated connector. The cable only connects to the left earphone instead of using a standard Y connection, which keeps it from tangling or getting in the way. The headphones in the HD series are very lightweight, with some weighing only 6.9 ounces. They also don’t grip your head with a vise-like hold, so you can wear the headset comfortably for hours.","Headphones in the HD series are closed-ear headsets, and they are constructed of plastic with no visible metal. There is padding on the headband, and the earpads are soft leatherette cushions. While the closed-ear design blocks some ambient noise, the headphones don’t have additional noise-canceling feature. The earpads are also somewhat narrow, so if you have larger ears you may find them a little uncomfortable.","These headsets do not fold, which makes them a little inconvenient to store or transport. The cable is also not detachable. The included carrying pouch is large, but it does not offer much in the way of protection, so you need to be careful when storing your HD headphones in bags or suitcases. A 1/8- to 1/4-inch adapter is included so you can connect to DJ or stereo jacks – it is rare for stereo headphones to come with this adapter, so this is an added bonus. Also, the soft leatherette earpad cushions are replaceable and not too expensive.","Sennheiser offers comprehensive support for all its products. You can access product FAQs or online manuals to find answers to your questions or submit a technical support ticket through email. If you prefer to talk to someone directly, the company has a toll-free telephone number. The HD series headphones have a two-year limited warranty that covers manufacturing defects but not user-inflicted damage.","Stereo headphones in the Sennheiser HD series are comfortable and sound great. Although they don’t have noise-canceling features beyond their closed-ear design, they are lightweight and comfortable to use for extended listening sessions. Additionally, their accurate sound reproduction makes these headphones a great choice for any music lover or audiophile."]},"id":"4b2f1d3e-dd68-480f-9edf-edef67e83cd8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55794","url":"/sennheiser-hd-449-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-02-15T20:10:59Z","datePublished":"2013-02-15T20:10:59Z","name":"Sennheiser HD Series","synopsis":"Sennheiser HD series stereo headphones use low-impedance transducers to deliver high-quality sound without needing an additional amplifier.
