This guide has been designed to help you protect yourself against ID fraud and stay safe across all areas of your digital life, from social media and web browsing, to online banking and data transfers.","And, simply put, ID theft and identity fraud is something you are right to be concerned about. In the US alone in 2017 it is estimated that over 16 million people suffered from some form of ID theft, with a variety of scams and cons, as well as severe digital vulnerabilities on the victim’s part, allowing cyber criminals to assume a fake identity and then extract money from a bank account, take out huge loans in someone’s name, and make various illegal purchases, too.","If you just want one recommendation of service to go out and sign up for right now then we consider the overall best identity theft protection service to be <a href=\"/identity-force-review\">IdentityForce</a>. This ID fraud prevention system is comprehensive, going well beyond the standard bank account and credit card monitoring of lesser services, and it does so at an affordable monthly cost, too.","<strong>How much does the best identity theft protection cost?</strong>","Typically, you can expect to pay between $10 and $30 a month for an identity theft protection subscription. Basic plans range from about $10 to $20 and usually monitor your bank accounts and credit reports for fraudulent activities. The more expensive plans include dark web searches, three bureau credit reports, notifications about activity on your investment accounts and alerts about crimes carried out in your name."]},"id":"670d52bc-46cf-4fd7-8489-67207949d727","type":"text"},{"data":{"image":{"height":0,"copyright":"","width":0,"caption":"","role":"hero","mimeType":"","name":"IdentityForce.jpg","credit":"","source":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/F/B/827399/original/IdentityForce.jpg","id":"88GyJ5xJ8AhMMThq57HZ3Y","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88GyJ5xJ8AhMMThq57HZ3Y.jpg","alt":""},"layout":"hero","hawk":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"price","data-model-name":"IdentityForce"}},"linkText":"View Site","url":"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=933604&u=113582&m=37815&urllink=&afftrack=IdentityTheft","urlStyle":"button","name":"IdentityForce","review":{"rating":0},"strapline":"For complete identity protection that goes beyond the usual bank accounts and credit cards at a reasonable price, IdentityForce is the best option.","id":"","noFollow":false,"promoLabel":"Best Overall"},"id":"4462f5ef-f84b-4a46-a9f0-83091b955596","type":"featured-product"},{"data":{"image":{"height":0,"copyright":"","width":0,"caption":"","role":"hero","mimeType":"","name":"LifeLock.jpg","credit":"","source":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/F/E/827402/original/LifeLock.jpg","id":"g9AjJ7R2UwhdCEbEU5YvYT","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g9AjJ7R2UwhdCEbEU5YvYT.jpg","alt":""},"layout":"hero","hawk":{"attributes":{"data-widget-type":"price","data-model-name":"LifeLock"}},"linkText":"View Site","url":"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-3112058-12654513","urlStyle":"button","name":"LifeLock","review":{"rating":0},"strapline":"LifeLock’s identity protection extends beyond bank accounts, credit cards, phone numbers and email addresses.

These ID theft stopping tools not only help you spot and detect scams, as well as live monitoring of things like searches about your financial situation, changes of your address, and accounts being opened in your name, but also offer access to top-level credit reports.","These advanced digital security tools also often come with a suite of anti-phishing and anti-keylogger programs, which help keep malware off your system and, as a result, stop hackers from extracting data from you. Many also offer media identity monitoring suites, too, which scan Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Google+ for imposter accounts or malicious, prying links.","Importantly, if anything about you or your accounts is detected, then the best identity theft protection services then introduce a certified identity theft ricks management specialist to handle your case until it is resolved.","Of course, not all this advanced technology comes free and not every identity theft protection service is born equal, with free services offering the most basic features and protection, and then fully paid for services offering secret service-levels of digital security and monitoring. Here, in our best identity theft protection guide, we recommend six paid-for services that we consider the absolute best currently in business.<br/><strong><br/>Why trust us?</strong>","We’ve been reviewing identity theft protection for eight years. In that time we’ve watched the industry and monitored trends to ensure that our reviews reflect the most current services. As the technology of identity thieves becomes more sophisticated, the tools used by these services are advancing in stride.","Services such as <a href=\"/identity-guard-review\">Identity Guard</a> and <a href=\"/lifelock-review\">LifeLock</a> use algorithms and machine learning to search through the dark corners of the internet to see if your information is being sold or used by ID thieves. In addition to monitoring your Social Security number, address and name, these sites also look at medical records, which are increasingly a source of identity fraud.","<strong>How we tested</strong>","We spent 60 hours researching identity theft protection services before narrowing our list down to the best companies. We couldn’t test them in a real-world scenario since that would involve actually getting our reviewer’s identity stolen. Instead, we found comparable plans and contrasted the features each one offered.","One of the most important things to look for is how quickly the service will notify you about potential fraud and the methods used to notify you. The best identity protection services will call or text you. Many services also have mobile apps that notify you about potential fraud. These will let you say whether a transaction or loan application is approved and, if not, begin the process of rectifying the fraud. You’ll also want a service that notifies credit bureaus about fraud, this will save you from contacting the bureaus yourself.","As an added bonus, identity theft protection services often include an element of credit monitoring. Because your credit score can be affected by fraud, you’ll be given access to three-bureau credit reports more frequently than the once a year mandated by federal law. Many services also let you monitor one of your scores monthly.","In the event that your identity is compromised, these services offer recovery services. Look for services that include restoration services, which means you’ll be connected with a specialist who will fill out paperwork and make the necessary calls to help recover your identity.","<strong>Are identity protection services safe?</strong>","Because data breaches are becoming more common, it’s a reasonable question to ask if these identity protection services are themselves safe. Look for an identity theft protection service that uses two-factor authentication (2FA). With 2FA, anyone who gets your email and password through another data breach or a phishing attack is blocked from logging in. Generally, someone gaining access to your ID protection account won’t result in your personal information being compromised, depending on how the service manages that data. But it can result in notifications being deactivated. According to <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/id-protection-services-fail-basic-security,news-26606.html\">Tom’s Guide</a>, many prominent identity protection services don’t offer 2FA, but many are working to add it.","<strong>Government shutdown affects ID theft victims</strong>","As the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/shutdown-blocks-help-identity-theft-victims-ftc-goes-dark-n957721\">U.S. government shutdown</a> passes the 20-day mark, some agencies that provide important services are still unavailable. One of these is the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/ftc-is-closed\">FTC</a>, which aids victims of identity theft. While the government is closed indefinitely, victims of identity theft are unable to report their thefts, and resources the FTC provides to law enforcement are also unavailable.","Typically, in the event of ID theft or other breach of your personal information, you would file a report with the FTC’s <a href=\"https://www.identitytheft.gov/\">identity theft site</a> to begin the process of notifying local law enforcement and to start a recovery plan. The FTC doesn’t intervene on your behalf, but it does provide useful tools and resources to assist you in recovering your identity. With the government shutdown, these are unavailable.","If you are the victim of identity theft during the government shutdown, there are steps you can take to minimize the damage. Get copies of your credit reports and examine them for unusual activity. Also, place freezes on your credit files to prevent new accounts from being opened without your approval. If you are a victim of fraud while the shutdown persists, keep a list of all your calls and correspondences so you can file a complete report when the FTC reopens.","The <a href=\"https://www.idtheftcenter.org/itrc-is-here-to-help-during-the-government-shutdown/\">Identity Theft Resource Center</a>, a nonprofit that provides research and tools to help victims of identity theft, is unaffected by the shutdown.

Information from the guest reservation database was compromised, with potential unauthorized access dating as far back as 2014. The information exposed may include personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and passport numbers. According to Marriott, credit card information was accessible but encrypted, though the company can’t rule out the possibility of that information being decrypted.","Marriott is offering anyone who may have been affected one year of free service from WebWatcher, which monitors the internet for signs that your personal information has been used. Know that the service only detects signs that your data has been compromised – it can’t detect any fraud that occurs.","With so many high-level data breaches, it&#39;s a good practice to have freezes and fraud alerts placed on your credit reports. This greatly reduces the likelihood of someone opening new accounts in your name, though it doesn’t help if your information has already been used fraudulently. Monitor your credit card and bank statements for any purchases you didn’t make and keep an eye on your mail for anything out of the ordinary.","<strong> Google Plus vulnerability forces company to discontinue service</strong>","Google recently discovered several vulnerabilities in its little-used social media platform Google Plus, which left personal identifying information accessible.

Google plans to shut down the Google Plus API in a month.","Google <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/\">plans</a> to notify anyone potentially affected by these vulnerabilities. If you receive a notification, there’s not much for you to do besides transition away from using the service.","<strong>What to do if your identity is stolen</strong>","The sad fact is that your identity has a home in many places you can&#39;t personally safeguard. Things beyond your control, such as the 2017 Equifax hack, leave your information vulnerable. If your identity is stolen, don’t panic. There are several things you can do that will minimize damage.","It’s likely the entity that was compromised will offer you free credit monitoring. While useful, the services offered are usually bare-bones and can take as long as 60 days to notify you of any fraud. The identity theft protection services we reviewed are stronger, quicker and more comprehensive. So if you’re already signed up for an ID theft protection service, the free service offered won’t be of much use to you.","One thing you can do yourself is put a freeze on your credit file. We recommend doing this as soon as you learn of a security breach. A freeze prevents creditors from pulling your credit without your explicit permission. ","<strong>Should I freeze my credit report?</strong>","If you’re worried your personal information is compromised, freezing your credit report is an easy and free security measure worth considering. Also referred to as a security freeze, you can contact <a href=\"https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/\">Equifax</a>, <a href=\"https://www.experian.com/help/\">Experian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.transunion.com/credit-help\">Transunion</a> to freeze your credit report. Doing this restricts access to your credit report, which creditors use to approve loans, credit cards and lines of credit and determines interest rates and repayment terms. So, if the identity thief tries to apply for a loan from a bank, it’s rejected early in the application process because the bank cannot access your report, which protects your credit from unwanted debt placed in your name.","The <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs\">FTC</a> notes that a credit freeze doesn’t prevent identity thieves from making charges to your existing credit cards. So if your credit card or bank account is already compromised, you still need to contact your bank to freeze those accounts until new cards are issued. That said, you can still access and monitor your credit report when it’s frozen, and you can easily have the freeze lifted if you’re applying for a loan, an apartment or job, as the credit agencies are required to lift it within an hour after a request.","Freezing and unfreezing your credit report is free and there are no limits to how often you can do it. It doesn’t stop existing creditors or debt collectors from accessing your credit report, nor does it stop any government agencies who request access in response to court orders, but it’s one of the best options you have for minimizing your risk of identity theft.","<strong>Does where you live make you more vulnerable to identity theft?</strong>","Data breaches seem to be an everyday occurrence these days. The <a href=\"https://www.idtheftcenter.org/data-breaches/\">Identity Theft Resource Center</a> estimates that since 2005 there have been more than 9,000 breaches, exposing more than 1 billion records.
