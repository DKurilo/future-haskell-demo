The software records sales transactions and includes tools for recording customer orders, managing inventory and running sales reports. The hardware for a countertop POS station usually includes a tablet and stand, a cash drawer, and a receipt printer. Many restaurants also connect to a kitchen printer, and you can add peripheral equipment such as a barcode scanner.","Restaurant POS systems differ from retail <a href=\"/best-pos-systems\">POS systems</a> in that they include special feature sets for menus, food inventory and tips. Although some retail POS systems are suitable for counter-service restaurants, most full-service restaurants and bars require a system with restaurant-specific capabilities.","<strong>Why Is Choosing a Restaurant POS System Challenging?</strong>","Each restaurant POS company offers a different combination of software and hardware, and some offer <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/business/payment-processing/best-credit-card-processing/\">payment processing services</a> as well. As you compare services, you want to consider the pricing for all three components to ensure you get the best value.","Most restaurant POS software applications have multiple plans or service tiers to choose from, each with a different feature set and price. Some systems may include all the features you need, while others may require you to choose a higher service tier or add modules or third-party integrations to get the specific features you need. Likewise, on the hardware side, some companies may offer bundles that include everything you need, while others allow you to use just a tablet and add peripherals such as receipt printers and cash drawers as needed to complete your setup. You want to include the costs for these factors as you calculate pricing for the systems you&#39;re considering.","<strong>Our Methodology</strong>","With this year&#39;s update, we added a section to our comparison chart that looks at costs and contracts, as we recognize this is key information for comparing systems. Because our research indicates that most restaurant owners want tablet-based systems, the majority of the companies we considered offer this type of system.","Our evaluation began with a list of 23 restaurant POS systems. We scoured websites for information about each system. Where available, we looked through user manuals, watched video tutorials and asked questions over live chat. We removed from our list companies that don&#39;t serve restaurants in the U.S., as well as those that don&#39;t work with small businesses, bringing our list to 17. The restaurant POS systems that performed best in our testing are presented here as our top 10 picks.","We evaluated each restaurant POS system using the following criteria."]},"id":"20e4681e-dd2e-41cb-8d3d-ba1f8059bcab","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Pricing transparency:</strong> Being able to see the pricing on a company&#39;s website saves you time, as you can determine whether or not a POS system is within your budget before you spend a half hour or more on the phone with a sales agent.","<strong>Monthly subscription fees:</strong> We looked at how much the POS software costs each month for a single terminal. Although your costs may differ from those we were quoted due to the specific needs of your restaurant (such as number of terminals, devices, users, and feature modules or integrations), this number gives you a ballpark estimate of the monthly fee you can expect to pay per register each month. Monthly subscription fees vary widely because each service offers different features, numbers of users and device licenses. Some companies have a comprehensive feature set but may charge extra for each user or device you add to the system. Others have a low base rate and charge per module, which may save you money if you don&#39;t require an extensive feature set and want to pay only for those you select.","<strong>Contractual terms:</strong> Month-to-month or pay-as-you-go contracts give you the freedom to move on if the POS system isn&#39;t meeting your needs or you find a better deal elsewhere. This is particularly important for restaurants that are new or on a tight budget, as some contracts have lengthy terms and early cancellation clauses that charge hefty fees if you close your account before the end of the term. Others contracts, particularly those from companies offering free equipment, are noncancelable, which means that even if your business closes, you&#39;re still responsible to pay on it until your contact expires and you submit written notice to cancel your account before it automatically renews.","<strong>Processing options:</strong> Most of the companies that made it onto our list of the top 10 restaurant POS systems allow you to choose between multiple payment processors, which may save you money, since it allows you to shop around for the most competitive pricing. Some are compatible with several different processors, and others are compatible with nearly every U.S.-based processor. Some systems integrate directly with the payment processing service, while others are used alongside it.","<strong>Hardware requirements:</strong> We looked at whether you&#39;re required to purchase or lease hardware from the POS vendor, or if the system gives you the flexibility of using equipment you already own or purchase from a third-party vendor, as this may save you money.","<strong>Feature availability:</strong> Most restaurant POS systems have an exhaustive list of features. For our comparison chart, we limited the features we looked for to those with the most variance between systems. We omitted <a href=\"/money/small-business\">employee management</a>, <a href=\"/money/small-business\">marketing</a> and <a href=\"/money/small-business\">social media</a> features because, although a few systems include these feature sets, many are added to the systems as third-party integrations.","<strong>Support availability:</strong> All restaurant POS systems offer customer support via email and phone, though availability may vary by hours or the plan tier you subscribe to. We looked at whether a POS company can remotely connect to your account to help you resolve issues, which can make it faster to fix software-based problems. We also considered whether on-site assistance is available for installation and training, which may be a necessity for restaurants that have multiple registers and several employees using the system."],"type":"ul"},"id":"e9a45712-1631-4e2d-a9a0-02ec0667db8b","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Restaurant POS Hardware Considerations</strong>","The POS industry is moving to cloud-based tablet systems, as they&#39;re less expensive, take up less counter space and allow greater customization. Additionally, most allow you to place orders and accept payments tableside. If your restaurant is new or you&#39;ve got a tight budget, a restaurant POS setup can be extremely simple with just a tablet, a card reader or terminal, a cash drawer, and a receipt printer. In most cases, you supply the tablet, your payment processing company sells you the card reader or terminal, and you purchase the cash drawer and receipt printer either directly from the POS company or from a business that sells third-party POS hardware. You can often choose between purchasing equipment in a bundle or piece by piece.","Most systems allow you to add peripherals such as tablet stands, barcode scanners, kitchen printers, scales and liquor controls. More advanced system configurations can include additional tablets or monitors for kitchen displays, customer displays, and self-serve kiosks that allow your customers to place their own orders.

If you want to keep it, you either have to renew the contract and keep paying monthly leasing fees or pay even more money to buy out the equipment.
