You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Broan 413004 Non-Ducted Hood offers a midrange option for homeowners who are also looking for a little modern style. This is a ductless <a href=\"/best-range-hoods\">range hood</a>, so it&#39;s suited for apartment or condo dwellers who are looking for a cost-effective under-cabinet option. It also may be an option for homeowners who simply don&#39;t wish to spend the extra time and expense venting the stove.","The replaceable carbon filters should remove most airborne smells and smoke from the air while you cook. It has a stainless steel finish and rounded corners for safety and style. The two-range fan offers high and low settings to keep the air circulating as effectively as possible. It measures 30 inches wide, 17 inches deep and 6 inches high. These are standard dimensions for an under-cabinet hood.","The light housing holds a 75-watt bulb and includes a protective lens that distributes light evenly across the cooking area. Note that the bulb is not included. The fan and light are both controlled with simple rocker-type switches. A single filter is included with purchase.","In terms of function and features, this model is as simple as an under-cabinet range hood can get. However, the 75-watt bulb should still offer plenty of light and even more than similar models that can only accommodate 30-watt bulbs. There are hoods that have stronger fans, even in the ductless category, but you may also pay quite a bit more for that feature. If you do a lot of cooking and know that you will encounter a lot of unpleasant odors and don&#39;t have the option to install a ducted hood, you may want to consider buying a model with more fan power. Note that a CFM rating is not available, since it is a ductless hood.","Broan provides a one-year warranty for additional security. The fan and light run on a meager 2 amps, so while it is not Energy Star rated, this range hood certainly operates efficiently. However, if you are not directly wiring the hood into the stove, you may need to purchase a separate outlet cord.","The Broan 413004 is a cost-effective appliance from a well-known brand. This is a simple range hood to install underneath your cabinets that will last for years."]},"id":"fb3fc8dd-7ef4-42f9-a3d2-a744020ddc83","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66577","url":"/broan-4100-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-14T21:17:00Z","datePublished":"2015-08-14T21:17:00Z","name":"Broan 413004","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-14T21:17:00Z","id":"L7QooJQRhEwoe3f6bofTiS","meta":{"title":"Broan 413004 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Broan 413004 Non-Ducted Range Hood is ventless with a touch of style.
