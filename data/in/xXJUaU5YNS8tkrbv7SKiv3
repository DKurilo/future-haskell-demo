Unlike concentric searchcoils that have a cone-shaped search field, this DD coil is wedge-shaped and therefore has a larger search field deeper beneath the surface. Just like the <a href=\"/teknetics-delta-4000-review\">Teknetics Delta 4000</a> this metal detector has eight levels of sensitivity, and we found we had to turn it up nearly all the way to pick up almost anything, no matter how shallow the object was buried. This wasn’t the case with most of the metal detectors in our lineup, which we were able to leave at the factory-preset sensitivity level.","In our tests the Ace 400 picked up 39 percent of the objects we buried, the third-lowest pickup rate of the metal detectors we tested. It did, however, accurately identify every object it detected and only the <a href=\"/bounty-hunter-review\">Bounty Hunter Quick Draw Pro</a> came close to doing that. This metal detector also shows you what kind of object you might have found, whether It’s a gold ring or various silver coins. That way, you don’t have to memorize the meaning behind target ID numbers, which also display on the Ace 400’s screen. Notching and discrimination are also an option if you want to look for only certain kinds of metal, or there are preset modes to choose from already programmed into the machine.","Depth is displayed on the screen using notches, accompanied by a helpful key: one notch means a target is 2 inches underground, two notches means it’s 4 inches underground, three notches means it’s 6 inches away and four notches means it is 8 inches deep or more. You should note targets larger than a coin may display shallower than they actually are, but we didn’t notice that when we tested with a piece of aluminum as big around as a soda can. In our tests though, this metal detector only got the depth correct 14 percent of the time, the same as the <a href=\"/winbest-review\">Winbest Master-200</a>.","At 2.9 pounds, this metal detector is the heaviest one we tested. This is counteracted by a fabric strap included with the metal detector; you simply slide it through the slits on the plastic forearm rest and use the Velcro to circle it around your arm. The strap helps keep the metal detector securely against your arm and decreases arm fatigue while you’re using the machine.","Assembly on this one is a little labor intensive because you need a screwdriver, but it comes with freebies like the four AA batteries required to use it and a weather guard for the LCD screen. It also comes with a neat commemorative coin honoring the company’s founder. You can get anywhere between 20 and 40 hours out of the machine before having to change the batteries. It also has a two-year warranty but lacks any volume control."]},"id":"37fa763e-5dc0-414d-94bf-4ce85e737198","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54414","url":"/garrett-ace-metal-detector-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-02-13T14:22:16Z","datePublished":"2012-02-13T14:22:16Z","name":"Garrett Ace 400","synopsis":"This metal detector has an 11-inch DD searchcoil.
