Any email client can double as contact management software, but what you really need is customer relationship management software, also known as CRM software. These powerful programs do more than just store your contacts. They&#39;re more complex than contact management software, but they&#39;re as easy to use as the contact list in your iPhone. Among the products we found to be the best are <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/salesforce-crm-software/\">Salesforce</a>, <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/netsuite/\">NetSuite CRM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/maximizer-crm/\">Maximizer CRM</a>.","As a Mac user, you know there are a lot of great programs out there that you can&#39;t use because they&#39;re developed for PCs only. However, there are several CRM solutions designed exclusively for Mac laptops and computers, such as Daylite and Studiometry. Additionally, with the influx of software as a service (SaaS) and cloud-based applications, there&#39;s more variety for Mac users.","We evaluated several CRM programs for Macs and found software that offers plentiful features, the best functions, and all-in-one solutions for you if you need project-management and employee-tracking features.","<strong>The Best Overall CRM Software</strong>","When you need software that does it all, you want the original CRM software – <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/salesforce-crm-software/\">Salesforce</a>. No other CRM software in our lineup includes more tools and functions than Salesforce.","The interface will feel immediately familiar for Mac users. You have access to tools for sales and marketing, product inventory, employee performance tracking, workflow automation, project management, and contact management, of course, eliminating the need for additional software solutions and bringing more transparency into your company.","<strong>Self-Hosted CRM Solutions for Mac Users</strong>","If you prefer to avoid cloud-based software because of security concerns or because you don&#39;t want to pay a monthly fee, there are a few traditional software solutions.","<a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/daylite/\">Daylite</a> offers many of the same tools you find in SaaS solutions, including workflow automation and case management. However, storage space is limited to what your server can handle, and it&#39;s missing some accounting functions, so you&#39;ll likely need separate software solutions to handle some tasks.","Another option is <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/studiometry/\">Studiometry</a>. It works better as simple contact management software for Macs, so you&#39;re missing helpful features, such as strategy forecasting and competitor comparison. It&#39;s also lacking strong customer support; you can only contact customer service by submitting a ticket from the developer&#39;s website.","<strong>The Most Affordable CRM System</strong>","Small businesses must stick to their budgets, but as a business owner, you need software to help you succeed in your industry. Although Studiometry got its start as traditional licensed software, it also offers a cloud solution for CRM. It costs $18 per month, per user, and you can get it for less if you pay for the whole year in advance.","It is limited, though, so if you want a more robust CRM system, check out <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/sugarcrm/\">SugarCRM</a> or Zoho CRM. Both cost $40 per user/per month, and they include almost every feature that our top-rated CRM software for Macs have.","<strong>A CRM System with Extreme Customization</strong>","Pipedrive rounds out our lineup, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not an excellent CRM program. The best aspect of this system is that where it&#39;s lacking in features, it makes up for in customization and integrations.","You can add fields to almost any section or module, and if there&#39;s something missing, such as an email campaign creator, you can use a program like MailChimp, which integrates with Pipedrive.","Most CRM software offers an open API, too, which means your programmers can craft their own modules to work with the software to meet your needs."]},"id":"618e73ff-f14e-4e04-a0cf-f65ca511d278","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"What We Tested, What We Found"},"id":"b07c05be-a4c2-4df3-badc-ab433c7fdadd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Of the dozens of CRM software we tested, only the best made it onto our top 10 list. While testing these systems on our Mac computers and devices, we assessed how well each program was designed and laid out. We noted where function links and tabs were located and how clearly they were marked. Those programs that required us to click through multiple links to complete common functions received a lower score than those applications with quick, streamlined processes.","We also assessed how intuitive the software was to set up and launch without needing to consult the user guide or contact customer support. Most applications were uncomplicated because they&#39;re web-based, so it was as simple as logging into our accounts.","Some programs include helps embedded within the system that give you quick guidance, which we found helpful and which reflected positively on the software in the rankings. The CRM solutions that scored higher also offer uncluttered interfaces so you can easily find the function, module or tab you need. The less clutter, the better.","During our testing of each application, we spoke with professionals from several industries to learn which tools they specifically need in a CRM solution, then we looked for these features while evaluating each program. Some of these included sharing in real time, which allows multiple users to access, edit and add notes in a client&#39;s account simultaneously.","When we considered the price of the software, we kept small- and medium-sized businesses in mind, but the CRM programs on our list work well for a company of any size. Prices for CRM software fluctuate. We update the pricing each year when we reevaluate Mac CRM software. However, the price you&#39;re quoted may be higher or lower. Also, the prices we listed don&#39;t reflect discounts or promotions.","<strong>What You Can Expect From Mac CRM Programs</strong>","Regardless of which CRM software you choose for your Mac users, they all include the same basic features. Email integration is a given because at its heart, CRM software is contact management software.","Importing and exporting data is another basic requirement because you&#39;re handling long lists of contacts that need to be moved from program to program. Contact timelines are included, so you can quickly see how often a client has been in contact with one of your employees.","Document management capabilities, which let you upload and save important files in the client portals, are vital for several industries, including medical, legal, finance, real estate and insurance. All of these programs let you manage those files easily, or they allow you to integrate with apps like Google Docs.","Sales teams collaborate on a variety of tasks, such as marketing strategies and combined efforts to land a sale. All of the CRM programs in our lineup allow for sales collaboration. Finally, reports are critical so can analyze your sales, email campaigns and invoices.","<strong>The Benefits of Mac CRM Software</strong>","<strong>Less Confusion &amp; Conflicts</strong><br/>You&#39;re likely getting most of your leads from your website or from lists of email addresses. If every member of your sales team handles their own contacts, it can get hairy – especially when more than one person makes a connection with the same lead. Customer relationship software is intended to reduce those instances of head-butting, and, instead, increase efficiency and sales.","<strong>Better-Organized Contacts</strong><br/>Once you enter a current or potential client&#39;s information into a CRM system, it&#39;s updated across the board so all employees see the data. As a sales manager, you can assign particular leads to a sales executive, so there&#39;s no crossover. Additionally, there&#39;s no need for employees to call, email or drop by a colleague&#39;s desk for contact information or update the system&#39;s notes on how well a phone call went.","<strong>Other Functions CRM Performs</strong><br/>The best CRM software does more than organize contacts, it gives you additional tools to make it easier for you to do your job, whether you&#39;re on a sales team, in the warehouse, in customer support, tech support or you&#39;re overseeing the whole company.","A good CRM solution is a combination of contact, project and product management and data analysis. Many CRM solutions include accounting features, too, so you can send invoices to clients or track vendor information.","Plus, many systems let you track employee performance, which is helpful when you need to complete performance reviews. It also lets you analyze marketing campaigns and predict the success of those campaign efforts with the system&#39;s forecasting tools.","<strong>Paying for Mac Software: Cloud vs. On-Premises Solutions</strong>","If it&#39;s important to you to buy a software license, then you only have a handful of options. You&#39;ll likely pay more upfront – the lowest-priced application starts at about $200 per user – but you won&#39;t be stuck with monthly payments.","The convenience of using a cloud-based CRM solution, though, may outweigh the burden of monthly fees. You can get the platform for an unlimited number of users at a fraction of the cost of actual licenses. Also, you don&#39;t have to pay for any upgrades, and there&#39;s no software to install. You might even save money if you pay for a full year of subscriptions – many CRM software companies offer discounts.","<strong>Eliminate the Guesswork with Top Ten Reviews&#39; CRM Comparison Tool</strong>","The best way to choose a CRM solution that works best for you and your fellow Mac users is to make sure you know what you need it for. Some CRM software is better for those who run online stores, while others are excellent choices for real estate agents.","A great place to start is by answering the questionnaire at the top of this page. Your answers will result in a perfect pairing between your company and a CRM solution. A contact management software provider will contact you to discuss your business&#39;s needs.","<strong>Our Verdict &amp; Recommendations</strong>","Customer relationship management software should make contact management via your Mac easier than ever, but it should also go above and beyond. The software you choose to keep your contacts organized and your sales on target should also help you with automatic reminders, workflow automation and project management.","Salesforce is an obvious choice when you want a CRM solution that does almost everything you could need. Its native features and integrations help you stay on top of customer relationship management and they streamline other processes integral to your business. However, it is one of the pricier programs. There are other CRM options that are easier on your bottom line.","One of the more affordable CRM programs that also offers nearly every feature as the top-rated software in our review is Maximizer CRM. It has fewer product-management features, and it limits your storage space, but it&#39;s an excellent choice in every other category.","You won&#39;t have to compromise much with NetSuite CRM. It&#39;s lacking a built-in chat program, but it offers several integrated modules to help you create a suite of programs in one solution.","If you have an office of PC and Mac users, don&#39;t fret. All of the CRM software we reviewed works for both platforms because they&#39;re cloud-based. You and your employees can access the CRM from a web browser or mobile device – and most of the programs include a mobile app, which makes the interface even easier to navigate than just a browser on a smartphone.","Whichever CRM software you decide on, you&#39;re likely to be happy with how easy it is to use, and how much time and effort you&#39;ll save with your business.
