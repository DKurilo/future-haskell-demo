As such, it’s a minimal program that doesn’t offer many tools beyond making rote copies of DVD movies. It has few customization tools and has no option to compress commercial discs to fit onto smaller-capacity, less-expensive blank DVDs.","This program has three DVD copy modes: Full Movie, Main Movie and Custom Mode. Full movie allows you to make an exact 1:1 copy. However, if you are copying a mainstream commercial disc, you must use the larger-capacity dual-layered blank DVDs (DVD-9). This program will not compress DVD content to fit onto a smaller-capacity disc (DVD-5).","The Main Movie copy mode strips away everything except the feature presentation. This is also an exact copy, identical to the original. If your movie is small enough to fit onto a DVD-5, you’ll be able to use one of those discs; otherwise, you’ll have to use a blank DVD-9.","Custom Mode is where you’ll find the ability to pick and choose what DVD content you want to copy onto a new disc. This allows you to split up the contents of a commercial disc onto two or more DVD-5s. This is useful, but the best DVD copy software offers an option to do this automatically.","It takes this program about an hour to copy a DVD onto a new disc. This is about the average speed of the products on our lineup. This program also has the ability to save the ISO file of a disc to the hard drive of your computer. This file is the blueprint of your DVD, and it allows you to burn a new copy without the need of the original disc, which is great if you want a digital backup of your DVD library.","What weighs this program down when compared to the rest of the products on our side-by-side comparison chart is the lack of certain tools found in the best DVD copy software. With this program, you cannot burn a new copy of a disc using the ISO file, which means you&#39;ll have  to use another burner application. It also lacks the ability to convert the content of your DVD to a standalone video file; instead, you’ll have to buy another module of the Total Media Converter for that tool."]},"id":"cd4c1440-bef3-471a-b9c1-299853e29e7c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"10758a56-788e-45ce-a9a7-40b474dc0b64","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Leawo DVD Copy is a decent DVD copier.
