You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Jermaine Griggs, the founder of Hear and Play makes this claim “If you can hear it you can play it”, emphasizing the ability to play anything by ear within minutes and learn any song without sheet music using his programs. You can choose between jazz, rock, hip hop, salsa and blues but the biggest emphasis is on gospel stylings and accompaniments. Compare Hear and Play to other our <a href=\"/best-learn-piano-online\">Learn Piano Online Review</a> to find specific music criteria that meet your needs.","The main course, an eBook <em>Secrets to Playing Piano by Ear</em>, is based on a step program progressing from finding a melody to adding harmony through chords and variations to ‘hearing’ chord patterns, transposing and improvising. Bonus programs include ear training, pitch perfecting, quizzes and interactive exercises with video and audio examples. Lesson plans include basic scale modulations, chord methods, and sight reading moving to chord substitutions and complex progressions. What you will not get in this program are lessons based on classical music fundamentals or proper playing technique like hand positions and movement.","Because of the depth of different improvisational lessons offered with many different packages or plans, confusion can set in. You need to know specifically what you want to learn and accomplish. There is free access to most of the music sharing and networking sites, including piano monthly newsletters. You can also upload your video or audio clips for sharing and comments. The online lesson videos are lower in quality, blurred and grainy, but the software options offer clearer visuals and audio.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"acf6e671-c7f1-43d9-ac25-dcdaef38d68c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"46b1106b-9e3d-4ee2-8329-10c64e926e7a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The website includes a lot of ad jargon to wade through before you find product details and pricing.

Thankfully, you can make monthly payments.","Many classically-trained pianists struggle with playing by ear. If you are one of them, this course is for you. Do not come here expecting to spend much time learning proper technique, fingering or extensive theory but if this is not your key motive then you will definitely find what you are looking for in the ear playing and improvisational department.
