The wing on the eRC Micro Stik is made of carbon-reinforced foam. The tiny frame is also carbon-based. A small, inexpensive brushed motor powers it. This plane weighs only 1 ounce. While the plane is lightweight, it is also fragile. One particularly powerful crash landing will have you looking for replacement parts.","As mentioned before, the transmitter (or remote control) comes with a built-in charger, which allows you to charge the LiPo batteries through the AA batteries in the transmitter. This basic three-channel transmitter will control the throttle, the elevation and the rudder, allowing you to perform basic aerobatics even in small spaces. The transmitter is a mini version of a full size one, but it is still easy to use.","The Micro Stik is manufactured by eRC, but it is distributed by Hobby Lobby. You can contact Hobby Lobby by email or phone if you have any questions regarding the Micro Stik.
