You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The HP Pavilion HPE h8m is a <a href=\"/electronics/computers\">home computer</a> that has lots of positives, but several big negatives as well. While we liked the RAM and storage options, but one of the things you will have to take into account is the fact that the support options are lacking. This isn&#39;t a concern for everyone, but if you run into issues with your computer, you might not get the help you&#39;d expect from a computer manufacturer.","What the HP Pavilion HPE h8m really has going for it are the performance factors. This home computer has one of the highest amounts of RAM of all the products we researched. At 8GB you will have no problem running multiple applications. The storage on the hard drive is 1.5TB, which is also the most we&#39;ve seen offered out of the products we reviewed. With this amount of storage available, it will take quite a while to fill up the space. The processor is an AMD Phenom X4 960T. The CPU speed is 2.9 GHz, which is really respectable for an all-purpose desktop computer. We would have liked to see a little more in the way of the clock rate, which is only 1.1 GHz, but this isn&#39;t too bad.","The features of the HP Pavilion HPE h8m have some ups and downs. One of the features we liked was the fact that it comes with Windows 7 Home Premium. While some people may not like the interface, Windows is a good choice for those of you who don&#39;t need as much control or flexibility. We also liked the fact that it comes with a memory card reader built into the tower itself. This means you don&#39;t have to purchase an additional peripheral device.  One of the features that are missing from this machine is a Blu-ray player. Though it comes with a DVD player, the gradual move away from DVDs means a Blu-ray player is increasingly important. We were also concerned that that there are only six USB ports. With so many external devices that require a USB, having more than a handful is important on a home computer.","The design of the HP Pavilion HPE h8m is 16.22 x 16.34 x 6.88 inches. This is just a little skinnier than a lot of the other product we looked at. It weighs roughly 23 pounds, so it shouldn&#39;t be a hassle to move if you need to. The tower is mostly black with just a single red line, which looks out of place but isn&#39;t too bad for a home computer.","The support for the HP Pavilion HPE h8m is where this home computer is really lacking. They do have plenty of contact options including phone, live chat and email, but they charge for these once your warranty is up. If your computer is still under warranty then it doesn&#39;t cost anything. The warranty lasts for a year so anytime after that, unless you purchase an extended warranty, you will have to pay if you want these three support options. The only support option that remains free of charge is the user forum. This is a great place to get answers to your questions without needing to pay."]},"id":"83fd25e4-d12a-4776-a8b1-91603498e62f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"85ecc89b-26ec-4ed7-ae4d-8871b4e7cded","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Pavilion HPE h8m is a computer that offers a lot in the way of the storage, memory and processing speed.
