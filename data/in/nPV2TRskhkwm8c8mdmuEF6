A computer’s drivers are critical to its overall health and ability to work, and driver update software like DriverHive can help you scan and download important updates. The software wasn’t the best at detecting drivers, and it isn’t compatible with the most recent versions of Windows. However, its automatic scan and install feature and scheduling function make it somewhat helpful to novice users.","When we tested this driver software, we found that it only detected 10 drivers out of the 277 we counted on our test computer. The best driver updaters we reviewed detected at least 69, so DriverHive really fell short here. However, for the few it did identify, it listed out basic details regarding the driver’s source and version. The software doesn’t ensure original equipment manufacturer (OEM) only updates, which could lead to a complicated mess, especially for novice users, if an update is incompatible or causes a crash. Despite having a standard array of features, it could be more intuitive and easy to use. Its lack of an exclusion option, which gives you control over which drivers get updated, hinders its ease of use.","One feature that is especially helpful to novice computer users is that it can automatically download and install any needed updates with one click. You can also schedule regular scans to run as frequently as you like. If you’re worried about a faulty update, it can help you create a backup of your drivers and even restore them. Our testing detected no bloatware or malware installed by the software.","If your Windows computer is running anything newer than Windows 7, DriverHive isn’t going to work for you. It is currently only compatible with Windows 7, XP, Vista and Windows Server 2003/2003. The company, Bootstrap Development LLC, has a few informational resources on its website about the software and provides an email address for you to reach it directly if you have questions or concerns."]},"id":"d2ad526e-310c-44b9-826b-2404abad5400","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a49d5574-361a-4666-8962-efadcb154590","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["DriverHive has a simple interface, but it could definitely be more intuitive.
