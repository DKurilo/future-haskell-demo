Interestingly enough, B&amp;H has been around since the early 1900s, and the company even made a 16mm movie camera in 1927. Current products in their lineup include electric shavers, headphones and digital cameras. The HD camcorder Bell &amp; Howell features is the DNV16HDZ, which records in full HD video.","The DNV16HDZ is a camcorder that takes care of your basic video recording needs particularly well. It shoots in 1080p full high definition video. A slight drawback is the 30 frames per second (FPS) it records in, as some of the best HD camcorders will record in 60 FPS. A higher FPS captures more frames per second, giving the video a slightly crisper picture. The optical zoom on this device is 10x, roughly average for the best HD camcorders. It also boasts a 100x digital zoom. However, be careful that you don&#39;t max out the digital zoom. The more digital zoom you use, the lower the quality of the video will be.","A unique feature that we didn&#39;t find on many camcorders we reviewed is a night vision mode. If you are looking for a camcorder that can record in the dark, for camping or security purposes, the infrared night vision function on the DNV16HDZ is more than capable of handling the task. The battery life gives an average hour of actual recording time. The camcorder also includes a slot for SD or SDHC cards. It also has a separate slot for a micro SD card as well.","Bell and Howell&#39;s customer service looks a little bare. The company provides an email service, or you can call a toll-free number for help. We were able to get our email answered after a couple tries, but the best part is that our email was directed to a person qualified to help with our specific needs. The specialized help was more than appreciated.  We would like to see Bell and Howell offer a live chat, FAQs or Forums option."]},"id":"1e65c3f2-cbb5-4186-8a91-a18f6376bc72","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"210bb0c7-92da-4c4a-8b1a-637a09b32c5c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bell &amp; Howell brand has been making camera equipment for quite some time.
