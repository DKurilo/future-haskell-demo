Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The DBTech Egg Cooker DB-EGG50 is an easy-to-use kitchen appliance that heats up quickly cooks eggs with little effort. You can make hard-, medium- or soft-cooked eggs with the steam the machine produces as it heats the water reservoir. You can cook up to seven eggs at one time. This small appliance also comes with a plastic bowl that you can use to make scrambled eggs or an omelet.","The time it takes to cook eggs is determined by the amount of water you add to this machine, and it comes with a plastic measuring cup so you can fill it precisely to the right line. We followed the instructions exactly for hard-cooked eggs but found that the results were mixed. The eggs were cooked, but each had a center that contained a soft, runny section rather than the cooked-all-the-way-through hard-boiled eggs we had expected. If you prefer eggs that, in general, are cooked to a greater degree of doneness, and still want a reasonably economical model, check out the <a href=\"/dash-go-review\">Dash Rapid Egg Cooker</a>.","With this <a href=\"/best-egg-cookers\">egg cooker</a>, the instructions tell you to pierce each egg to avoid having the eggs crack during cooking. However, the egg piercing tool that came with the model we tested was dull and actually broke four eggs before we began cooking.","After we inserted the tool very slowly and gently, we proceeded – and after 11.5 minutes, we got a final batch of eggs that were close to, but not fully, hard-cooked. It&#39;s clear that you&#39;ll need to experiment with different water levels, and with that, different times, to get truly hard-cooked eggs.","This machine has a power button that lights up so you know the machine is working and can avoid touching it when it becomes hot. This device also has an automatic shut-off feature that functions when the machine detects there is no more water in the reservoir, which is a great safety measure. You can see the eggs cooking through the clear dome-shaped lid, although steam may obscure the view a bit.","Once the egg cooking process is done, the device will sound an alert so you know it&#39;s time to remove them and plunge them into cold water to prevent any additional cooking. There are two plastic loop handles on each side of the egg tray to help you lift it out of the device.","At 6.5 inches wide and 6 inches high, this is a petite kitchen appliance that you can easily store in a cupboard or shelf, or you can leave it on your countertop if you make eggs often."]},"id":"8984847d-2e78-40b9-aada-518400e52764","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69758","url":"/db-tech-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-03-02T13:48:46Z","datePublished":"2018-03-02T13:48:46Z","name":"DB Tech Egg Cooker","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":83,"verdict":"The DBTech Egg Cooker DB-EGG50 is economical and easy to use, but you will likely have to experiment with the water levels to ensure the timing is right if you like totally hard-cooked eggs.","pros":["This machine is affordable and easy to use."],"cons":["The egg piercing tool is not very sharp.
