Being able to keep your phone in your pocket and not kink your neck while talking on the phone is a huge benefit of using Bluetooth headsets, but there is more to Bluetooth than just using it for phone conversations.","Having Bluetooth-enabled headphones or earbuds is great. Earbuds aren&#39;t as sound efficient as over-the-ear headphones, but can still pair them with many devices around your home to provide good sound quality. So what are the benefits of buying into <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">Bluetooth headphones</a>?","<strong>Cut the Cable</strong>","The biggest benefit of Bluetooth earbuds or headphones is the ability to be cord-free, as well as hands free, for ultimate mobility. How many times have the cables from your headphones caught on something, jarringly ripping the earbuds from your ears, or you pulled them out of your pocket only to find a nest of cable? No cables means zero fuss and no unwinding the knots they make in your pocket. Wireless earbuds are great devices for people who run or workout to music. In many cases, losing the wires means less battery is used. Bluetooth uses low power signals, and the technology requires very little energy.","<strong> </strong>","<strong> Sound Quality</strong>"," ","Losing the cables doesn t mean sound quality should be lost, but as with any set of headphones, this is only true if you do your homework and find a high-quality product. Many of the wireless headphones or earbuds come with bass-boosting technology and noise-isolation design so that you can feel the beat as you listen to music. When Bluetooth headphones were released, the audio was undesirable, and many people said it wouldn&#39;t last. Today, you can get the same quality of sound with wireless earphones as you can with those that are wired.","<strong>Talk, Walk and More</strong>","Whether you are walking down the street or around the home trying to get chores done, holding the phone interrupts your movement and gives you one less hand to work with. The freedom Bluetooth devices provide can make the simplest tasks easier. If you are in the middle of listening to a song and you receive a phone call, some headphones allow you to answer the phone with just the touch of a button. Pushing it again will end the call and return you to your music.","One thing to consider with wireless earbuds is the infamous driving scenario. Holding a phone and talking on it while driving is illegal in many places, and rightly so. However, if you use a Bluetooth headset, you can still talk on the phone while driving.","<strong>Stylish &amp; Affordable</strong>","Wireless earbuds and earphones are sophisticated and stylish. Many have a sporty design because they are made to stay firmly in place when you are working out or running for long distances. Even casual listeners can enjoy the sleek design of any style of wireless headphones.","Wireless doesn&#39;t always mean more expensive. Many of the Bluetooth headphones and earbuds cost less than $70, and some even come with a Bluetooth transmitter in case your phone or MP3 player isn&#39;t Bluetooth compatible. You can choose to spend hundreds of dollars, as with any electronic devices, but even low-priced wireless earbuds are comparable in quality.","<strong>Do More Than Listen</strong>","Bluetooth headphones work with more than just MP3 players and phones. Manufacturers are making everything from computers to phones and TVs Bluetooth compatible. Bluetooth-compatible TVs are quite a leap because they allow you to pair your headphones with your TV to listen to your shows or movies without bothering anyone else in the house. If you like to keep music, podcasts or other material on your TV or computer, pairing your headphones to them will give you the freedom to move around your house while not missing a beat.<strong><br/></strong>","Finding the right headphones or earbuds should just be a matter of time because so many devices are Bluetooth compatible. There are many wireless earbuds to choose from, but if you do your homework, you can find the ones that suit you best. Fortunately, our TopTenREVIEWS Bluetooth Comparison does the work for you. Listen to your music anywhere in the house, take a call from upstairs when your phone is downstairs and even sync up with your TV or computer. The possibilities are quickly becoming limitless as technology moves forward."]},"id":"2c9257a7-e352-4a73-8836-b9033343038b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7272","url":"/top-5-reasons-to-use-bluetooth-enabled-earbuds","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alex-jenkins","url":"/author/alex-jenkins","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Alex Jenkins","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"xiCNkEAAAxHKwXLBdF8fdF","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-05-11T18:58:24Z","datePublished":"2012-05-11T18:58:24Z","name":"Top 5 Reasons to Use Bluetooth Enabled Earbuds","synopsis":"There is more to embracing Bluetooth technology than being that weird person whom everyone else in the room thinks is talking to himself.","review":{},"strapline":"There is more to embracing Bluetooth technology than being that weird person whom everyone else in the room thinks is talking to himself.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-05-14T16:51:52Z","id":"iYvMYcLSLmxy65eMk6G6kc","meta":{"title":"Top 5 Reasons to Use Bluetooth Enabled Earbuds","description":"Bluetooth technology isn&#039;t new.
