In such a competitive environment, the appeal of a dedicated HD camcorder will inevitably be lost on some people. We get it – why spend hundreds of dollars on an extra device you have to lug around?","We began our research as cynically as anyone might, not expecting to find many reasons to purchase an HD camcorder. We found that while there certainly aren’t as many viable options out there as before, some of the cameras, like the Panasonic HC-X920, make a powerful case for a dedicated video camera.","That’s because the X920 offers variable optical zoom, better image quality and a better design for shooting than you can find in any current smartphone. In fact, the X920 offers the best image quality of any camcorder we tested. Though its zoom range isn’t quite as long as others and its touchscreen could be better, superior image quality makes this a high-quality camcorder."]},"id":"70904ed9-2353-416b-9d3b-0f0ec32e165b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Image Quality"},"id":"13e3bb0d-9603-4103-ade8-91c08970f2c2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/eCkNcHq5ADPrRykaP6WYLe.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Image quality in smartphone cameras has improved dramatically in recent years, but the best consumer-grade HD camcorders still have an edge over their more multipurpose counterparts.

In our tests, the X920 consistently outshined its competitors by consistently offering the best colors and clearest image.","Lens quality also plays a large part in the overall quality of your footage, and the X920 has one of the best lenses that we tested. Although its zoom range isn’t enormous when compared to the <a href=\"/panasonic-hc-w580-review\">Panasonic HC-W580,</a> it has the fastest lens that we tested with a max aperture of f/1.5. That means this lens can direct more light to the sensor than any other camcorder we tested, resulting in improved low light performance.","With a max resolution of 20.4 megapixels for still images, it offers respectable performance for a video-first device. We’d like to emphasize, however, that in most cases, still imaging performance shouldn’t be overly influential in your decision. Still, being able to produces high-resolution photos is useful if you need to shoot stills and video simultaneously – or if you’d like to zoom in and snap some shots in a way that you couldn’t on your smartphone."]},"id":"2200692f-8c2d-4348-a592-814c09b1b7a6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"e22fb46d-271e-4ec0-892e-5436ad8d0557","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/MGw7GxGmEqbXcAfdZREqKf.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"How easy or difficult your camera is to use can mean the difference between fumbling with your device and capturing the moment at hand.
