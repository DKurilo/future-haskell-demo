Vizio uses the SmartCast platform to stream content on both your LED TV and on the tablet remote that comes with the TV. The pairing of the remote and TV is innovative, but it does come with some hassles.","Before we even started watching the TV, we had some pairing issues with the TV/remote and our Wi-Fi. All other TVs, including other Vizio sets, connected to our Wi-Fi network quickly, but we had to start the processes over several times before we were able to get this TV set up.","During our testing, we viewed the same UHD, HD and 4K content on each television. We streamed a 4K performance from Emi Meyer that truly pushes color accuracy and refresh rates to the limits. The color saturation was decent, though other sets we reviewed ranked higher. Emi Meyer&#39;s red dress was a little flat and not as vibrant as on other sets. We noticed a fair amount of halo lighting around some of the instruments, including the saxophone. There was also a little bit of visual noise when the LED TV tried to render the pattern of the microphone. The small metallic weaving pattern made the head of the mic look like TV static in that small area. While the overall quality of the video was good, it did reveal some minor issues the TV has when it is pushed.","As we watched &#34;Gravity&#34; we noticed the same type of halo lighting around the space shuttle. The title scene from &#34;The Martian&#34; also had this issue. This is a common problem with many of the full array backlit displays we tested.","We continued to test the displays with Calman software, a test pattern generator and a sensor to help us determine the color accuracy and contrast ratio of each LED 4K TV. As we expected, there were a handful of other TVs that ranked better in terms of color accuracy, but the Vizio M55 also outperformed a handful as well â€“ it was right in the middle of the pack. We were surprised that this TV ranked as one of the better sets for contrast ratio according to our test results. It outperformed a few other sets ranked above it. A higher contrast ratio makes the picture on the screen really pop.","The tablet remote is a great idea, but the idea is not fully cooked yet. We had our share of issues with the remote. The remote comes with a charging dock. If you don&#39;t remember to put the remote on the charging dock at the end of the day, much like many smartphones, it will be dead the next morning. Another issue we had with the tablet remote was system updates and buffering. There were a few system updates within a week, some of which took over 15 minutes for the update to fully install. During this time, you can&#39;t use the tablet. There were also a handful of times when we wanted to change something quickly, like the display mode from standard to calibrated. We would click the button on the only to get the dreaded loading spin-wheel for an extended period of time before the function went through. The Vizio does come with a traditional remote, but it is much more basic and includes significantly less functionality than the tablet remote.","The remote wasn&#39;t all frustration. When it was working, it does offer great features. It uses Google as its web browser and allows you to connect to all your Google accounts via the tablet. It is also set up like an Android device, so if you are comfortable with Android smartphones, you&#39;ll be right at home.","This Vizio 4K TV features four HDMI ports and two USB ports. The Vizio M series is available in a handful of different sizes from 50 inches all the way up to 80 inches. It is covered by a one-year warranty from the date of purchase."]},"id":"baf90430-dce8-4834-ac21-06fb71533c39","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"13e6af81-9d78-4efb-83a6-ae667dfc2a17","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Vizio M55-D0 is a solid LED TV that comes with a tablet remote that has some really great features and some headaches as well.
