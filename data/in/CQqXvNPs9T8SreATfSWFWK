You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Few electric <a href=\"/best-chainsaws\">chainsaws</a> are able to compete with the raw power and efficiency of their gas-powered counterparts, but the Makita UC3530A certainly gives them a run for their money. Thanks to its one-touch, tool-less blade and chain adjustment tools, this device is easy to maintain. It&#39;s also a quiet operator.","The Makita UC3530A is capable of a chain speed of 2,600 FPM on its 14-inch saw. The compact design of the device creates the illusion of a rather tame and tempered device that is in truth quite capable of heavy and continuous cutting. Weighing in at barely less than 11 pounds, this device goes a long way toward operator comfort in allowing for one-handed use (an activity only advisable with the correct safety gear). The handles are ergonomically designed and include a rubberized grip, giving added cushion to the operator’s hands and allowing for longer periods of use for a wider range of maneuvers."]},"id":"23f8c0eb-b17c-4efa-8b1f-a77f24447294","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/frhrdzKLBvYMKTgSnJQtx8.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56685-makita-uc3530a2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/frhrdzKLBvYMKTgSnJQtx8.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"frhrdzKLBvYMKTgSnJQtx8","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/frhrdzKLBvYMKTgSnJQtx8.jpg","alt":""},"id":"700b823c-c607-4a2e-acbd-80cc2c296fe2","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As mentioned previously, the Makita UC3530A utilizes tool-less blade and chain adjustment, allowing even first-time chainsaw owners to maintain the device with relative ease. The oil reservoir contained within this chainsaw is quite large, ensuring that you don&#39;t need to add oil very often. Another perk is a view window through which you can see the bar oil level. However, the downside of this chainsaw is that the oil it uses can get quite expensive in comparison to others and may prove difficult to find.","Since the Makita UC3530A is an electric chainsaw, it’s quite easy to start and doesn’t require any gas mixtures. Simply pulling the trigger on the soft start will activate the chainsaw immediately. The ease of activation and use will factor heavily in this chainsaw’s favor, though the price tag will be daunting to some. This chainsaw offers an inherent value few other devices can achieve through simple electricity, which can make price a less important element to consider.","Where alternatives to gas-powered chainsaws are concerned, the Makita UC3530A is an excellent machine to consider. It may not achieve the same power levels as gas-powered devices, but it still packs enough power to shrink the difference noticeably. Reputed as one of the best electric chainsaws available, this device is an ideal choice for anyone who needs to cut serious branches but doesn&#39;t want a gas-powered behemoth."]},"id":"aeb29e5c-a101-439f-9728-d5bb07860cdf","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56713","url":"/makita-chain-saw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
