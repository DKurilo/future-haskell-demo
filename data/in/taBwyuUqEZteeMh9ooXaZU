It has the same format compatibility as the best voice recording programs in our comparison as well as an easy-to-use interface.","This software can record your voice or other audio with line-in devices like a microphone. It can also record audio playback from your computer. The Recording Tool window has several options to define parameters, like input devices, channel, volume, audible threshold, silence threshold, input and output formats, and even MP3, WMA and OGG settings.","The program lacks a voice-activated recording function. However, there is a record timer function which lets you schedule a recording for a future time. The timer allows you to dictate the duration of the future recording. If you need voice-activated recording as an on-hand option, check out <a href=\"/goldwave-review\">GoldWave</a>.","Both analog and digital rips are supported, and the ripped files can be directly saved to MP3, WMA, WAV and OGG formats. The software has a built-in CD/DVD burner that is compatible with the same formats.","The audio recording software has many of the standard audio filters and effects commonly used in audio editing, such as pop and click removal, noise reduction, pitch shifting, amplify, mix, reverb and fade in/out. You can also compress files with this software. These tools can improve the sound of your recordings by removing background noise, extended periods of silence and high notes in speech.","Other tools like change format, split and the integrated ID3 tag editor facilitate file conversion and better file management and indexing, respectively. The merge file option can be used to merge two or more voice recording files. This tool is useful when piecing together discussions that were recorded using individual speech sources, combining them for final production.","Blaze Media Pro supports a variety of formats, such as MP3, CDA, WAV, RAW, MIDI, OGG, FLAC, M4A and AAC for opening projects and files. Recorded projects or files can be saved to WAV, MP3, WMA and OGG formats.","Blaze lacks compatibility with several significant operating systems. It isn’t available for Mac OS X or Linux, and only runs on Windows 7 or earlier versions. Although the software’s interface has a rather outdated and cluttered feel, functions and options are labeled clearly, and the software is easy to use overall.","Technical support representatives for the software are only available via email. The company doesn’t provide a phone number or live chat option for more direct communication. Nonetheless, there are a few informational resources available on the website.","Blaze Media Pro is positioned right in the middle of the price range in our comparison, it is easy to use, and it’s packed with all the features you’ll need to record and edit your audio. Though it misses the mark with operating system compatibility, it offers great compatibility with input sources and file formats, making it a reasonable choice."]},"id":"3402c4cd-03c7-4cd3-a504-9855045b5aca","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49067","url":"/blaze-media-pro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-03-23T16:00:32Z","datePublished":"2010-03-23T16:00:32Z","name":"Blaze Media Pro","synopsis":"Blaze Media Pro is not just voice recording software – it can also rip, convert and edit your audio files, helping you create high-quality recordings.","review":{"rating":82,"verdict":"Blaze Media Pro is solid voice recording software with great format and input source compatibility.","pros":["It has powerful audio editing and converting capabilities."],"cons":["It doesn&#8217;t have voice-activated recording functionality."]},"strapline":"Blaze Media Pro is not just voice recording software – it can also rip, convert and edit your audio files, helping you create high-quality recordings.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-09T00:00:00Z","id":"taBwyuUqEZteeMh9ooXaZU","meta":{"title":"Blaze Media Pro Voice Recording Software Review","description":"Blaze Media Pro is solid voice recording software with great format and input source compatibility."},"products":[{"slug":"blaze-media-pro","url":"/product/blaze-media-pro","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:20:00Z","name":"Blaze Media Pro","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:20:00Z","id":"5oyEMrwNXsGA6N5SXGAidk","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-05T14:20:00Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/6uSSeE5v3roMqTvBhLHQL8.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:20:00Z","mimeType":"","name":"6971d189ab18f1c74822d57d940052fa.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/6971d189ab18f1c74822d57d940052fa.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:20:00Z","id":"6uSSeE5v3roMqTvBhLHQL8","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6uSSeE5v3roMqTvBhLHQL8.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Blaze Media Pro Voice Recording Software Review","description":"Blaze Media Pro is solid voice recording software with great format and input source compatibility."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/6uSSeE5v3roMqTvBhLHQL8.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:20:00Z","mimeType":"","name":"6971d189ab18f1c74822d57d940052fa.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/6971d189ab18f1c74822d57d940052fa.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:20:00Z","id":"6uSSeE5v3roMqTvBhLHQL8","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6uSSeE5v3roMqTvBhLHQL8.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Blaze Media Pro Voice Recording Software Review","description":"Blaze Media Pro is solid voice recording software with great format and input source compatibility."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/software/multimedia/best-voice-recording-software/blaze-media-pro-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:20:00Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:20:00Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"audio-production","url":"/hobbies/audio-production","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T14:20:00Z","name":"Audio Production","dateModified":"2019-04-05T14:20:00Z","id":"JakJdN7Gfzy3SwVYuaDJCJ","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
