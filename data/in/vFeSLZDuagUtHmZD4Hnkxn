You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The YardGard YG03 Gate, Door and Window Alarm uses a magnetic sensor to sound an alarm when someone opens an entrance. The alarm sounds immediately when the barrier is broken, which complies with barrier codes in most states. The alarm features a single pass-button with a seven-second delay for adults. While only practical for keeping children out of fenced-in pool areas, the YardGard alarm is water resistant and works on both indoor and outdoor entrances.","YardGard&#39;s <a href=\"/best-pool-alarms\">pool gate alarm</a> features mounts that allow it to attach easily onto doors, gates and windows with minimal installation. Once set up, the alarm is always on and sounds a loud 120-decibel alarm for three minutes or until reset, when the magnetic sensor picks up a disconnect. Because the alarm sounds instantly, you have time to get to the pool area before anyone gets in. This also allows the siren to comply with most barrier regulations for child safety.","While the alarm sounds at 120 decibels, it is only 95 decibels at 10 feet and rapidly lowers in volume as you get further away. Because it does not feature a remote alarm, your pool does have to be relatively close to the house in order for you to hear the alarm properly indoors. You also need separate alarms for each door, as one only covers one entrance.","The pass button pauses the alarm for seven seconds for an adult, or child, to go through, which is not long unless you hurry. Because it is an instant reset button, the alarm immediately activates again so that anyone passing through has to use the button again. If installed low to the ground, children can use the alarm, but when it is installed on a gatepost or high fence, it effectively keeps young children out and safely away from the pool.","The YardGard works effectively for alerting you when a window, door or gate opens, and it works well as a pool gate alarm for fenced or walled pools. Because it does not sound an alert when someone gets into the pool, you may want a separate alarm for this function. The alarm is loud enough to serve as an initial alert when someone tries to go into the pool unsupervised, but it is not loud enough to alert you if you live in a large home. However, it does offer basic protection and alerts you when someone is in your pool, especially when the pool is close to the house."]},"id":"2651707e-27b9-44c4-9b24-7cf9e682ff4d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63626","url":"/yardgard-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-23T20:53:41Z","datePublished":"2015-03-23T20:53:41Z","name":"Yardgard YG03","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-23T20:53:41Z","id":"vFeSLZDuagUtHmZD4Hnkxn","meta":{"title":"Yardgard YG03 Pool Alarm Review","description":"The YardGard YG03 is only practical for keeping children out of fenced-in pool areas, but it is always on and sounds a very loud alarm when triggered."},"products":[{"slug":"yardgard-yg03","url":"/product/yardgard-yg03","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:50Z","name":"Yardgard YG03","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:50Z","id":"JZ2UUdS4ohH2ZkBbSBXtPb","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:15:51Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/KtuMjawkTHVGW3umMkg7zd.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:50Z","mimeType":"","name":"63598-yardgard-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63598-yardgard-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:50Z","id":"KtuMjawkTHVGW3umMkg7zd","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KtuMjawkTHVGW3umMkg7zd.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Yardgard YG03 Pool Alarm Review","description":"The YardGard YG03 is only practical for keeping children out of fenced-in pool areas, but it is always on and sounds a very loud alarm when triggered."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/KtuMjawkTHVGW3umMkg7zd.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:50Z","mimeType":"","name":"63598-yardgard-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63598-yardgard-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:50Z","id":"KtuMjawkTHVGW3umMkg7zd","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KtuMjawkTHVGW3umMkg7zd.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Yardgard YG03 Pool Alarm Review","description":"The YardGard YG03 is only practical for keeping children out of fenced-in pool areas, but it is always on and sounds a very loud alarm when triggered."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/family/best-pool-alarms/yardgard-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:50Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:50Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"pool-and-hot-tub","url":"/home-and-garden/pool-and-hot-tub","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:50Z","name":"Pool & Hot Tub","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:50Z","id":"Snsyvysc6JMsPB5BLBFHBh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
