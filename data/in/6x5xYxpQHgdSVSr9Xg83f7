You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.","The last place you&#39;d expect to see gamification is in reading, but Kobo believes that book lovers want to be rewarded for their accomplishments. The Kobo Aura HD rewards you when you improve your reading speed, finish books and more. However, it&#39;s hard to justify this <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eBook reader&#39;s</a> hefty price tag. With a variety of file sources and multiple ways to add files to the eReader, you are not locked into a single store. Although it has a large and beautiful screen, it lacks the simplicity of  the Kindle and Nook eReaders. It has some standout features, like its front-lit screen and open platform, but many of its abilities may be lost on most book lovers.","One of the Kobo Aura HD&#39;s standout features is its social functionality, much of which involves earning badges and achieving goals. The e-ink reader displays your completion percentage for every book you read as well as your reading stats, including your average reading speed and number of page turns. All of this translates into accomplishments similar to what gamers earn as they complete games. Like gaming accomplishments, you can share your progress through social networks.","However, there is a very limited audience for this feature. Even our most dedicated gamers saw little use for the Aura HD&#39;s social features, claiming they felt more like a distraction from the actual books. If you have children or teens and you&#39;d like to see their reading improve, the social elements may prove useful, but for most book lovers, there&#39;s little use for this extra feature.","Instead, the device should be judged by its attractive and large screen as well as its open operating system. At 6.8 inches, the Aura HD has one of the largest e-ink displays we&#39;ve ever seen. The eBook reader is a little bulkier and heavier than others, but thanks to its front-lit screen, you can read it whenever you&#39;d like. The casing has odd hand grooves that don&#39;t add much to the portability or usability.","You can buy books from the Kobo store or add a variety of file types directly from your PC. This open system makes the eReader more complicated than Kindles and Nooks, but it offers more reading options."]},"id":"41922c0c-047e-4df4-93d1-13f97459dc95","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"185f585e-dd33-4892-a192-2e2b969e0452","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kobo Aura HD is an open and social eBook reader, but many of its gamification features are wasted on book lovers.
