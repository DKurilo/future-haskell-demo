While you should avoid it for long trips or as your primary car seat, the Scenera will work for a few years as both a rear-facing and front-facing seat. However, it lacks energy-absorbing foam and an adjustable headrest.","The Scenera passes all safety tests, although it does not have all the features that we prefer. It does not have energy-absorbing foam, which would reduce the amount of force in an accident. It also lacks an adjustable headrest. Fortunately, it has LATCH connectors and level indicators for easy installation.","In its rear-facing position, the Scenera can secure a child between 5 and 35 pounds, making it a good option for newborns. Then, when your child is at least a year old and 22 pounds, you can switch the seat to its front-facing position to support your child until he is 40 pounds. For the average child, this convertible car seat should last four years.","The cushions do not have much padding, so your baby will start to get uncomfortable during long trips. At only 6 pounds, it&#39;s a lightweight car seat that is FAA compliant, so you&#39;ll have no problem taking it on airplanes. Like all convertible car seats, the Scenera is not compatible with any strollers or travel systems. It also does not have a canopy to protect your child from the weather.","Cosco supports the Scenera with a one-year warranty, and if you lose your user manual, you can find a new one online. Customer service is available by phone and email. We never made contact through email, but we were able to leave a message by phone and eventually got a callback."]},"id":"0d4ac563-acc6-4412-8462-ba6ec5529235","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b1e7f7c8-316c-41f9-94f7-064382731636","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cosco Scenera may be a cheap baby car seat, but it still meets all federal crash safety requirements.
