This kitchen thermometer is NSF certified for public health and safety – the NSF mark means a product has been tested by an independent agency to ensure it meets quality and public health standards. Consider this thermometer for accurate home or commercial use for candy making, deep frying and checking the temperature on a variety of foods. It is a great option but if you prefer a digital display, consider the <a href=\"/best-candy-thermometers\">Maverick CT-03</a>.","The CDN IRXL-400’s round dial measures from 100 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit with an easy-to-read, 1.75-inch display. The thermometer’s 7-inch stem is long enough to reach into a full pot, and a handy clip allows you to affix the thermometer to the pot for ongoing reading. A color-coded scale helps you know when you have reached various heat zones, and field calibration gives you a more accurate reading degree-by-degree.","This <a href=\"/best-candy-thermometers\">candy thermometer</a> is designed for candy and jelly making, but it can also be used to check the temperature of oil for deep frying. Since the gauge sits on a metal stem, you can use this thermometer to check the temperature of meats, poultry, breads or cakes.","The CDN IRXL 400 ProAccurate Candy and Deep Fry Thermometer comes with a food-safe ABS plastic sheath – ABS plastic is a low-hazard material that can withstand high heat. Use the sheath to store the thermometer when it is not in use, or turn the sheath around and use it as a handle extension for safer temperature readings. The sheath also features a pocket clip to keep the thermometer in place in your pocket.","This candy thermometer delivers accurate readings quickly, but note that it is an analog thermometer, so you won’t get readings as quickly as you might with a digital thermometer. This is something to keep in mind, if speed is your main concern.","Overall, with its ability to read temperatures on the fly and its portability and safety aspects, the CDN IRXL400 ProAccurate Candy and Deep Fry Thermometer is a solid choice for taking the temperature of a wide variety of foods."]},"id":"ebc71baa-a25d-4bf4-ae40-686740da81ad","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63284","url":"/cdn-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-06T23:04:49Z","datePublished":"2015-03-06T23:04:49Z","name":"CDN IRXL400 ProAccurate","synopsis":"The CDN IRXL400 ProAccurate Candy and Deep Fry Thermometer is designed for professional use, and it is also very handy for home cooks.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The CDN IRXL400 ProAccurate Candy and Deep Fry Thermometer is designed for professional use, and it is also very handy for home cooks.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-06T23:04:49Z","id":"voYLJYYqBGf4v5LQtmRGWi","meta":{"title":"CDN IRXL400 ProAccurate Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of CDN IRXL400 ProAccurate.
