Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Cobra XRS 9965 <a href=\"/best-radar-detectors\">radar detector</a> includes a 1.5-inch color touch screen display and is GPS ready. However, you need to purchase the optional GPS Locator (GPSL) in order to use it. The GPSL also requires a subscription to the AURA database to keep the locations of fixed cameras up to date. On the other hand, this is a good investment if you are looking for a device with red light detection.","The 1.5-inch color touch screen is designed to make it easy for you to set up and configure Cobra XRS 996. The philosophy from Cobra is all you have to do is touch and go. However, if you have large fingers you may have problems touching the screen in the correct spot every time. This can also be difficult and possibly dangerous when you are traveling at highway speeds. In addition, the touch screen tends to wash out and is hard to read in bright or direct sunlight.","The XRS 9965 includes voice alerts so you do not have to rely on the display to know what is going on. The best radar detectors include voice alert options that tell you plainly and clearly, which type of radar band is detected. This option is good if you are in unfamiliar surroundings and need to keep your eyes glued to the road. In addition to voice alerts there are tone alerts that sound a different tone for each type of signal the unit detects. The voice and tone alerts make it very easy for you to concentrate on your driving.","This model has a feature called IntelliMute, which automatically mutes the detector based on your current speed. If the XRS 9965 senses that you are moving slowly or you are stopped, it automatically mutes all alerts because you do not need to hear them.","The Cobra XRS 9965 radar detector responds to all types of radar currently used by law enforcement agencies. It also detects all types of laser guns and can warn you about the use of Instant-On devices and radar guns with POP mode.","Cobra radar detectors come with a one year limited warranty that protects against defects in workmanship and design. The Cobra website includes a FAQs page to answer common questions about its radar detectors and other products. You can also send questions by email or talk to a customer support representative on the telephone.","These radar detectors have decent range and good signal strength. It also does a good job of filtering out false alerts so you do not have constant beeps or buzzes to drive you crazy while you are concentrating on the road."]},"id":"d4eaedab-155f-4dc5-8e0f-98ea4f1cbe3f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7cc13f78-1732-40f8-85ca-2f12f088bc84","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Cobra XRS 9965 is user friendly and reliable, making it a good choice in radar detectors.
