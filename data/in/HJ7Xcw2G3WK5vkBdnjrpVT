The 65-foot detection range is excellent, but the detection angle is only 35 degrees, about 30 percent weaker than most of the trail cameras we reviewed. This means the camera could miss some animals on the edge of the detection zone that another trail cam would be able to capture.","The trigger speed of the Razor 8 is just 1 second, which is quick enough to  capture even the fastest animals passing through the detection zone. However, its 15-second recovery time between shots means you may only get one shot of a deer walking past the camera.","Unfortunately, the Razor 8 doesn&#39;t have a multi-shot mode, so it can only take one photo or video per trigger. However, it does have a time-lapse option, so you can program it to shoot a photo at a set interval. For example, you could tell it to shoot one photo every hour, regardless of any motion detected. It comes with software that lets you easily turn those photos into a time-lapse video.","In our experience, the Wildgame Innovations&#39; customer service representatives we spoke to had limited knowledge about the products. The company also does not offer email support, which is a pretty standard offering by the other manufacturers whose products we reviewed."]},"id":"572d24df-9ef4-49c4-8762-3c5b41059a88","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8c60aa0d-4c80-4e02-9cbb-e6c5ce997e63","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Razor 8 offers excellent flash power and good image quality, but this wildlife camera&#39;s detection zone is disappointingly narrow.
