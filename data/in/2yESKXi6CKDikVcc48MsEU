Instead its resolution is 1280 x 1024, or 1.3 megapixels. This is slightly better than 720p HD quality video. Though this <a href=\"/best-webcams\">webcam</a> can capture video at 1.3 megapixels, the video is much smoother at a lower resolution.","The one thing that is incredible about Manhattan webcams is the ability to interpolate still images at high megapixels. The 860 Pro webcam can take up to 21-megapixel photos. Some of the best rated webcams that we have reviewed top out around 15 megapixels. This webcam has stepped up the game in photo quality.","The 860 Pro has a nice set of features that you like to see come along with a webcam. There is some video editing software so you can add fun effects to your videos and post them online to a variety of social media networks with the one-click uploading feature.","One thing that we didn’t like about this webcam is that the focus is fixed. Objects that come closer or further away from the camera may easily fall out of focus. This is why an autofocus lens can come in handy.  Even though this webcam has a fixed focus, using the software you can digitally zoom the image up to 4x. Only a handful of webcams we reviewed have that capability.","The design of the webcam allows you to clip onto a laptop or desktop screen. The camera is relatively small and connects to your computer via USB. The 860 Pro is compatible with both Mac and PC operating systems so you won’t have to worry about compatibility issues. The one thing that we really liked about the design of the webcam is its ability to rotate a full 360 degrees and tilt up and down. This allows you to stay in frame no matter where you may be standing.","One place where Manhattan lacks is in the customer service department. Even though they offer a lifetime warranty on this webcam, the only way you are able to contact Manhattan is through the technical support forum. It would be nice to be able to contact the manufacturer via telephone or email."]},"id":"24fda662-7507-42de-a054-ba5e0b351763","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3b183e8b-6915-476a-ab17-a6cb2178b333","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Manhattan Widescreen HD 860 Pro can take better photos than any other webcam that we reviewed.
