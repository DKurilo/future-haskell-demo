Imagine Pro lets you import a photo of your yard and then helps you make alterations and additions to it using an extensive visual library of flowers, trees, and other landscaping features. The program doesn&#39;t, however, offer 3-D features or interior home design tools.

If you can’t find the images you want through the library, you can copy any image from the Internet—such as a unique front door—to incorporate into your plan.","After you enter a scale of reference—such as your front door height—textures (such as brick) are auto–scaled to fit, but you can also resize any objects (plants, outdoor furniture) to your liking. You can also tweak your finished view by adding details like shadows and editing lighting effects, like brightness, contrast and hue.","This program doesn’t offer 3–D features, so you can’t move around your finished landscape to view. To see your landscaped home from all sides, you’ll have to import and landscape additional photos of all sides.","Image Pro comes with a second disc DeltaCad, a program that produces 2D mechanical drawings for drafting plans in both Metric and English units.
