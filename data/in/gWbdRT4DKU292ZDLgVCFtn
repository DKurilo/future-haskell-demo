The Whirlpool EV205NXTN upright freezer missed our number one spot due to its lack of external temperature indicator, but far out ranked the other freezers in our lineup with its sleek design and extra features like a storage gate and being ice maker ready."]},"id":"b3a0e4e4-2d40-4fe6-8a18-23a9a5d263d3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Energy Cost &amp; Efficiency"},"id":"5906c453-5924-4db6-ba5c-9e532f04929f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Inside the Whirlpool EV205NXTN you’ll find four slide-out shelves that are adjustable as well as a mid basket and a bottom storage basket. On the door there are six adjustable bins that can be altered for taller or shorter items. Needless to say, there is a spot for everything, and organizing your frozen food is a cinch – which is a very good quality to have because with a capacity of 20.1 cubic feet, you can fit over 700 pounds of food in this upright freezer. Once all of your food is properly stowed away, it is easily found again with an interior light bright enough to find even the most cleverly hidden bag of corn. Your food is also protected from devious teenagers and sticky-fingered children with a key-eject lock.. The key-eject lock is specifically designed to keep children out by only opening if the key is pushed while being turned. Finally, the appliance also boasts a temperature monitor which keeps track of the internal temperature, and if it is higher than a set number, it will audibly warn you. This temperature monitor will also alert you if the door has been left ajar.","Most importantly, the Whirlpool EV205NXTN upright freezer is Energy Star qualified. In order to receive this title, upright freezers must be at least 10% more energy efficient than the minimum federal standard, and these qualification requirements are ever increasing. The Whirlpool EV205NXTN meets these guidelines and has a low estimated yearly operating cost of only $71. The Energy Star website claims that you can save $70 each year in energy costs if you switch all of your appliances to more energy efficient products."]},"id":"feaeb085-5306-45fa-8aaa-19e47d25ef23","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Dimensions &amp; Warranty"},"id":"9e427ae0-39f3-4b01-a7a3-8c9220627970","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool EV205NXTN is more than just an upright freezer, it is a frozen playground with toys you never thought you needed, but once used, you won’t be able to live without them.

This feature is great for when you come home from a big sale on frozen vegetables or you find yourself with  a nice slab of fresh venison. This feature is also very nice when you initially fill it up; it goes to work quickly and efficiently freezing everything.","Frost Free – Put away your chisels and rubber gloves, there is no need to de-ice this freezer. The Frost Free feature continually defrosts any ice buildup on a daily basis. The cooling coil warms up slightly sporadically throughout the day to melt off any built up frost, and air is circulated to collect excess moisture, delivering it to the warmed cooling coil to melt away.","Ice maker Ready – This upright freezer is built to be able to hold an ice maker. Granted, you will have to purchase the ice maker separately, but imagine never having to run out to buy ice again. Combined with the ice made in your kitchen freezer, you’ll have an unlimited supply of ready-made ice.","Power On Light – A light indicating whether the freezer is running or not is located on the right side of the bottom grill. This convenient notification helps you know if the power has gone out.","Storage Gate – A gate that swings up and latches to contain food that may not completely fit on the shelf. This blockade protects you from unwanted food avalanches and allows more food to be stuffed, or rather, stored in the freezer."],"type":"ul"},"id":"bd106806-16e1-4206-b77d-22baf306fb54","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As previously mentioned, the Whirlpool EV205NXTN upright freezer is missing external temperature controls.

The contoured door means the front sides are slightly curved, giving the façade a clean, modern look while hiding the hinges. In the height department this freezer is a little bit shorter than others at 67 inches, but it comes with adjustable leveling legs that allow you to make it taller. It also comes with rollers that make movement easy on rollable surfaces. If the Whirlpool EV205NXTN will be making its home in the garage, for example, the rollers are a necessity.
