This power can increase your productivity as you tackle your projects, whether they are big or small. Holding this router in your hand and directing it can be a little overwhelming at first, but with practice, you&#39;ll be creating designs, trimming and cutting with precision in no time at all.","This palm router utilizes Makita’s unique rack-and-pinion adjustment platform, which allows you to choose accurate settings. Its overall design is compact, sleek and comfortable. It’s an attractive tool, with its teal-blue top, black trim and silver aluminum and can be a great addition to your workshop’s tool lineup. The best palm routers start without jerking, and the Makita RT0701CX7 starts up smoothly and quietly, allowing you to remain in control of the tool right from the beginning.","Visibility is essential while you are using a palm router and it is easy to maintain a good line of sight while you use this Makita compact router. This allows for greater precision as you make your initial cut-in and continues as you work.","The Makita compact router features a lock system with quick-release tabs, which means less interrupted time while crafting your project. The quick release tabs let you switch out bases and adjust your depth with ease, allowing your directed cutting, molding or edging to flow, ultimately saving you time and frustration.","This palm router is tough and rugged, with the motor housed in aluminum and double insulated. Changing bits is made a bit more stable, as this router is designed with a flat top. It also features convenient depth scales. The power switch is a rocker switch, located on the top front.","The Makita RT0701CX7 is 7-7/8 “ long, weighs 3.9 pounds, has a 6.5 amp motor, and comes with a ¼ “ collet and an instruction manual. As far as warranty, Makita starts the buyer out with a 30-day replacement offer, where they will replace a defective model for free, and provides an additional one-year warranty."]},"id":"b3e297ef-25cf-4f44-a690-fc73fe04e5ee","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61658","url":"/makita-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-17T19:31:57Z","datePublished":"2014-12-17T19:31:57Z","name":"Makita RT0701CX7","synopsis":"With Makita’s Compact Router, you get a small-sized powerhouse tool that delivers 1.25 HP with an RPM range of 10,000 – 30,000.
