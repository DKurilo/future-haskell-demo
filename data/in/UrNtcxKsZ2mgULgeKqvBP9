It was designed with the homeowner in mind, enabling operators to perform cutting jobs on both light and medium tasks. It’s quite capable of prolonged use if you find yourself needing to regularly cut down trees for firewood, and it operates just fine as a simple tree pruner and wood splitter.","In terms of fuel efficiency, the chainsaw works on a rather average level. While you likely won’t find improved fuel consumption on this device, you will find it performs with the same power as most any other chainsaw. Despite any potential for reduced fuel efficiency, this tool still proves very efficient from a cutting standpoint. If you test it against trees up to 12 inches in diameter, the power of its 42 cc engine and 16-inch bar can easily handle the workload."]},"id":"1d38389d-f967-4fce-b8f4-26ba09409df6","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Y76JBUzuLsxDhYxof2bUP4.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56691-homelit-ut105601.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y76JBUzuLsxDhYxof2bUP4.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Y76JBUzuLsxDhYxof2bUP4","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y76JBUzuLsxDhYxof2bUP4.jpg","alt":""},"id":"bc3d5b6b-7812-482a-a7f6-1937d7c33b4a","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Power, combined with ease of use, makes this device a good value in the end. While this chainsaw does require that you put it together after the initial purchase, the bar and chain are very easy to mount so long as you follow the instructions carefully. In addition to being easy to use, the Homelite lives up to its quality rating by the simple fact that this chainsaw is capable of living a rather lengthy life. Many chainsaw reviews for this product report that it lasts an average of seven years, which is around the expected industry norm for quality chainsaws.","The design of the exterior shell is well-thought-out, ensuring a quality experience for operators when handling and maneuvering the saw. Considering that this isn’t a timber saw, it will require a great deal more maneuvering to strategically cut down larger trees, though this device is easy enough to grip even through those pesky projects.","The Homelite UT10569 proves it is a chainsaw well worth its price. It comes equipped with all the features you need to cut small and medium branches. The design of the chainsaw allows for reduced fatigue on the operator while still maximizing results in the number and size of trees cut. While this is not a full-fledged timber saw, it still performs the basic job of pruning trees and cutting wood. "]},"id":"afc4d007-fdef-4b17-8cdf-d4ae24cbb5fa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56719","url":"/homelite-chain-saw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
