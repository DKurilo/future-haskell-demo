You will find this lawn mower is designed well and it packs enough power to ensure a clean, smooth lawn.","When we tested this push gas lawn mower, we found it has one of the best bag capacities of any model in our lineup, which makes maintenance much easier since you do not have to empty it so often.","There are six cutting positions, which is about average for a self-propelled lawn mower, so you can adjust it to the length of your grass. We gave the mower an overall performance score of 90 percent, reflecting the ease with which it cut during our testing process.","The rear wheels are variable, giving this lawn mower strong self-propulsion. The wheel height has four-lever adjustment, giving you freedom to set the mower at a fitting level for your lawn. No quick-wash port is built in, so you have to flip the mower over to clean out stuck-on clippings.","The handle cushioning is one of the best features of this lawn mower, providing protection from jolts during use. The handles are also built to be easily maneuverable, making the experience less tiring for you. There is also an efficient mulching function.","This otherwise useful and versatile lawn mower does have a few flaws. Its noise level is 98.5 dB, which is high enough that it could be disruptive if you have noise-sensitive neighbors. If you need a softer sounding mower, consider the <a href=\"/craftsman-review\">Craftsman 37744</a>. In our tests, the Honda HRR was difficult to start and required several attempts before it revved up.","The weight of the Honda HRR is only 84 pounds, one of the lowest on our lineup. The handle height is also moderately low at 41 inches, which makes this lawn mower easy for you to move if you are not exceptionally tall or strong. The engine is only 160cc, which is smaller than some models but not at all weak.","You have a warranty of three years, which is standard for a gas lawn mower. There are also the essential support services, like phone, email and a service center locator. The user manual is comprehensive and useful.","With a comfortable design and low weight, the Honda HRR216K9VK has plenty to offer any yard enthusiast. It was easy to use and performed well in our tests. While it is loud and lacks extras like a quick-wash port, it is a powerful, reasonably-priced mower, that we recommend for a mid-sized yard."]},"id":"8409bcfc-230f-4a34-9d63-04984f282a97","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64899","url":"/honda-hrr-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-18T14:55:17Z","datePublished":"2015-05-18T14:55:17Z","name":"Honda HRR 216K9VKA","synopsis":"The Honda HRR216K9VK is a gas lawn mower with impressive features and performance capability.
