It measures 12 feet across and carries a three-year warranty. At 12 feet, this solar pool cover is ideal for small to midsized curved and irregularly shaped swimming pools. Its material is a resinous polymer that is both durable and protective. Besides providing passive solar heating for your pool, the Standard Blue Solar Cover also keeps out dirt and debris. This round solar pool blanket has a thickness of 8 mils. Compared to most pool covers, it is rather thin. However, this also makes it lighter than a regular pool cover. On the other hand, it cannot trap as much thermal energy as thicker blankets.","Like most solar covers, the Standard Blue Solar Cover has an underside covered with raised air pockets. These form into a network of bubbles that sit on the surface of the water in a swimming pool. The air bubbles are chiefly responsible for capturing and transmitting solar heat down to the depths of the pool. They also act as tiny prisms that collect sunlight and spread it across the surface of the water. This ensures an even distribution of thermal energy. Furthermore, the bubbles insulate the water from the cooler air blowing above the pool.","Since the convective cooling resulting from such air-to-water contact is responsible for most of the heat loss that happens in a pool, the bubbles effectively trap the thermal energy from sunlight in the pool. This passive solar heating significantly blocks the evaporation of water and pool chemicals and reduces the cost of heating your pool with fossil fuel or electricity. This heat retention makes it possible to swim in warm water at night and on cloudy days.","While the Standard Blue Solar Cover can raise the temperature of the water in your pool by 15 percent, its effectiveness is considerably diminished by its blue color. A blue pool cover gives pool water the soothing and beautiful aquamarine color that homeowners like. However, it also does not completely transmit the full spectrum of incident sunlight like clear solar blankets do. A clear solar blanket that effectively captures heat is the <a href=\"/best-solar-pool-covers\">Blue Wave Magni-Clear</a> solar blanket, which can increase water temperature by 10 to 15 degrees. Yet another flaw of the Standard Blue Solar Cover is its lack of a UV-protective film. This significantly affects its durability as ultraviolet rays split the seams of the blanket and shrink its bubbles.","The Standard Blue Solar Cover is a basic, lightweight pool blanket that can help keep your pool warm. However, it is small, is thin and has no UV protection."]},"id":"758b8254-5d7b-4cbe-9f92-70fc525e3da9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63268","url":"/solarcovers-com-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T20:26:41Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T20:26:41Z","name":"SolarCovers.com Standard Blue 12 ft.
