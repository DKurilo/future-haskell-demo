Firstly, it’s not a traditional ancestry test, it’s more of a surface-level examination of several traits. Ancestry is included, but if you’re looking for an in-depth analysis of your geographical heritage, look elsewhere. Though I found my percentage breakdowns with DNAPassport were similar to my results for FamilyTreeDNA and AncestryDNA, this service does not show your data on any sort of graphic. On the landing page, it shows you a map with colored dots to indicate where your DNA is from, but when you go to the actual Ancestry tab, it’s a simple pie chart. My DNA was broken down into 83 percent East Asia, 13 percent South/East Asia and four percent Other. It’s nowhere near as specific as <a href=\"/23andme-review\">23andMe’s</a> results, though it seems generally accurate, and is very vague.","The Humancode service advertises more than 40 traits spread across the areas of ancestry, wellness, personality and appearance. Besides ancestry, DNAPassport also presents insights on your hair and eye color, height, taste preferences, sleep style, caffeine metabolism and many other things. It doesn’t explain these insights, though, even when you click the “Learn More” tab.","More than anything, the DNAPassport results made testers more curious about their DNA instead of satiating curiosity. It’s like a starter kit for DNA exploration, which makes sense when you consider that it’s part of the Helix marketplace. Helix’s business model revolves around the idea of selling multiple DNA services with a single test. <a href=\"/services/home/best-dna-testing-kits/geno-2.0-review/\">National Geographic’s Geno 2.0</a> test is also part of the marketplace, and there are several diet and exercise tests, a DNA/wine pairing kit and the Mayo Clinic GeneGuide.","Overall, the DNAPassport by Humancode is more of an introductory version of 23andMe’s Health + Ancestry kit. It’s much cheaper, but its variety of insights and even its web design feel a little reminiscent. Its low price, however, comes with noticeable shortcomings. Mainly, it only grazes the surface when it comes to genetic insights. It’s a fun test if you’re looking for an inexpensive extra and you’re already part of the Helix marketplace, but on its own, it doesn’t provide enough data."]},"id":"02083b98-2484-4efb-ba17-4fef5e6002f3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70305","url":"/dna-passport-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-10-22T14:31:24Z","datePublished":"2018-10-22T14:31:24Z","name":"DNA Passport","synopsis":"DNAPassport by Humancode is entertaining, but it’s nowhere near as informative as our top DNA test kits.","review":{"rating":70,"verdict":"DNAPassport by Humancode is an entertaining DNA starter kit with opportunities for upgrades, but it isn&#8217;t worthwhile by itself.
