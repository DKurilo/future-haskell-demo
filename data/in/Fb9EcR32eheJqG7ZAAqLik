You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you whip up cookies often, the KitchenAid 7-Cup KFP0722ER <a href=\"/best-food-processors\">food processor</a> may be a good addition to your kitchen. It’s easy to use and easy to clean, and it makes dough preparation a simple, speedy task.","In our tests, this model did a good job mixing dry ingredients, eggs and softened butter to make cookie dough. We had to turn it up to the high setting at the end to incorporate the small amounts of flour that didn’t get mixed into the dough at lower settings, but that worked fine. The result was a nicely mixed, pliable dough that was ready to bake into cookies.","This KitchenAid model created beautifully even, almost symmetrical slices of raw potatoes, so if you make scalloped or au gratin potatoes, this is one of the best food processors. It also chopped onions fairly well – they were a reasonably consistent texture and good enough for cooking. However, they weren’t chopped precisely enough to sprinkle on top of tacos. The machine did a good job shredding cheddar cheese, too, although there were a few wasted chunks stuck on top of the blade.","However, we encountered some less impressive results in other tests we put this KitchenAid food processor through. When we pulsed raw spinach, the resulting pieces had an uneven texture, and there were some big leaves remaining at the bottom of the processor. We also got mixed results and uneven pieces when we chopped raw mushrooms. These flaws are drawbacks if you need evenly cut veggies for a dish to cook evenly or if you like your food to be aesthetically pleasing, though it doesn’t matter much if you mostly chop ingredients for soups and stews.","Unfortunately, this food processor simply could not grate Parmesan cheese, and it also failed to puree cauliflower with a bit of water added. We also had little luck chopping almonds: They were not uniform, and we found big chunks of almond amid some dust-like ground almond meal. When we tested with liquid, the machine leaked a bit on the high speed setting but very little on the low speed.","This was the quietest food processor we tested – and these machines aren’t known for being especially quiet. On its high setting, it emitted a reasonable 72.8 decibels, which is comparable to the average vacuum cleaner. Also, with three speeds and oversized buttons, the machine is easy to control. The KitchenAid 7-Cup food processor was a snap to clean by hand, and you can pop its parts onto the top rack in the dishwasher for more thorough washing."]},"id":"58b8edf6-5a4b-4b5e-854e-882cbf00c958","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bf73786b-2102-4ab6-b189-0a4590a453f3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the KitchenAid 7-Cup food processor does a good job slicing, shredding and kneading most foods, but it does not puree that well and failed to grate hard cheese.
