The Roundabout convertible car seat continues that trend of high quality. This basic <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> will stay with your baby until he is 2 or 3 years old, converting from an infant&#39;s rear-facing car seat to a toddler&#39;s front-facing seat with little hassle. However, this seat lacks many convenience features that we look for.","Like all retail car seats in the U.S., the Britax Roundabout is fully certified for crash safety. That means it meets federal requirements and will keep your child safe and secure in most situations. While the seat is easy to install in either its rear- or front-facing position, it lacks level indicators to tell you how much recline your child should have.","The Britax Roundabout will act as a rear-facing car seat for children up to 40 pounds and as little as 5 pounds. While this range isn&#39;t low enough for premature babies, it will keep other babies secure for close to two years. Then, when the baby outgrows the rear-facing position, you can turn the convertible car seat into a front-facing seat able to protect a child up to 55 pounds.","Like all convertible car seats, the Roundabout is a stay-in-car seat that is not compatible with any Britax strollers or high chairs. It has an adjustable harness, but it&#39;s not as easy to use as other car seats we reviewed. Also, its cushions are not machine washable, so you&#39;ll have to clean everything by hand. It does not have a canopy for your infant, which means you&#39;ll have to find an alternate way to shield your baby from the sun. Lastly, you can order an optional cup holder and storage pouch for drinks, snacks or toys.","Britax offers a one-year warranty for the Roundabout, and you can download a new instruction manual online. There is a local retailer search function on the Britax website, so you&#39;ll be able to check your stores to buy the car seat. If you need personal help, customer service is available by phone and email, and we were able to get an email response within a day of sending out questions."]},"id":"65bc0799-aed4-4710-ac55-9296eb0279a4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b7b8140d-ff10-4b4c-8f61-252c4d140f76","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Britax Roundabout is a basic baby car seat that will keep your baby safe and secure for two to three years.
