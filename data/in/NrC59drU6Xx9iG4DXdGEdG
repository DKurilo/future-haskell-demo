Double layer Blu-ray discs can hold about 50 GB equaling about four and a half hours of high definition information or 26 hours in standard definition.

Blue laser wavelengths are shorter than the red at 405nm and are about two and a half times smaller in diameter than red lasers.

This allows the Blu-ray disc to squeeze almost five times as many grooves on to a disc exactly the same size as a DVD. Blu-ray also includes a protective layer to prevent scratches. This protective layer is physically thinner than the one on a DVD, but it has a hard coating that makes it more scratch resistant."],"type":"ul"},"id":"7b70faae-eedd-4d96-9981-a9bfb912c6c2","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Image Resolution</strong><br/>Image resolution is measured by the number of vertical lines times the number of horizontal lines of light in a picture.

Although a DVD can store high definition data it would only fit about 30 minutes maximum.","Blu-ray- Blu-ray was designed for high definition 1080 display. Since they can store 25 GB of data you can fit an entire HD movie on a single layer disc. Blu-ray currently has the best image resolution on the market and looks great on HDTVs.
