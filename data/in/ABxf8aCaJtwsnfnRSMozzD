The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 </em><a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\"><em>Home Theater Speakers here</em></a><em>.</em>","The HT-S5800 is Onkyo&#39;s mid-grade home theater in a box system. Despite being the little brother to the HT-S7700, this lower-priced Onkyo home theater is still an excellent choice. The S5800 provides you with an immersive sound, and its receiver has all the inputs and connectivity options you could ask for. ","The S5800 system includes six speakers – a center speaker, two front stereo speakers, two surround speakers and a subwoofer. The speakers have the same 130-watt input power as the S7700. The main difference between the two systems is their receiver, but we&#39;ll cover that later.","The S5800 supports Dolby&#39;s Atmos technology. Atmos provides multidimensional audio to your home theater system through upward firing speakers. The S5800&#39;s front speakers bounce sound off your ceiling to create realistic effects. This extra dimension really helps immerse you in whatever you&#39;re watching. It&#39;s especially stimulating with nature documentaries.","This home theater speaker system includes multiple listening modes whether you&#39;re gaming, listening to music, watching sports or a movie. Depending on what you&#39;re watching, there&#39;s more than likely a setting to ensure you have the highest-quality audio. For instance, there is a separate mode for role-playing games since they tend to be more orchestra heavy.","Without a doubt, Onkyo prioritizes audio performance for movie watching. This isn&#39;t to say that you shouldn&#39;t or can&#39;t use the speakers for listening to music, but the surround sound is just fantastic for all sorts of movies. The subwoofer for this system provides deep and bellowing bass. It weighs 21 pounds and has a 10-inch driver. The bass can almost be too overwhelming, which can potentially be a problem if you live in an apartment.","Onkyo includes its HT-R494 receiver with the S5800 system. It supports the latest HDMI specifications, HDCP 2.2 and has the ability to transfer 4k video at 60 frames per second without deterioration. Where it is lacking, compared to the S7700, is its connectivity options. It has four HDMI inputs and a single HDMI output. It still has older connection standards like Digital Audio and Optical; you get two inputs for the former and a single one for the latter.","The 7.1-channel receiver is rated at 115 watts per channel. It lacks a disc player, but you should have plenty of inputs to plug in a Blu-ray player or video game console. It even has a USB port for powering your MP3 player or streaming devices. There&#39;s an AUX jack where you can plug in any 3.5-mm, male-to-male cable for wired audio connections. Another advantage to this receiver is you can use it with speakers you already have or plan to buy in the future. ","This receiver has Bluetooth but lacks Wi-Fi and an Ethernet jack, so you won&#39;t be able to use it for streaming services like Spotify, Netflix and Pandora. But an FM tuner is onboard for listening to the radio.","Setup for the S5800 home theater sound system is quite simple since Onkyo color-coded its speaker cables to match the back of the speakers and the receiver. There are also several instruction manuals. However, if you need some extra support to walk you through the setup process, there are multiple contact options available to reach Onkyo, with the exception of live chat. The company has telephone, email and social media support channels. Onkyo can also repair your system as long as you are within the two-year warranty period. This coverage includes the cost for parts and labor.","Onkyo&#39;s HT-S5800 is one of the best home theater in a box systems available. Its speakers provide you with full sound and with excellent bass response. The S5800 receiver isn&#39;t as strong and full of ports as Onkyo&#39;s other home theater in a box system, but it works well for most individuals, not to mention it has all the updated connectivity options like HDMI 2.0."]},"id":"7590b037-d704-4143-938b-07014084b71e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67342","url":"/onkyo-ht-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-10-29T23:24:27Z","datePublished":"2015-10-29T23:24:27Z","name":"Onkyo HT-S5800","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
