When combined into a single unit, these two technologies can keep you protected from different types of fires that may break out from a variety of sources.","This unit does not include a carbon monoxide (CO) detector; however, it should be noted that depending on the types of appliances you have in your home, you may not need one at all. CO detectors should be installed in homes with fuel-burning appliances, fireplaces or attached garages but may not be necessary in every room of your home. For optimal coverage against carbon monoxide, fast-burning fires and smoldering fires, we recommend installing a CO detector on every level of your home in addition to First Alert BRK 3120B units in every room. "]},"id":"66fedf68-e38e-4568-9aa7-009950520c7c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"4dc84132-248a-4c01-b0cc-d022f1620e29","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/Z7EBhG8eGYZowNfpJTgJpP.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/60782-brk-3120b6.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z7EBhG8eGYZowNfpJTgJpP.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Z7EBhG8eGYZowNfpJTgJpP","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z7EBhG8eGYZowNfpJTgJpP.jpg","alt":""},"id":"5d6920ae-0b1b-4433-aed6-c7ddc91f5845","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["A key benefit of this hardwired smoke alarm is that it connects to your home’s electrical system and only requires battery power in the event of a power outage. Battery backup is provided by two AA batteries. Since battery power is only used during power outages, this means you may achieve greater longevity from your batteries – although it is strongly recommended that you replace your batteries at least once every 12 months.","Unlike the vast majority of wireless smoke alarms, which operate independently of one another, the BRK 3120B can interconnect with as many as 18 other First Alert units, including smoke, CO and heat alarms. The maximum limit of First Alert smoke alarms it can interconnect with is 12. Interconnected smoke detectors cause all alarms to go off if only one of them is activated, which can better notify you to the presence of a hazard in your home. Interconnectivity is highly beneficial if you have smoke detectors installed in your basement, garage or closed-off back rooms that might make it difficult to hear if a single alarm were to sound off.","Because this smoke alarm is powered by your home’s electrical system, it may not work in older homes that have not been retrofitted for smoke detector connectivity. Before you purchase a smoke alarm, contact an electrician to explore your options and to see if you would be better off opting for battery-operated smoke alarms."]},"id":"8e3c3f51-6ac2-44a2-b3ad-082b0e54c896","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"1213e8dd-2236-4cb0-84e3-b6dab3f1cfc0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/Ykjo3iVXAcWABqTs9nBfx3.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/60782-brk-3120b8.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ykjo3iVXAcWABqTs9nBfx3.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Ykjo3iVXAcWABqTs9nBfx3","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ykjo3iVXAcWABqTs9nBfx3.jpg","alt":""},"id":"578d3327-d963-43ba-81f6-ef8a5e47ab9e","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The First Alert BRK 3120B includes standard features, including an alarm hush button that can be used to silence an alarm that’s been tripped.
