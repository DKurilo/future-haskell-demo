The motor, at 3 horsepower, is about average, and its performance in our tests reflected its lack of power. One standout feature is the length of the hose. At 10 feet, this shop vacuum has the longest hose reach of those we reviewed.","We tested all our vacuums with a mix of mulch and screws, and this shop vacuum had trouble picking up the debris. After the first pass, it was able to pick up only five of the six screws and about 60 percent of the mulch. For the wet cleanup test, it performed adequately, sucking up water at a speed of 4.68 gallons per second. At 94 dB, it was around the average volume of the best shop vacuums. If youâ€™re looking for even more cleaning, try the <a href=\"/ridgid-wd1450-review\">Ridgid WD1450</a>.","The vacuum is easy to move around and has nice locking wheels that can navigate different obstacles. Its hose, at a diameter of 1.25 inches, is smaller than those of our highest-rated models and likely contributed to its subpar outing in the mulch test. It does offer great overall length, however. The power cord reaches 10 feet, the hose adds another 10 feet, and the storage rack has three combinable extension wands.","The Shop-Vac stands out with its total number of attachments. Beyond the extension wands, the rack includes a floor nozzle, crevice tool and gulper nozzle for a total of six different attachments. They all lock tightly on the lid of the tank. The crevice tool works well for tight spaces, and it&#39;s also nice for using the blower function and spraying away loose leaves or sawdust.","This shop vacuum lacks a few things. The tank doesn&#39;t have a drain port for removing vacuumed water. The tank fills up quickly, which means you have to bend over and tip it each time it needs to be emptied. It uses both wet and dry filters, but it doesn&#39;t have a retainer for the one not in use."]},"id":"0bd063c4-0194-42df-950c-783fa57ef5f6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"919e334c-d2b4-463a-8edd-594c182df75d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the Shop-Vac 965-06-00 didn&#39;t perform well in our tests.
