The Honeywell HPA300 is an exception, as it has a manageable noise level, convenient side handles and a low-profile design. However, this air purification system lacks some key components, such as an auto mode, sleep mode and remote control. Overall, though, this machine can effectively remove indoor pollutants from your home, particularly dust particles.","This air purifier is one of the best at removing dust particles among all the models we reviewed. It also efficiently removes smoke particles, but it has more trouble capturing pollen than other air purifiers we reviewed. The HPA300 can effectively clean the air in rooms up to 465 square feet. In larger rooms than that, it starts to lose its effectiveness at removing airborne particles. This air cleaner is capable of making five air changes an hour, which means it pushes all the air in the room through the filters once every 12 minutes.","The three air-cleaning levels allow you to adjust the airflow through the filter. Unfortunately, this air purifier does not have an air-quality sensor or auto mode to adjust these three cleaning levels automatically. It does have an operation timer so that you can set it to run for two, four or eight hours. This unit also has a filter monitor to help you keep track of when to change filters. However, the HPA300 does not come with a remote control, which would be convenient for those times when you&#39;re sitting across the room and want to change the settings.","Honeywell offers good support options, including a short FAQs section that can answer your questions before you reach out to customer support. If you need more help, you can call or email Honeywell representatives. The company doesn&#39;t offer live chat support at this time. The HPA300 comes with a five-year warranty, which protects you against manufacturer defects."]},"id":"35a4b23e-517f-4f4f-b941-f5eb12bd18bf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6567c21f-d175-4288-8d2b-17e2de38c0fc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Honeywell HPA300 is a decent air purifier that can effectively remove dust and smoke from your home without much issue.
