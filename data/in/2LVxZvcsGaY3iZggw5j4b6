You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Onkyo is known for making high-quality <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theaters in a box</a> that are offered at surprisingly low prices. The Onkyo HT-S7200<strong> </strong>is no exception. It is a variation of the Onkyo HT-S5100 and Onkyo HT-S5200, which are two very well-received and highly rated home theater systems. Like the others, the Onkyo HT-S7200 features a 7.1-channel system and amazing sound quality. The Onkyo HT-S7200 differs from the other models in that it boasts a few extra perks. Overall, it is yet another excellent buy from Onkyo for many reasons.","The Onkyo HT-S7200 is a 7.1-channel system offered at a moderate price point. This is a big deal because almost all 7.1-channel systems are high-end theater systems with higher prices. Moderately priced home theaters in a box, which the Onkyo HT-S7200 certainly is, are typically only 5.1-channel systems.","The higher the number of channels, the better because it is possibly the single biggest factor in determining your entertainment experience. The number 7.1 means that there are seven surround speakers and one subwoofer, and the more speakers you have strategically placed in your space, the better your surround-sound quality. Moderately priced home theaters usually only come with five satellite speakers and one subwoofer.","The sound quality of the Onkyo HT-S7200 lives up to the excellent reputation Onkyo has made for itself regarding this selling point. Independent testers and the most discriminating audiophiles agree that the Onkyo HT-S7200&#39;s sound quality is beautifully pure and that there is no distortion, even at the highest volume levels.","This home theater system includes Audyssey&#39;s 2EQ automatic calibration system, which equalizes and autocorrects the speakers for optimal sound output. The HT-S7200 also includes Audyssey sound technology to even out sound levels between the program or movie you&#39;re viewing and overly loud commercials. The Onkyo HT-S7200 has Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio – the highest quality and most preferred audio format. The HT-S7200 again delivers high-end sound quality at a moderate price.","The Onkyo HT-S7200 also has all the features and connectivity options you could possibly want, and more of them than similar Onkyo models. The HT-S7200 has the most HDMI connections of any of the Onkyo&#39;s home theaters in a box, with a whopping five HDMI inputs. The HT-S7200 also has the ability to upconvert analog video to a 1080i HD resolution. If you have old home movies on VHS tapes, you can convert them into HD DVDs, which is a useful tool for many people. The HT-S7200 also contains a full component grade AV receiver and an iPod dock.","There are only a couple possible downsides to the HT-S7200. Reviewers report that the upconverted HD video quality of analog footage is subpar. Also, the design of the home theater in a box is large and somewhat bulky. While the 10-inch, 290-watt subwoofer is very powerful, it weighs more than 25 pounds and measures 10.8 inches by 19.9 inches by 16.2 inches. This is a big box that takes up a lot of space, and the seven satellite speakers are also large and boxy. This means that if you have a small entertainment space, the HT-S7200 may not fit well.<strong><br/></strong>"]},"id":"338b1781-75c6-454d-81db-079c7deda855","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"73047cf3-9af3-4d27-b094-ee68b40ac20b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HT-S7200 has great sound and a full 7.1-channel surround-sound system in addition to all the connections you could want.
