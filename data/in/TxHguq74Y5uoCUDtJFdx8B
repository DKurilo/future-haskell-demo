This is HP’s lowest priced color laser multifunction printer with faxing capabilities.","The HP Color LaserJet is no lightweight. It tips the scales at 54.5 pounds. It stands just over 19 inches tall and 19 inches wide. While this <a href=\"/best-all-in-one-printers\">all in one printer</a> isn’t exactly a compact printer, it does offer a nice set of features for its size.","<strong>Standout Features</strong>","•\tPrint speeds up to 8 PPM in color and 12 PPM in black<br/>•\t600 dpi Output<br/>•\tBuilt-in Networking<br/>•\tMemory Card Reader","<strong>Features</strong>","The HP CM1312nfi can help increase your efficiency with printing speeds of up to 8 pages per minute in color and up to 12 pages per minute in black. The instant on technology means that the printer is ready when you are. You won’t have to spend time waiting for it to warm up.","With its capability to print 600 dpi you can print high quality documents and photos. The high resolution also allows better document reproduction so the copies look as good as the originals.","The built-in networking allows this printer to be shared across a network. The large 125 page output bin is large enough to handle just about any print job you can throw at it. It can also handle up to 50 pages in its document feeder. Just load your documents and forget about it.","The 2.4 inch color LCD screen lets you see what you are about to print. You can make sure that you are about to print the correct photo. It will also display the job status for any current job. The LCD screen has the ability to tilt to make it easier to read. Perfect if the printer is at your desk and you need to read it without standing up.","<strong>Summary of Reviews</strong>","Expert reviewers were pleased with the performance of the CM1312nfi. The print quality was superb for both photos and text. The larger paper feed trays helped to reduce time wasted when the printer runs out of paper. The fax machine also worked better than the competition.","Users liked the picture quality just like the experts. The built in features are just about everything that a small business user or home office user could want. Some users noted that while photos came out looking good, it was apparent it wasn’t a photo printer. The text and graphs came out vivid and crisp, good enough to print your own marketing materials.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The HP Color LaserJet CM1312nfi has plenty of features and would be a great addition to anyone’s home or office.<br/> "]},"id":"dda6d181-7e81-4481-88ae-bc5110561136","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_24575","url":"/hewlett-packard-cc431aaba-21937-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-02-06T07:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-02-06T07:00:00Z","name":"HP Color LaserJet CM1312NFI CC431A#ABA","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":47,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-02-06T21:10:38Z","id":"TxHguq74Y5uoCUDtJFdx8B","meta":{"title":"HP Color LaserJet CM1312NFI Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
