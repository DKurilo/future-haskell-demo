The fans work really well keeping your laptop cool, but they are unprotected and quite vulnerable to damage. Your laptop runs a much lower risk of overheating when all three fans are up and running properly. It is a quiet laptop cooling pad. It will be unobtrusive to any of your workflow. <br/>This laptop does have an included USB cord, but it doesn&#39;t have any extra USB ports or USB cord storage. Those are really nice features to have and we wish we had seen them on this notebook cooler.","This cooler does have a great grip on your laptop. You won&#39;t have any troubles with your laptop slipping and falling. It also has a great surface grip on the bottom for hard surfaces.","This laptop cooler is not designed to be used on your lap. It has four legs that lift the cooler to give the fans the breathing room they need to circulate air. There is a higher risk for the fans breaking when used on your lap or other soft surface. Plus, this laptop cooling pad isn&#39;t comfortable at all when it&#39;s on your lap because the feet sit awkwardly on your legs.","The fans and feet are held together with thin  plastic. The four feet can effectively hold most of a laptop&#39;s weight, so general use of the cooler shouldn&#39;t cause a problem. However,  if it&#39;s hit hard or not handled with care, it has a high potential of breaking. Because it&#39;s fragile, it is not the best traveling cooling pad. It&#39;s much better for staying in one place.","This laptop cooling pad doesn&#39;t have a warranty, and eForCity&#39;s customer support is not impressive. They don&#39;t have a phone number, user manuals, tutorials, or a live chat handy. There is an email address you can contact, and you&#39;ll find a FAQs page on the company website."]},"id":"8da3f1bf-b419-4745-a4e8-77ba252cf7e1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"937c76ff-9af6-41a2-8e4d-ff027e3c0301","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The eForCity laptop cooler has three fans that contribute to the cooling of your laptop.
