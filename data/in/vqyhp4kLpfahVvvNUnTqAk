Businesses with self-service fuel dispensers have more time to upgrade their machines, since Visa and MasterCard extended the EMV deadline to October 1, 2020. Replacing magnetic stripe card readers with EMV chip readers on these machines is expensive, but as more businesses adopt EMV technology, those that don&#39;t follow suit put themselves at greater risk for fraud.","<strong>Non-Compliant Machines Are Targets</strong>","While the substantial expense of upgrading machines with EMV-compliant card readers gives gas station and ATM industries a strong argument for the extended deadline, merchants with these machines now find themselves at greater risk for fraud. Because most retailers have upgraded to EMV-compliant card readers, hackers are looking to capitalize on the best targets of opportunity – self-service gas pumps and ATMs.","Thieves install low-profile skimmers – small electronic devices that read the magnetic stripe on credit and debit cards – on ATM and gas pump card readers. A pinhole camera in the device allows thieves to watch people inputting their four-digit PIN codes. ATMs and gas stations are already prime targets for skimming because clever thieves can install these devices quickly, either under the guise of doing a repair or simply when no one&#39;s watching. The payment processing industry&#39;s move to the EMV chip simply made these targets more valuable.","The rise in skimming attacks started well before the deadline. FICO Card Alert Services noticed a 564 percent increase in ATM skimming attacks from 2014 to 2015, with an estimated $2 billion in stolen funds. As the deadline nears and more businesses update to EMV, hackers are likely to increase their attacks on the machines that haven&#39;t been updated rather than go to the extra effort of finding a new scheme.","<strong>What Can You Do?</strong>","If you own an ATM or self-service gas pumps, you should protect yourself against skimming attacks. Even if you aren&#39;t yet liable for credit card fraud, you still stand to lose consumer trust, and you still have to deal with the hassle and expense of fixing the problem. Here are three things you can do to protect yourself."]},"id":"22cbeb90-2683-4fbf-95a0-e2c5309205f8","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Get started early.</strong> Just because the deadline isn&#39;t for another year doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t install the EMV chip technology now. Consult with your payment processor about what you need to do to upgrade your machines with EMV-compliant card readers. If your contract is expiring soon, and your current credit card processing company is dragging its feet, you might take this opportunity to <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">find a new one</a>. Another advantage to upgrading early, especially for gas station owners, is that you&#39;ll avoid the rush to have your pumps re-inspected once the deadline hits.","<strong>Protect your equipment. </strong>If you&#39;re not yet ready to upgrade, there are some simple things you can do to protect your equipment. If possible, move the ATM machine where your cashiers can keep an eye on it. Use security tape on gas pumps so that a thief would have to cut or remove the tape in order to install their device. Quickly shut down pumps or ATMs that are suspect and have the machine checked for skimmers. Even a small sign reminding patrons to shield their hands when putting in their codes can help. (Hint: Your patrons need to protect their code from cameras that might be installed above the keypad rather than from the guy standing behind them.)","<strong>Stay vigilant. </strong>Train employees to watch for signs that indicate that your ATM or gas pump has been tampered with or that a skimmer has been installed, and how to look for pinhole cameras. Make it a shift-change procedure to inspect the ATM or pumps, and have employees make a show of checking these devices. Sometimes the demonstration of vigilance is enough to take you off a hacker&#39;s target list."],"type":"ul"},"id":"9c154df6-d5f6-4495-abe0-9e747c161bff","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Soon, most merchants in the U.S., including those with ATMs and self-service fuel pumps, will be using EMV-chip technology.

Although the expense of upgrading your ATM machines and fuel pumps with EMV technology is considerable, delaying makes your business vulnerable to hackers."]},"id":"80d6dfc6-2053-4e4e-b8a4-c207c1e9f90e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10091","url":"/emv-liability-for-fuel-pumps-and-atms-the-risks-and-what-to-do","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-21T20:04:07Z","datePublished":"2016-09-21T20:04:07Z","name":"EMV Liability for Fuel Pumps and ATMs: The Risks and What to Do","synopsis":"Delaying EMV Upgrade Increases Risk of Fraud at ATMs & Gas Pumps\nAfter October 1, 2017, businesses that haven't upgraded their ATM machines with EMV-compliant card readers are liable for counterf","review":{},"strapline":"Delaying EMV Upgrade Increases Risk of Fraud at ATMs & Gas Pumps\nAfter October 1, 2017, businesses that haven't upgraded their ATM machines with EMV-compliant card readers are liable for counterf","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-12-02T20:02:19Z","id":"vqyhp4kLpfahVvvNUnTqAk","meta":{"title":"EMV Liability for Fuel Pumps and ATMs: The Risks and What to Do","description":"Merchants with ATMs and gas pumps have until October 2017 to update to EMV-compliant card readers.
