This evaporative humidifier, which is best used in rooms up to 500 square feet, uses about 2 gallons of water a day and features germ-fighting technology to ensure that the mist it disperses into your home is free from germs and dust.","This cool mist humidifier can offer many benefits when your loved ones are suffering from colds, flu or allergies. It is a good humidifier for a baby or if you have other young children in the home. The cool mist it produces is ideal with children in the house because there is no hot steam nor any hot water that could potentially scald your youngsters if the unit is accidentally tipped over. However, the best humidifiers, like the <a href=\"/boneco-review\">Boneco 7135</a>, still offer the option of warm mist if you want it, and you only get cool mist with this model.","Unlike an ultrasonic humidifier, which produces mist through a vibration process, this model is an evaporative humidifier. It operates by pushing air through a wick that sits in water. The wick is quite large and allows water to evaporate more efficiently than it would with smaller wicks. While this unit does not have a humidistat, it does have a self-regulating feature that adjusts its output automatically and gives you the maximum amount of humidity possible.","This humidifier is very quiet. On low or medium speed, it is practically silent. If you place it right next to your bed and put it on high speed, you may hear the sound of the fan running quietly. The white noise that this produces is still gentle enough that it may actually help you sleep more soundly.","Honeywell takes two steps to ensure that this humidifier only provides you with clean moisture. First, the HCM-350 uses ultraviolet light to kill any bacteria and viruses lurking in your water. Second, Honeywell treats the filter with an antimicrobial process to help prevent the growth of germs and fungus. Although you still have to clean your humidifier regularly and change the filters to maintain optimal performance, the filters are easy to replace, and good maintenance gives you peace of mind that you are not spreading the cold and flu bugs that may be circulating in your home&#39;s air.","Measuring over 18 inches long, this humidifier is bulkier than most. However, its design includes a shatterproof plastic body that is dishwasher-safe. This makes up for its slightly large size. It has a translucent strip down the side that allows you to see when the water is low, which is essential for this model, as it does not have an automatic shut-off feature. This missing safety feature means you have to be vigilant of when to turn the machine off manually, or it may overheat from running on an empty tank. It does have a built-in handle that makes it easy to lift and carry. One of its most useful conveniences is that the tank sits flat in your kitchen sink. The tank opening is also large, making it easy to fill quickly.","If you run into any difficulties, you can seek customer support from Honeywell via phone or email, and you can download the user manual on the website. Honeywell covers this model with a three-year warranty, which is longer than average."]},"id":"6d2fd9d6-721f-4293-8c28-d1f77e534263","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"62e42812-6cef-44f5-b25e-3665e4164417","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Honeywell HCM-350 is an ultra-quiet humidifier that provides soothing and clean moisture through its safe and cool mist.
