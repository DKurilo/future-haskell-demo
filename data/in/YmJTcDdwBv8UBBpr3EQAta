You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Sony BDP-S780 is an impressive <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">3D Blu-ray player</a> that not only plays great 3D movies such as &#34;Avatar&#34; and &#34;Alice in Wonderland,&#34; but it also streams high-definition content from a wealth of online sources. The picture quality is nearly unmatched by the competition.","It also offers high quality audio features for your music library, including multi-room streaming and Gracenote software that identifies your music and applies the appropriate meta data when connected to the internet."]},"id":"40c75fdd-7b8e-416a-9369-9389150d20e6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Video Features &amp; Performance"},"id":"0617f5c9-9cdf-4708-b728-b78cf63e7277","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The 3D capabilities of this machine are top of the line. Unfortunately, as with every 3D Blu-ray player we reviewed, the monitor you connect it to limits this technology. When purchasing the Sony BDP-S780, take care that you have a 3D-capable HDTV. All the 3D goodness found in Blu-ray discs and piped through this player is completely wasted if you don&#39;t have a monitor capable of displaying it.","All 3D Blu-ray players also play 2D content. That&#39;s just a given. However, very few players have the ability to convert 2D images into 3D. The Sony BDP-S780 is a device that can. We like this feature, although any image captured in 2D then converted to 3D always looks somewhat distorted. It&#39;s not the fault of this particular player but the method used by any device or filmmaker to achieve this result.","This 3D Blu-ray player is capable of playing HD content at a resolution of 1080p, which is to be expected. If it were anything less, it wouldn&#39;t really be HD and therefore wouldn&#39;t really be a Blu-ray player. Running a Blu-ray player without HD capabilities would be like a playing baseball without a bat, or a ball, or a baseball diamond.","What makes this 3D Blu-ray player stand out in the HD video world are two picture-enhancement features, namely the 16-bit video processing and the noise reduction. These features enhance the images, and when combined, they create a superior picture with crisper details and stunning clarity. When you&#39;re dealing with HD quality pictures to start with, that is not an insignificant feat."]},"id":"05a5ec02-cad3-49da-af5e-d15799802bea","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Performance"},"id":"afe21354-9bfc-4e26-8bba-138fbb297a2b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Blu-ray players are (currently) the pinnacle of home theater technology. Ten years ago you would not see a picture that was as high quality as a Blu-ray disc, even in a movie theater. Now they&#39;re commonplace in households around the civilized world.","However, those great pictures would largely go to waste without powerful, cinematic sound to go with them. To that end, Dolby, the same company that masters sound for most Hollywood films, created a number of audio standards to meet the needs of the home entertainment market. This Sony 3D Blu-ray player contains all the latest and legacy Dolby Digital sound technology built in. Therefore, no matter what device or monitor you connect it to, this player maximizes your audio hardware for great sound.","Another audio feature worth noting is this Sony 3D Blu-ray player&#39;s multi-room music feature. This is essentially the player&#39;s Party Streaming Mode. This player has the ability to connect to multiple devices wirelessly and pipe music to all the connected devices at the same time. This is particularly useful for parties that take place in more than one room. You can have the same music playing in the living room, kitchen and basement game room simultaneously. Heretofore this task was either impossible or required a great deal of wiring.","Lastly in the audio department for this Sony 3D Blu-ray player is the inclusion of the Gracenote Metadata Service. Gracenote is software that analyzes your music files to determine what songs they contain, then it compares those songs to their online database. If meta data for the songs exist, Gracenote automatically populates the files with the necessary data."]},"id":"a0942ed5-165c-470b-ab1f-ca7e2e1d17c1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity &amp; Design"},"id":"432c8db5-c0ec-486f-9201-e4bf9d5a9986","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sony is a behemoth in the home entertainment world, due in no small part to the vast amount of content and features available on its devices.

Apps include popular services such as Netflix and Pandora as well as more focused interests such as NPR and Crackle.","Another app worth mentioning is Sony’s remote control app. This app allows you to transform a mobile device such as an iPhone, iPad or Android smartphone into a remote control.
