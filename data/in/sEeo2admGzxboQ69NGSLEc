Many people buy Viper car alarms because of its brand. Having a Viper decal on your car&#39;s window is viewed by many to be an effective, albeit unproven, deterrent. (This explains why you can purchase the decals separately.) This car alarm is the most expensive car alarm at about $200, and this is not counting the cost of any additional sensors you may want to add. These can push the price over $500. Save for a few minor aesthetic details on the remote, it&#39;s identical to the <a href=\"/python-car-alarm-review\">Python 5706P</a>, though the latter is a bit cheaper.","The Viper 5706V&#39;s main selling point, however, is the LC3 two-way pager remote. With a mile range, it provides greater roaming capabilities than other car alarm remotes by a half mile. The LC3 makes it very easy to respond to alerts since it tells you exactly what is happening to your car. For example, if the car door opens, the remote beeps and the screen reads “Door Open.” If the alarm goes off, the LC3 beeps and tells you. You don&#39;t have to wonder whether the car alarm you hear is coming from your car.","The Viper 5706V’s Responder LC3 remote is intuitive and recharges using any USB port. You never have to worry about buying new batteries, and the battery life is extremely long, lasting months before you need to recharge. The product also comes with a spare remote in case you accidently lose or break the first.","While not technically a security feature, remote start is one of the primary reasons to purchase the Viper 5706V. Using the remote, you can start your car minutes before you leave so the internal temperature can adjust to your liking. This is a fantastic convenience to have on exceptionally cold or hot days, as long as you don’t mind letting your car idle. You no longer have to get into a freezing cold car in the winter or a scorching hot car in the summer. The remote also serves as a keyless entry and a trunk opener.","One of the reasons the Viper 5706V is one of the best car alarms is it’s compatible with Viper SmartStart products. The SmartStart system module plugs into your car’s electrical wiring so you can control it with an app on your smartphone. The module connects to the internet with a cellular connection, allowing you to use your smartphone as a remote from anywhere with a cellular connection. The SmartStart GPS module adds tracking capability – if someone steals your car, you can track it down with the app. The one downside to SmartStart is the monthly subscription fee, a standard requirement to connect to a cellular network.","The Viper 5706V car alarm provides comprehensive alerts and has a remote with a range up to 1 mile. The remote-start feature provides a level of convenience other car alarms can’t match. When paired with the SmartStart modules, this auto security system can give you exceptional peace of mind."]},"id":"08990935-0af5-4078-ae20-cb8ab70fe1df","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69146","url":"/viper-5706v-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-03-16T17:21:07Z","datePublished":"2017-03-16T17:21:07Z","name":"Viper 5706V","synopsis":"The Viper 5706V is the most high-end car alarm on the market.
