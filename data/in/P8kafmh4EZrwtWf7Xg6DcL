Keeping everything in your head – or on the back of a napkin – risks confusion and loss of focus. Business plan software, such as <a href=\"#Business_Plan_Pro\">Business Plan Pro</a> and <a href=\"#Business_PlanMaker\">Business PlanMaker</a>, helps you organize goals and plans for your startup.","Business plans not only help you prepare for startup; they also help your company stay on track through first months and years. Most experts recommend updating your business plan on a regular basis, especially if you use it to entice investors or partners. Software can assist you in creating and maintaining a variety of plans, from general business plans to marketing plans. You can find more information on these products as part of our <a href=\"/money\">business plan articles</a>.","<strong>DIY Business Plans: What to Look For</strong>","Business plan software includes options such simple fill-in-the-blank templates or legal programs that help you navigate incorporation and contract development. Selecting the right plan lets you create a business plan most likely to help you succeed.","<strong>Templates &amp; Sample Documents</strong><br/>One of the most important aspects of software for business planning is the inclusion of sample documents and templates. Sample documents provide you with an idea of correct business plan formats, so you know what type of information to gather before getting started. Templates provide the bones of a document, allowing you to enter information without typing the entire plan from start to finish.","<strong>Support of Multiple Plan Types</strong><br/>Some software is designed for a specific industry or business; others provide information and templates for creating general plans that work in a variety of arenas. The most robust programs let you select from common industries and may even include options for start-up, investor or marketing business plans. When opening a niche business, such as a coffee shop, look for software that meets industry needs. Otherwise, select general or all-inclusive products.","<strong>Technical Support</strong><br/>DIY business plan products are generally designed to be user-friendly and walk you through the business planning process, but you may run into technical issues as you download, install or use the program. Free tech support options help ensure you get optimal benefits from your purchase. Look for products that come with at least two tech support options, including email, forums, telephone or online chat support.","<strong>Software Specifications</strong><br/>As with any software, you&#39;ll need to ensure the business planning product you purchase will work on your computer. Take a few minutes to compare the software requirements, such as memory and operating system, with your computer. If you plan to use the product to co-create a plan with another person or team, you may need to purchase multiple licenses or opt for a cloud-based version with multiple logins.","Business planning tools let you start organized and in control. Using the right tools throughout your company&#39;s early years can help you stay in control for increased chances of success.","<strong>Business Plan Pro Review</strong>"]},"id":"2d20b575-0395-424c-ba82-b0893b41f8e4","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/y92SBPR7tbpi6WZodPe2n8.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Knowledgeable guidance is always helpful when you&#39;re starting your own business, and software that walks you through the planning process is one way to receive such guidance.

The software includes more than 2,000 sample documents, including 500 complete business plans that you can edit for your own use or use for inspiration. While so many templates could be overwhelming, Business Plan Pro provides a browser that lets you filter plans by business category or keywords.","One of the fears many small business owners have when writing a business plan is messing up the accounting or math—you certainly don&#39;t want to be presenting a document to potential investors and have someone point out a math error. Business Plan Pro helps you get around that problem by handing calculations in the software. While you do have to take care to enter your numbers correctly, some basic validations and table wizards help you enter accurate information. The program then uses your data to forecast growth and financial health over time, something investors like to see in any business pitch.","Business plan format is important, but so is a professional presentation. Business Plan Pro lets you export information to preformatted Word, Excel, PowerPoint or PDF files; print booklets or use projectors to share your data with investors. If you want something less generic than the preformatted document, you can use Business Plan Pro for limited customization on each page of your document before exporting.","One ongoing benefit of Business Plan Pro is that the business plan software is set up for more than just seeking investors. The tool also offers cash flow tools, follow-up plans and a management dashboard, but you&#39;ll have to purchase the Premier edition to take advantage of these options. Business Plan Pro does recommend the Premier edition for entrepreneurs who plan on seeking multiple outside funding sources.","As a business planning tool, Business Plan Pro is comprehensive and easy to use.

One component of Business PlanMaker that is helpful for entrepreneurs seeking funding is the error review at the end of the document-creation process. The software runs a basic check to ensure no essential sections are missing and notifies you of possible errors in the plan.","Once your plan is complete, Business PlanMaker prompts you to publish in a variety of formats so you can meet the preferences of different types of investors. The business plan software lets you print or email the document, or you can export pieces to Word or Excel for further customization. Sharing through email or the web via a Word document can get dicey if investors don&#39;t have a compatible version, so you can also export your entire presentation as a PDF.","Making your DIY business plan ready for publication through Business PlanMaker involves working through an interview-style process during which the software instructs you on what data is needed for each component of the plan. While individuals familiar with business planning may find the process cumbersome, the wizard does make it easier for new business owners to create an accurate document. The interview wizard also offers advice and tips helpful for new or intermediate business plan writers.","Instead of providing a business plan format where you fill in the blanks, Business PlanMaker converts your answers into a complete document. While this might lead to limitations, the fact that you can export the document to Word for customization mitigates any worry about being tied to specific wording.","Along with the software, you get access to a library for entrepreneurs that offers advice regarding business structures, industry trends and additional resources for launching a start-up. Business PlanMaker is a good option for anyone who hasn&#39;t ever written a business plan.

If you know how to write a basic business plan, then the colorful graphs enhance your data and capture the interest of investors.","Business Suite offers two other planning tools: a calendar and invoice template. The invoice template lets you generate Excel invoices from information you previously entered. Convert the invoices to PDF or other documents for emailing, or print and send batch invoices easily. Use the calendar tool to schedule invoicing as well as other events. When launching a new business, your schedule can become dense with meetings and new company needs, so any organization assistance can be helpful. You can use the calendar to manage yearly, monthly, weekly or daily views. A single click lets you see what&#39;s on tap for the day, and you can back out to see major milestone plans for your business throughout the year.","Business Suite provides planning tools for business owners, some of which may be helpful in writing your business, marketing or investing plans.
