Sunpentown SU-4010 ultrasonic <a href=\"/best-humidifiers\">humidifier</a> moisturizes air effectively and operates quietly enough not to be annoying or interrupt your sleep. It outputs approximately 2.5 gallons of water every 24 hours and is best for rooms up to 500 square feet in size. While you get high moisture output with it, you do not get a built-in humidistat to measure the actual humidity level you are reaching in the atmosphere of a particular room.","The humidifier runs for an impressive 12 hours on the cool mist setting. You get slightly less operational time, around 10 hours, if you use it as a warm mist humidifier, but that option is still helpful, as anyone who has experienced uncomfortable congestion from illness can attest. You need to refill the 1.1-gallon tank when either of these intervals ends or, naturally, if the water tank runs dry.","Coupled with a nearly silent operation, this long running time makes the SU-4010 ideal for moisturizing the air while you are resting or sleeping. The cool mist setting makes it a good humidifier for a baby, since pediatricians recommend cool-mist humidification for youngsters. Hot mist can burn children if they get too close, and the heated water inside the unit is always a safety hazard if it tips over. For adults, warm mist is ideal to help warm the air in a cold room, but both settings are equally effective at creating comfortable, moist air.","This is an ultrasonic humidifier, so it uses vibration to transform water into a fine mist. Water containing a high level of impurities not only shortens a humidifier&#39;s operating life but can also leave behind a fine white dust on your furniture when the mist evaporates. The answer to both of these issues, which are typical of ultrasonic humidifiers, is to use and replace the filter according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. If you know your water is hard, you may want to replace the filters more often. Fortunately, Sunpentown includes a replaceable filter with the SU-4010 to prevent minerals such as calcium and magnesium from building up inside it and recommends you purchase a replacement every six months.","However, these replacements are costlier than most. A feature this model shares with the best humidifiers is an automatic shut-off function. If this humidifier runs out of water while it operates, it simply turns itself off. This saves electricity and protects the unit&#39;s moving parts from overheating, reducing the potential for a fire.","One of the outstanding features of the Sunpentown SU-4010 is its long, thin design. This makes a big difference if you have limited space. At just over 5 inches wide, this unit fits into many places that are simply too small for other humidifiers.","Despite the unit&#39;s narrow size, the tank holds over a gallon of water, which is plenty to keep the humidifier running for a long time. When you need to refill the clear tank, it separates easily from the base and, with the built-in handle, is easy to transport to the sink.","This humidifier includes a one-year warranty, which is considerably shorter than the warranties you can find on top models from Boneco, <a href=\"/pureguardian-review\">PureGuardian</a> and Vornado. Should you run into problems, you can call a toll-free number on the manufacturer&#39;s website. In addition, you can send an email to the manufacturer. There is also a product manual on the company&#39;s website in case you lose the hard copy that comes with the unit."]},"id":"527b2abc-3dc8-4619-b236-55ab57b6a8eb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"097c094f-1475-4016-a4a1-9e6ea0c49875","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sunpentown SU-4010 has attractive, slim lines that allow it to fit conveniently into small spaces.
