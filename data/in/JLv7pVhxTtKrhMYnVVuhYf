This smart pen uses Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and USB so you have an array of ways to transfer your content across devices.","The Neo1 only works with Android and Windows operating systems, though. There is no iOS app for this pen. However, you can still transfer your notes to your iPhone using the nNote application on your computer. The pen easily connects with your computer or Android device and will simultaneously transfer your creations while you are sketching. If you aren&#39;t paired with your computer or phone, the pen has storage of its own, meaning your content can be transferred at a later time.","In order to use this digital pen, you must use a special dotted paper sold by NeoLAB Convergence. Notebooks will run you about $6. You can get a more affordable pad for $2.00, but it is just much smaller. Unlike other pens that require expensive specialty ink refills, these pens use standard ink cartridges.","The smart pen has a diameter of just 0.57 inches. It is almost 7 inches long, which is longer than most, and it weighs 1.2 ounces. The pen is comfortable to hold and easy to write with.","This pen is compatible with the desktop and mobile versions of the popular note-taking app EverNote. Or, if you want, you can just send PDF versions of your notes through text message or email. NeoLAB&#39;s nNote app also has sharing functionality built in for social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.","This electronic pen comes with a one-year warranty. NeoLAB Convergence doesn’t have phone support. They do list the addresses for their overseas offices, but it would quicker to reach them via email. You can also visit the company&#39;s website, where you will find a FAQs page, as well as gain access to tutorials and online forums."]},"id":"0ea49218-2929-4e5b-a4d2-f46416852dd5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9958d439-13fc-4559-9593-11d7f1cdfea2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Generally, Apple iPhone users tend to have an upper hand, usually getting software before an Android counterpart.
