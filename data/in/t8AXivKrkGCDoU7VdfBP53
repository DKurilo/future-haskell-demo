people look for a <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">portable DVD player</a> for road trips, while others need something that they can use in hotels or at Grandma’s house. The Maxmade MDP919 aims to be the latter. It is a compact DVD player with excellent video quality and a strong battery. Unfortunately, since it does not come with a DC power adapter or a car mount, it is not a good option for road trips. Still, its compact design makes it easy to use on the go.","The Maxmade has a lower resolution than many other DVD players, but when we tested a DVD we were familiar with, the picture looked clean and accurate. When we tested the viewing angle, we didn’t notice distortion until we were 45 degrees from center. This means that multiple people can watch the player without experiencing much distortion.","The built-in speakers are loud and clear. When we turned the volume all the way up, we were able to get a maximum loudness of 94 dB. The sounds were spot-on with what we were expecting to hear from our DVD. Next, we plugged in our test headphones. They reached a maximum loudness of 75 dB, which is plenty for headphones. However, the DVD sounded muted when compared to other players, and even when compared to the built-in speakers, the headphones seemed to be missing something.","Maxmade promises a battery that will last between two-and-a-half and four hours. After fully charging the battery and playing our test DVD on repeat, we were able to get just under four hours of play time. This is plenty for the longest movies, but if you’re going on a long trip, make sure to bring the wall adapter.","Unfortunately, because it lacks both a car headrest mount and a DC power adapter, this is not great for cars. While you can easily take it with you on vacations, you won’t like using it in your vehicle."]},"id":"3f8e48f6-056d-4221-9bce-f2cb01d52ea1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"074de14f-2cdd-41dd-b92f-9329ddc202ca","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maxmade MDP919 is a good vacation DVD player with remarkable video quality and a long battery life.
