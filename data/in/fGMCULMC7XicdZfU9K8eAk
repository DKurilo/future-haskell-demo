These devices have long been a staple of every office and workplace around the globe. As more companies work with <a href=\"/best-online-fax-services\">online fax services</a>, they eventually don&#39;t see the need for unnecessary fax machines. However, you&#39;d be surprised at how many businesses still rely on keeping their fax machines. While there are pros and cons of using this device, there are threatening factors that may affect your identity and personal information.","The main issue with using a fax machine is that a fax can be sent at any time of day, without your receiving any notification of its arrival. That means anyone could pick up a fax and see potentially private information, whether it&#39;s janitorial staff or nosy coworkers. The types of private information that usually require a signature and would be sent through a fax include contracts, loan documents and medical documents. To fight this, it&#39;s best to either use a private fax machine behind locked doors or use SSL-encrypted internet faxing."]},"id":"55c9ee2c-4b32-4a7f-9654-318fd3b81fa3","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Surprisingly, the biggest risks are literally hiding inside your fax machine. One day, your (or your company&#39;s) old, clunky fax machine will be tossed to the trash, recycled or even resold. Some devices, known as thermal transfer fax machines, typically used by small businesses, contain rolls of film or ink ribbon that record everything you&#39;ve ever faxed. Other fax machines often retain document memories as well.","In a report about this topic, CBS News noted, &#34;Nearly every digital copier since 2002 contains a hard drive   like the one on your personal computer   storing an image of every document copied, scanned or emailed by the machine.&#34; If you opened up a fax machine and removed the hard drive, you would find loads of information that is better left destroyed.","Something that you never knew existed may have your Social Security number, bank information, health records and personal correspondence all on one long thread of film. People are always looking for ways to protect their identity from being stolen online but may forget about the tangible ways to eliminate the risks they can control.","The surefire way to eliminate any potential risk is to properly inspect every major communication device you own before donating it or tossing it out. There are warehouses across America that house countless used fax machines and typically, they are sent overseas. The threat of anyone having access to your personal information should be enough motivation to erase a hard drive or destroy used film.","Fax machines are clearly still useful in millions of workplaces worldwide. They are great for small business and home use. However, there are identity risks in terms of fax machine use. The security provided by online faxing services is designed to cater to those who want to be notified every time a fax is sent and received and boasts password protection and SSL encryption."]},"id":"d538ba6f-ab55-41d1-9815-fb8d49b82e8b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8302","url":"/the-security-dangers-in-your-fax-machine","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"kent-dunn","url":"/author/kent-dunn","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Kent Dunn","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EXSnxY8W9sDDg36fM4idRa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-02-20T23:26:30Z","datePublished":"2014-02-20T23:26:30Z","name":"The Security Dangers in Your Fax Machine","synopsis":"The modern fax machine has celebrated a history with several decades of use.
