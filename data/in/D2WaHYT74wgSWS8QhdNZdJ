The base station, Nest Guard, controls the rest of the system while doubling as a keypad to arm and disarm the alarm. Nest Guard comes with an internal lithium-ion backup battery that lasts up to 12 hours on a charge. It also has a built-in motion detector and siren. When we tested the siren in the Nest Guard, it registered at 105 decibels, making it the loudest siren in our tests; Only <a href=\"/abode-review\">abode</a> matched this performance. Nest Tag is a small key fob that lets you wirelessly arm and disarm the alarm when placed near the Nest Guard.","Nest Guard connects to your home network via a Wi-Fi connection but also has a cellular radio. The cellular radio only works if you have a monitoring plan through Brinks. If you choose the no-contract option, the Brinks professional monitoring costs $29 a month, which is more expensive than most other monitoring plans for DIY security systems. There’s also a three-year contract option for $19 a month, which is a better value in the long term than the majority of security systems, DIY and professional alike.
