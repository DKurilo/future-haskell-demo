An evaporative humidifier works by forcing air through wet filters to produce cool mist. The filters need to be cleaned frequently or you ll see a build-up of bacteria and dirt. An ultrasonic humidifier works by vibrating a water-covered disk to make micro-fine moisture, which is then blown into the air. Ultrasonic humidifiers put everything that s in the water in the air. Unless you use a demineralization filter or cartridge, hard water may leave white dust on furnishings. You can also use purified drinking water or distilled water to help eliminate this extra dust.
