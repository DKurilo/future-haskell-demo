The rest of the sound quality is modest at best, however. A slender design and lightweight headband certainly help prevent headaches. Regrettably, there is nothing in the box except the headphones themselves – no remote, no mic, no storage case. So even though the quality of bass is relatively good, these <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">bass headphones</a> are definitely missing some key features.","Unlike other bass headphones, this set has open-back earcups. An open design lets air circulate between your ear and the speaker, which gives you heightened authenticity in sound quality. It also prevents the deep booming bass from really resonating, especially compared to the best headphones for bass. There are amble opportunities for sound to escape and sound to creep in from the outside. The large 70 mm driver compensates for the lack of sound isolation because it helps produce wider and more forceful bass. A low frequency range starting at 5Hz and a high sensitivity rating at 104dB also help produce that thunderous bass. Also, with these solid bass headphones, you never have to worry about draining the battery from your music device – an impedance of only 12ohms keeps your music pumping all day.","The feature set on the MDR-MA900s leaves much to be desired – neither remote nor microphone are provided. Since the headphones are open, they have no noise canceling capabilities either. And a storage case isn&#39;t even provided. The lack of features keeps this set from really being on par with the best bass headphones.","One great thing about these headphones is how much they weigh. At only 6.8 ounces, these are some of the very lightest bass headphones. The thin headband prevents the heavy and cumbersome pressure distinctive to other headphones with good bass. The MDR-MA900s unfortunately don&#39;t fold, making them harder to tote.","Sony offers pretty much everything when it comes to support. You can pick phone, email or live chat to connect with customer service representatives. If you have any questions, you can read FAQs and download product manuals at your leisure. Sony offers a one-year warranty instead of two, but product support, repair services, spare parts and other services are available at the click of a mouse."]},"id":"a924150c-f53d-45b3-9990-a9f1e6fc5f3f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"830eee1e-3d40-46d0-8c81-55798d6e11d1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Even with a lackluster list of features, these bass headphones still create a great sound.
