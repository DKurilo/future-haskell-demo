The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-home-automation-systems\">Home Automation Systems here</a>.</em>","In the world of home automation, quite a few devices don&#39;t fall into tidy systems. Revolv puts great effort to bring a variety of these proprietary devices together in a unified <a href=\"/best-home-automation-systems\">smart home system</a>. Revolv is easy to use, offers some good features and offers decent technical support. In contrast, Revolv currently supports only iOS smartphones and tablets, and it is not well suited to home security solutions, unlike most of the other products in our review.","Revolv&#39;s app has a minimalist design that makes it very easy to control your lights, thermostat and much more. The app gives you access to a few features that can be found in most smart house systems such as basic programs and scripted events. With these features, you can program the system to perform such tasks as adjusting the color of your LED lights, turning on your air conditioner or opening the garage door.","The Revolv system doesn&#39;t have a way to program random actions or connect with security system components other than motion detectors or locks. This means that you will need a separate system if you wish to add cameras, alarms or other security measures to your home, although such functionality may come with later Revolv updates. Since Revolv only works with iOS devices, you can use iTunes to play music on Sonos sound systems, but you cannot use Windows Media Player at this time.","Revolv comes with seven internal antennas that allow the hub to connect to only Insteon and Z-Wave devices. One exception to this is that Revolv does have a ZigBee antenna; however, the functionality of this hardware is not yet active but will be released in a future update. Revolv does not support KNX, UPB or X10 home control technologies. If you want to use a smart thermostat or HVAC system with Revolv, this home automation system supports some products by Honeywell, Nest and Trane. The software compatibility on the Revolv is dismal due its current singular compatibility with iOS devices especially since there is no support for Android or browser based remote access.","Revolv has a support structure in place that will help you solve problems, ask questions and even make requests for new features in future products. For direct assistance, you can use email, visit a user forum or call a telephone support number. If you prefer to find answers on your own, then you have access to a comprehensive FAQs section and intuitive tutorials on Revolv&#39;s support site. Revolv does not offer live chat support and does not require professional installation."]},"id":"2a6649b9-6c78-4022-b418-d51cbc2b606c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cb503fad-7464-4a5a-ab71-dbe7b534ce58","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Revolv is very much a work in progress.
