Sometimes all that is required is a simple, easy to use all-in-one unit. Curtis made the DVD5091 for just this purpose.","The Curtis DVD5091 features an all black chassis, a built-in DVD player, and 5.1 surround sound. The system is easy to set up since the DVD player is built right into the main unit.","<strong>Standout Features</strong>","•\t300 Watts Total Power<br/>•\t5.1 Channel Surround Sound<br/>•\tProgressive Scan","<strong>Features</strong>","The Curtis DVD5091 is rated at 300 watts total power. While this isn’t exactly room shaking power, it certainly sounds better than your typical TV speakers. The 300 watts are divided into 6 channels (5 speakers plus the subwoofer) which works out to be about 50 watts per channel.","With 5 speakers plus the included subwoofer, you can enjoy true surround sound from your movies. The built-in 5.1 Dolby Digital decoder channels the appropriate sounds to where they need to go, giving your movies new depth and realism.","Progressive scan essentially doubles the number of lines that are seen at any given time on the screen. Standard DVD players will only display odd or even lines at any given time while progressive scan will display both odd and even lines at the same time.","<strong>Summary of Reviews</strong>","The sound quality was adequate for what this system is. For less than $100 dollars, you actually do get a lot of sound. While it doesn’t sound nearly as crisp and precise as systems costing much more, it will sound better than most TV speakers.","Users were generally pleased with the Curtis DVD5091. The sound was better than that produced by a TV and the setup was simple and easy. The built-in DVD player made it easier to operate.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Curtis DVD5091 is a great choice for anyone looking to add surround sound to their TV without spending a fortune.<br/> "]},"id":"24de3bde-905d-4761-973b-b76965df7acc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_43247","url":"/curtis-international-44487-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-03-11T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-03-11T06:00:00Z","name":"Curtis DVD5091","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":11,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-03-11T15:21:57Z","id":"7aeKST8iTtqVNZkoQ2f5kj","meta":{"title":"Curtis DVD5091 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
