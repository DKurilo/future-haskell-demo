The battery lasts so long because the pedometer has a minimalist black-and-while screen that doesn’t require much power, especially when compared to more colorful interactive screens. The Go has what Withings calls an e-ink screen – it is always on and easy-to-see like an eReader screen. The screen itself has two modes you can tap between: clock and step goal. The clock mode shows what time it is, and the step goal mode shows how close you are to meeting your step goal for the day. For example, if your goal is 10,000 steps and you’ve only taken 7,500, the screen will show bars all the way from 12:00 to 9:00, or 75 percent complete. This is great if you’re mostly concerned with your step goal and not the actual number of steps, distance or other metrics. Since it is such a simple device, you need the app to view information that’s not displayed on the screen.","Another one of the step counter’s great design features is that it’s waterproof. The Withings Go is waterproof up to 50 meters, or 5 ATM, which means you can wear it in the shower, while doing laps in the pool and on a rainy day runs. This is one of the few waterproof pedometers we reviewed, and it’s also one of the best because the screen is still visible underwater.
