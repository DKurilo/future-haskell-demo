It has the highest Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) of the models we reviewed – 12.4. While it isn’t the most powerful unit we evaluated, its efficiency helps it perform above average.","With 5,200 Btu of power, the GE AEM05LX can cool a room of about 260 square feet, which is a bigger space than most window ACs we reviewed can handle. Its maximum airflow is a modest 145 cubic feet per minute, but it does a good job of circulating air with its four-way directional louvers. This unit also has the lowest estimated yearly energy cost, just $38 per year.","This GE window AC doesn’t have a lot of extras. For instance, it doesn’t have a dehumidify-only mode, which is one reason it can only remove 1.4 pints of water from the air per hour. For comparison, our best overall pick, the <a href=\"/lg-lw8017ersm-review\">LG LW8017ERSM</a>, can remove 2.2 pints per hour.","This model also doesn’t have a sleep mode or an auto-restart feature. As such, if there is a power outage, the AC doesn’t automatically restore to its previous settings, something many of the ACs we reviewed do. However, it has an energy-saving mode. In this mode, the compressor and fans only run as needed to keep the room at your desired temperature.","This air conditioner is relatively compact and weighs less than most of the units we considered, which makes it easier to install. The window kit allows it to fit in most windows.","The AEM05LX comes with a standard one-year appliance and compressor warranty. This is a little disappointing since some of the ACs we reviewed have compressor warranties of up to five years.","GE has a good support base. You can contact the company with questions via phone, email or live chat. When we contacted representatives with questions they were friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful.","The GE AEM05LX is a midrange window AC that is very energy efficiency. It has the best EER of any AC we reviewed, and it can cool a larger-than-average room of up to 260 square feet. It also costs less to operate than the other window ACs we evaluated. However, its lack of convenience feature keeps it behind the best ACs we reviewed. Still, its solid construction and great customer support help make it a good choice for the right consumer."]},"id":"2c850db8-cd25-4871-8177-2716240ba003","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69967","url":"/ge-aem05lx-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-05-21T18:18:31Z","datePublished":"2018-05-21T18:18:31Z","name":"GE AEM05LX","synopsis":"The GE AEM05LX is a midrange window air conditioner with great energy efficiency.
