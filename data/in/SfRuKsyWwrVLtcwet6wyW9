Where most low-cost RC copters have co-axial rotors – great for stability, but terrible for control – the iRocket&#39;s single tilting rotor is highly maneuverable. You can move the iRocket laterally, strafing from side to side without changing its orientation. The gyroscope, meanwhile, helps keep the machine upright, staving off crashes when you&#39;re still starting out.","The best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/954-best-cheap-drones.html\">RC helicopters</a> feature internal, electronic gyroscopes, but the Hero iRocket doesn&#39;t have one. It instead uses a crossbar, which is a common stabilizer that&#39;s mounted above the rotor blades, spinning along with them to provide balance in the face of sharp turns and deft maneuvers. The crossbar keeps the iRocket from flipping and crashing when you&#39;re darting around your home, but it also negates the possibility of loops or other extreme tricks.","That said, the iRocket has a secondary flight mode that essentially doubles its speed, turning graceful turns into flitting snaps around the room. You might not be able to flip the aircraft, but you can pull some jolting leaps from point to point.","The Hero iRocket is, for its size, the lightest RC helicopter we reviewed. While a couple micro-size quadcopters are lighter, they&#39;re small enough to perch on a finger or two; the iRocket&#39;s 10-inch girth needs your whole hand. Thanks to its carbon frame, however, it&#39;s incredibly light and resilient to impacts, able to spring back from high-speed crashes without noticeable hull damage. Since the copter&#39;s rotors are fixed instead of swing-wing, they can snap off in the event of a crash, but they&#39;re easy to remount and cheap to replace should the need arise."]},"id":"dcfe0b09-1177-4f4c-95af-75f75d97ce47","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f4f9ea94-75fa-4f8f-b71e-d9d3166270cc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We had a blast flying the Hero iRocket.
