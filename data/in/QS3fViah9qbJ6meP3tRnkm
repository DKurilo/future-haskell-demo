Most notably, it comes with waterproof housing and a series of mounts that you can use to attach it to bikes, skateboards, scooters and more. In contrast to the other cameras on our lineup, which kids have to set down before they engage in another activity, the Action Cam encourages kids to be more active and document their adventures with a convenient, mountable camera.","In addition to this benefit, the Kidizoom Action Cam is more durable, engaging and easy to use than most other <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">kids&#39; cameras</a>. It boasts a hearty, rubberized exterior, quality games and activities, simple menus, and well-marked buttons.
