While we would normally consider this a downside, the upright stand has a very flexible arm. Out of the box, it required a little more setup than some of the A-frame stands we tested, but the extra flexibility more than made up for the slightly longer assembly time. ","In fact, this monitor solved a problem that none of the others really addressed: As you change the angle of the display, you may want pull the monitor closer or push it further away to get a comfortable distance between you and the screen. Many of the A-frame stands we reviewed recline easily, but when you want to push or pull them, they drag awkwardly across the work surface.  The Dell P2418HT’s display moves forward and backward without you having to move the stand every time you adjust the angle.","As much as we liked this feature, there is a downside to this ergonomic solution. The Dell P2418HT doesn’t rest directly on the desk, and as a result, the display bounces or shakes as you use various applications – especially while typing on the monitor. It also doesn’t recline as much as some of the other monitors we reviewed.","The monitor isn’t as thin and sleek as some of the other models in our comparison, but the controls are smartly located on the bottom of the bezel. This is a practical solution for a touchscreen that gives the display a clean look.","This monitor has a matte, slightly textured surface. While this significantly reduces glare and reflection on the display, we preferred monitors that have a smooth, glassy surface because they are more comfortable to use, like the <a href=\"/acer-t232hl-review\">Acer T232HL</a>.  There’s a small black buffer between the touch display and the bezel, and even though it’s thin, the overall experience is not as satisfying as with a seamless design. ","Even though it’s one of the largest touchscreen displays we reviewed, this monitor has a lower average power consumption than many of its smaller competitors. It’s also an HD touchscreen display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080.   The Dell P2418HT’s response time – about six milliseconds. If you’re a gamer or plan to watch fast-paced videos, a fast response time prevents ghosting, an anomaly that occurs when colors don’t change as quickly as the action in a game or movie. The Dell’s good response time can positively impact the quality of the movies and videos you watch.","You don’t want your monitor to emit so much light that it blinds you or wastes energy, but you do need it to be bright enough to compete with other light sources in your office or home. These effects are controlled by brightness settings on most monitors. The Dell P2418HT monitor’s brightness caps off at 250 cd/m, which is typical for a touchscreen.","This display also has better default color accuracy than most of the other monitors in our comparison. Since the displayed colors are truer right out of the box, you don’t need to makes as many adjustments.","On the other hand, the Dell P2418HT has a longer lag time than most – it takes around 15 milliseconds for the display information to reach the midpoint of the screen. This is a problem for serious gamers who need to respond as quickly as they can to the events happening on screen. The Gamma Avg. score, which shows how detailed and dimensional images on a monitor can be, is further from the 2.2 industry standard than most of the other displays we reviewed.  ","The monitor comes with a panel that conceals the various ports on the back, but because of the display’s neck and arm, they’re a little difficult to access. The upright neck has a hole, which works as a cord organization system. While its ports are hard to reach, the Dell P2418HT is one of the most connectible monitors in our comparison. This model has both an HDMI and DisplayPort as well as three USB 3.0 ports, which download files at a much higher speed than older USB 2.0 connections. ","You can find a wide variety of support materials on Dell’s website, including email, phone and live chat contact information. The drivers and manual are also available for download from the website. "]},"id":"0fd8c980-a772-4654-9e60-5c4dc466502f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"998ac965-a988-4c1e-a827-978ea6dfa4e9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Dell’s P2318HT employs several creative solutions to design problems typical of touchscreen monitors.
