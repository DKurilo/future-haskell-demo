The resulting ball of dough was shiny and elastic – exactly what you want in a perfectly prepared dough. You can even use this exclusively as a dough mixer.","We also put the machine through its paces with a cookie dough test. This mixer, fitted with the basic paddle, managed to cream the butter and sugar well, leaving only a bit of butter on the side of the bowl. It was quick and easy to add the dry ingredients as the mixer slowly incorporated them, and we didn’t end up wearing the flour.","Breville’s whisk attachment looks like a big balloon of metal wires, and it worked well whipping lots of air into egg whites. We started with room temperature egg whites and whipped them at the mixer’s highest speed for a set amount of time. Breville managed to fluff up the egg whites to nine times their original volume.","An LED indicator shows you what speed you’ve chosen, and next to each one of 12 speed settings are helpful hints about what tasks each speed can perform. In addition to the excellent design of this machine and the precise placement of the mixer head, attachment and bowl, the orbital movement of the agitator ensures you get consistent batter and dough results. Also, you can load up your mixer and know that if you’ve added too many ingredients, the Breville stops to prevent burning out the motor."]},"id":"dae7db8b-ce3d-44b7-90e3-f8f472d76b1f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"3c29166f-2051-4c0f-af20-3b20e4229b3a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/RfRsajNmYQSinqCBLaaVy7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/51783-breville-bem800xl13.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RfRsajNmYQSinqCBLaaVy7.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"RfRsajNmYQSinqCBLaaVy7","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RfRsajNmYQSinqCBLaaVy7.jpg","alt":""},"id":"27ad250f-a2f6-4a53-8d92-6d620e222991","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Breville has two features that help keep you as clean as possible: a slow start and a splashguard. The lowest speed setting folds ingredients, so they don’t splash or puff up in your face. The plastic splashguard seemed a bit fragile when we first put the two pieces together and placed it on the bowl, but once it was on it seemed secure, and it was easy to slide ingredients down the plastic chute.","The timer on the LCD screen allows you to choose to count up or down, depending on what you’re doing. If you have a bread dough recipe that requires you to knead for 10 minutes, you can set the timer to count down and walk away – the machine automatically turns off when the kneading is done.
