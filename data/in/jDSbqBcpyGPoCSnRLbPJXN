You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Troy-Bilt Big Red Garden <a href=\"/best-tillers\">Tiller</a> is a powerful rear-tine rototiller that offers long-lasting durability and can manage almost any tilling task. This model is particularly suited to large growing spaces and those that haven&#39;t been properly worked for years.","With rear-facing tines and an impressive 20-inch tilling width, the Troy-Bilt Big Red Garden Tiller tills up to 7 inches deep, giving you enough depth to make sure the bed you&#39;re preparing has sufficient drainage and fine, properly structured soil for maximum plant growth.","To match the sheer size of the 20-inch tilling width and the 12-inch tines, this garden tiller features a 305 cc Briggs and Stratton engine, giving it plenty of power, even when tilling compacted or heavy clay soils. The wrap-around front bumper protects the machine from bumps and scrapes by stopping you from getting too close to garden buildings, trees or garden features.","The standard tires measure 16 inches, and these provide adequate traction for most tasks. Unfortunately, for the toughest jobs, these tires aren&#39;t heavy enough to provide the tines with enough bite. However, you can add wheel weights, making the machine heavier, providing additional traction, enabling the tines to bite down harder, giving the hardest ground a fine till.","This Troy-Bilt rototiller is popular because of its ease of use and operational safety in comparison to the power and heavy-duty capabilities. It features an electric start for fast and easy engine startup. In spite of the weight, size and power of the Big Red Garden Tiller, it is exceptionally well balanced, allowing for one-handed operation as you guide the tiller along the row, requiring less physical exertion. The bronze gear drive transmission boasts a cast-iron encasement, increasing strength, durability, and lifespan. To keep you safe and well away from the tines, this model features full-sided tine shields.","Because of the large investment, you&#39;ll likely want to get the very most from your Troy-Bilt Big Red Garden Tiller, which includes using different attachments, such as the hiller-furrower, which takes the effort out of digging furrows for potatoes, plants and other root crops. You also get a two-year limited manufacturer&#39;s warranty on the machine itself, a limited lifetime warranty on the gear drive transmission and a two-year manufacturer&#39;s warranty on the Briggs and Stratton engine.","Overall, the Troy-Bilt Big Red Garden Tiller is a top-quality high-end power tiller, delivering plenty of power and features. The necessity of buying optional attachments, to improve traction for bigger jobs and to increase versatility, is something of a letdown, given the cost. However, this rototiller does offer long-lasting durability, safety and ease of use for almost any tilling task."]},"id":"83600e6c-a774-4edc-952d-e2c430c3a1a2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62720","url":"/troy-bilt-big-red-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-11T22:24:11Z","datePublished":"2015-02-11T22:24:11Z","name":"Troy-Bilt Big Red","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
