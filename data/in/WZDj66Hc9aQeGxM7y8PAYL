You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","Infinity is one of the most respected speaker brands under the Harman International umbrella of loudspeakers. However, as with many speaker manufacturers, its <a href=\"/best-marine-speakers\">marine audio products</a> are slim pickings, with just a few sizes available in the Marine series. We reviewed the Infinity Marine 652M, which is a 6.5-inch boat speaker designed to be installed in the cockpit or cabin of your boat. In our tests, the audio quality wasn’t impressive, but the power handling is great. The biggest issue is the lack of durability.","In our audio performance tests, which gauged the accuracy of the speaker as it played a 20Hz to 20kHz sine wave, it received above-average grades in each of the three ranges – low, medium and high. The low frequencies received a B, the midrange frequencies received a B-, and the high frequencies received a B+. So overall, the audio quality is good but not great. The mids and treble are very balanced, though the bass often overpowers them."]},"id":"279a5fc7-2763-44a4-a9bd-5fc4bcbd10aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/p9SjHck7dYMXEGGxP8duSE.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"One of the best features of the Infinity Marine is the high sensitivity rating. With a 92 dB sensitivity rating (which is the same as the <a href=\"/home/auto/best-marine-speakers/polk-speakers-review/\">Polk MM</a> and the <a href=\"/home/auto/best-marine-speakers/polk-review/\">Polk DB+</a>), it&#39;s the most efficient speaker in our review for converting power to volume. The average sensitivity rating for marine speakers in our review is 90 dB, which is 66 percent less efficient when you consider that every 3 dB increase in volume requires an exponential increase in power. This is very important for boat speakers because of the limited acoustic advantages of being out on the water – you need efficient speakers to produce loud volumes.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/reviews/55872/infinity-marine-2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p9SjHck7dYMXEGGxP8duSE.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"p9SjHck7dYMXEGGxP8duSE","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p9SjHck7dYMXEGGxP8duSE.jpg","alt":""},"id":"f0d0bf2b-7174-4bce-beeb-5b6b49a31048","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The continuous power handling is 75 watts, which is slightly above average. With the high sensitivity rating, the Marine puts that power to good use, so you don&#39;t have to worry about it not being loud enough.

While the woofer, tweeter, grille and frame are made of stiff polypropylene, which is an ideal material for being near water, ASTM certification is important. Despite Infinity’s marketing, which suggests that the speakers are durable, without the ASTM certifications, you can’t be sure."]},"id":"a40f0ec6-35aa-48f4-a531-de441c276a41","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3ca0eb1a-c64b-40eb-bd70-388d4ee08f91","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Infinity Marine is one of the best-sounding boat speakers we reviewed.
