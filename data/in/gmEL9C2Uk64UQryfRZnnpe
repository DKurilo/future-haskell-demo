The Nest smartphone app is easy to navigate and lets you control other Nest products as well. The Nest Hello is the only doorbell we reviewed that comes with pre-recorded responses, which you use to tell visitors to leave packages, wait at the door or that no-one&#39;s available. It&#39;s a thoughtful feature that streamlines how you interact with visitors, especially ones you don&#39;t want to speak with.","The Nest Hello also has the most advanced detection features we&#39;ve seen, it can detection motion, sound and people. Although <a href=\"/ring-video-doorbell-pro-review\">Ring Video Doorbell Pro</a> also features people detection, we like that Nest goes a step further by recognizing familiar faces and letting you know who&#39;s visiting.","With the motion detection, you can create specific zones to ignore activity on busy streets while focusing on your steps or porch, though you can&#39;t set these up in the smartphone app, you must use the web portal on a computer. You can also schedule when your doorbell sends motion alerts, though Nest doesn&#39;t let you adjust the overall sensitivity of its motion detector like other video doorbells. Except for the scheduling feature, Nest requires a Nest Aware subscription to adjust motion detection settings, which makes the doorbell less useful to non-subscribers."]},"id":"cb6071d5-69a6-447d-8b1a-82679444f660","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/RtpZXp3QqDdirWDbXDGmq6.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/70138-nest-hello1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RtpZXp3QqDdirWDbXDGmq6.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"RtpZXp3QqDdirWDbXDGmq6","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RtpZXp3QqDdirWDbXDGmq6.jpg","alt":""},"id":"d75fa852-601e-4352-9ba7-9a275a3de663","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nest Hello is compatible with other Nest smart home devices such as the <a href=\"/nest-review\">Nest Learning Thermostat</a>, <a href=\"/nest-x-yale-review\">Nest x Yale</a> smart lock and Nest Guard security system.
