Plugging a guitar into your computer or gaming console allows the software to track your progress through the lessons and gives you instant feedback on which notes you played incorrectly. The riff repeater feature can help you practice the hardest portions of the song by slowing the tempo and walking you step-by-step through the riff until you’re comfortable playing the song at the original tempo. <br />\n<br />\nThe most unique feature in Rocksmith is the Session Mode. This is one of only two programs we reviewed that teaches the underrated skill of improvising, and Rocksmith’s improvisation lessons are virtually endless. You learn to improvise by jamming with a virtual band of artificial-intelligence musicians that adapt and react to your playing, which improves your rhythm training and gets you ready to play with other real musicians.","<a href=\"/rocksmith-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"74f430c7-12e5-4e51-99a8-7fa5f251ae8f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Value"},"id":"affb203c-adae-45b7-b928-54a5f69de083","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/rwxdQxhFqzb3Y9GFEPQMJb.jpg","link":{"href":"/action-tab-review","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/6/L/737661/original/Guitar-Lesson-Software-ActionTab-001.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwxdQxhFqzb3Y9GFEPQMJb.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"rwxdQxhFqzb3Y9GFEPQMJb","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwxdQxhFqzb3Y9GFEPQMJb.jpg","alt":"ActionTab"},"id":"367156c3-0619-4121-b28c-17b9b64b5a28","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"ActionTab\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/action-tab-review\">ActionTab</a>","pros":["Low-cost monthly subscription","New songs and lessons added regularly","Wide range of musical genres"],"cons":["No audio or video instruction","No interactive feedback","It doesn’t teach you to read tablature"]},"id":"706dcfd8-a549-4bb4-94bf-968f1d4ec4ba","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ActionTab offers a low-cost entrance into the world of guitar lessons.

At Top Ten Reviews, we research and evaluate each product and make our recommendations based on quantitative data, like the total number of lessons, and qualitative data, like our impression of how easy the software makes the learning process. There are a few advanced level guitar players in our office, but we felt it was more appropriate to evaluate these products from the standpoint of someone who has never taken a lesson.","We prefer to review and evaluate products that work for a wide range of ages and skill levels, but we also tried to find products and make recommendations based on specific use cases to help you find a product that best suits your needs. For instance, we found that programs that have interactive games are a good way to keep the attention of teenagers and young adults, and products that have a diverse song list with multiple musical genres are more appropriate for adults. We like to approach the research and evaluation process by finding features you won’t find in marketing materials, and let you know whether we think those features will benefit you.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","Each guitar lesson software uses a different interface and curriculum to deliver lessons, and we realize that people using these products may have a different idea of what is easier or more effective. That is why we rank the products in this comparison by finding as many useful features as possible and awarding higher scores to products that include the most usable features.","We identified lesson coverage, practice tools, lesson accompaniment and support features as the most important aspects of a good lesson software. Within those categories, you’ll find more specific tools and features we believe are beneficial to the learning process for most guitar players, like tempo adjustment, loop playback and interactive games.","<strong>Features to Look for When Buying Guitar Lesson Software</strong>","Chord Dictionary<br/>A chord dictionary displays the hand and finger positions that make up various chords. There are many chords and many variations of those chords, so it can be difficult to remember the finger placement and name of each. The best software programs have an exhaustive list of chords that you can use as a reference when you come across a chord variation that you’ve never played.","Progress Tracking<br/>A lesson software that can provide instant feedback about notes you played correctly and incorrectly will make learning faster and more efficient. If you know immediately which parts of the song you are struggling with, you can go back and focus on those troublesome riffs.","Adjustable Tempo<br/>The ability to slow the tempo of a song can help you learn intricate runs and difficult chords. Once you have the part mastered, you can adjust the tempo back to the original speed and work on transitioning between the hard and easy parts of the song.<br/><strong><br/>More Guides for Learning and Making Music:</strong>"]},"id":"9be799ed-2664-41dc-aace-f243436e84eb","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-learn-piano-online\">The Best Online Piano Lessons</a>","<a href=\"/best-music-notation-software\">The Best Music Notation Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-beat-making-software\">The Best Beat Making Software</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"5c055882-b202-4165-ba7c-059639616148","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_58","url":"/best-guitar-lesson-software","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-12-18T21:52:04Z","datePublished":"2017-12-18T21:52:04Z","name":"Best Guitar Lesson Software","synopsis":"We reviewed a handful of guitar lesson programs, each costing less than $80, to bring you the best alternatives to in-person lessons.","review":{},"strapline":"We reviewed a handful of guitar lesson programs, each costing less than $80, to bring you the best alternatives to in-person lessons.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-01T21:43:56Z","id":"PNonQxEu6XUoGhRpw4ZmpG","meta":{"title":"Best Guitar Learning Software - Programs to Learn Guitar","description":"We reviewed a handful of guitar lesson programs, each costing less than $80, to bring you the best alternatives to in-person lessons."},"products":[{"slug":"rocksmith","url":"/product/rocksmith","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","name":"Rocksmith","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","id":"QohE2LZJhWeWri7MtDjs4H","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"actiontab","url":"/product/actiontab","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","name":"ActionTab","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","id":"78aXFHzw3mrZJpW8SFaTQ8","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"emedia-guitar-method","url":"/product/emedia-guitar-method","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","name":"eMedia Guitar Method","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","id":"25LTX4P8KUmXoKUviT4gb6","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/FY63v7HdeEDqrz3UFYABkN.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","mimeType":"","name":"HERO-Guitar-Lesson-Software.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/W/8/737288/original/HERO-Guitar-Lesson-Software.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","id":"FY63v7HdeEDqrz3UFYABkN","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FY63v7HdeEDqrz3UFYABkN.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Guitar Lesson Software","description":"We reviewed a handful of guitar lesson programs, each costing less than $80, to bring you the best alternatives to in-person lessons."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/FY63v7HdeEDqrz3UFYABkN.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","mimeType":"","name":"HERO-Guitar-Lesson-Software.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/W/8/737288/original/HERO-Guitar-Lesson-Software.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","id":"FY63v7HdeEDqrz3UFYABkN","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FY63v7HdeEDqrz3UFYABkN.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Guitar Lesson Software","description":"We reviewed a handful of guitar lesson programs, each costing less than $80, to bring you the best alternatives to in-person lessons."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"learning-software","url":"/hobbies/learning-software","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","name":"Learning Software","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:11:08Z","id":"4rDnxPcDkoTmubv3QyJNG4","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
