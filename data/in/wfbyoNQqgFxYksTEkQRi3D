It uses up to 6,000 British thermal units (Btu), which is the amount of energy needed to heat or cool 1 pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The more Btu an air conditioner has, the larger the space the device can cool. This Frigidaire model can cool a room of approximately 250 square feet. Furthermore, this device removes up to 1.3 pints of moisture from the air per hour and features an airflow of 152 cubic feet per minute, which is quite good.","Another advantage of this product is its energy efficiency. This window air conditioner is Energy Star certified and boasts an Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) of 11.2, which is excellent. The best window air conditioners have an EER of 10 or greater.","Furthermore, when we compared the estimated annual energy cost of this product, it was cheaper than many energy-efficient window air conditioners. We estimated the energy cost of the product based on eight hours of use a day for a three-month period. This Frigidaire unit’s estimated cost was $46.31. Many similar products were several dollars more each year.","The Frigidaire FFRE0633Q1 is UL Listed, which means the air conditioner unit has passed public safety standards and been tested by Underwriters Laboratories. It is also AHAM certified, which means it has received a performance certification by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers.

The remote features numerous setting options, a timer and a power button.","There are several settings and modes on this product, including three cooling speeds. When using the cool setting, the fan and compressor run to lower the temperature of the room. You can also use one of three fan settings to run the fan without the compressor. In this mode, the fan helps circulate the air in the room without actually cooling the room down. Additional modes include an auto mode and an energy saving mode.","In addition to those listed above, this product features a sleep mode. It is useful, and not all window air conditioners offer this advanced feature. When the unit is in this mode, your selected temperature increases by 2 degrees Fahrenheit every 30 minutes. Once the room reaches this new temperature, it remains stable for up to seven hours before the unit automatically switches back to its original temperature.","Unfortunately, there is no dry setting that works to remove excess moisture and humidity from a room.
