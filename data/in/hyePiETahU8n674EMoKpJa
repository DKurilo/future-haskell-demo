You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Hunter Contempo 557903 is a 52-inch, low-profile <a href=\"/best-ceiling-fans\">ceiling fan</a> designed for large rooms with its high air circulation capabilities. In addition to its sheer power, the device is built with a modern and contemporary appearance that ranges from its five dark maple blades to its onyx Bengal finish. Combined with its amber glass light dome, this device is not only aesthetically appealing, but practical as both fan and light fixture alike.","This quiet ceiling fan achieves exceptional airflow rates for a fan of its size, performing at more than 5,000 cubic feet per minute. With regard to airflow efficiency it rates at 67 cubic feet of air per watt. As is typical of any ceiling fan with lights, when the lights are on, the airflow efficiency rating will drop even lower.","This top ceiling fan comes with five blades, two light bulbs and two different sets of mounting hardware. The different mounting options allow the fan to be mounted in a standard vertical hanging fashion or angled for a vaulted ceiling. Flush mounting kits aren’t an option with this unit, as the fan is designed for hanging with a measurement of anywhere from 10.45 inches to 14.43 inches from the ceiling. The vertical height of this ceiling fan means that you should plan its placement in a room where it’ll be at least seven feet above the ground, so as to avoid the danger of striking peoples’ heads.","This best ceiling fan is equipped with a WhisperWind motor, a proprietary device that deliver incredible air movement with complete silence. The motor itself is covered by a lifetime warranty and operates at an efficiency level that equates to an operational cost of $0.007 per hour while on the lowest speed setting. This equates to nearly five percent of the total energy consumption of a standard toaster, which means the fan will provide minimal impact to your electrical bill.","The Hunter Contempo 557903 is a ceiling fan designed with long fan blades to achieve a high level of air circulation. Combined with an innovative motor designed for both energy efficiency and quiet operation, this device is one that will make you easily forget when it’s operating. With this fan even on the highest speed setting, you’ll still be able to hold conversations and hear the television without excess background noise created by ceiling fans."]},"id":"6b36602c-1b88-4677-86f5-52a48188716a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56755","url":"/hunter-contempo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-14T01:56:54Z","datePublished":"2013-06-14T01:56:54Z","name":"Hunter Contempo 557903","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
