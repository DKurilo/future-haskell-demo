Their downloadable software allows you to create books and albums with your photos on your own machine, rather than online. With this, you can work on your projects at any time without an internet connection, granting you a great degree of flexibility. They provide an ample set of features with more than enough functions to make your photo book look great. We were a little disappointed with this software’s ease of use; it’s rather counterintuitive and occasionally throws in additional, unneeded steps that make the process more of a hassle than it needs to be. Overall, we found this photo book software to be an acceptable alternative to other products on our lineup, but it doesn’t have what it takes to rank at the top of our comparison.","DigiLabs powers the MyPhotoCreations photo album software, and they bring years of professional photographic and design experience to bear in their technology. This parent company provides several convenient and helpful tools for professional photographers and small-time hobbyists alike. They pride themselves on their usability and efficiency, features which are strangely unapparent in their photo book software. While their photo book software has some drawbacks, it is a respectable application overall, and it will help you create your own photo projects with a few extra features."]},"id":"c75f2728-11b7-4288-83b7-09dac3b906ea","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Quality &amp; Services"},"id":"6b4dd5fa-2479-4c90-9265-63b7a2b91679","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["MyPhotoCreations provides a few templates for you to choose from, though they are largely occasion-themed and do not provide flexibility outside of this option. We were hoping for a generic theme that would allow us some more flexibility, rather than being forced to use a blank theme with static backgrounds or a specific occasion theme. We would like to see a few more options in this category, with the ability to edit the templates if we desired.","A lot of the other basic software of this type features are available with MyPhotoCreations, including a photo editor, a photo organizer, embellishments, positioning abilities, and photo captioning features. They also offer both glossy and matte paper finishes, which you can select from the checkout. However, the only binding option is a hardbound photo cover."]},"id":"fa52677a-db6c-4022-b927-6ebaf2ff9d40","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Book Options"},"id":"63d461b9-a2bd-42fe-b3c8-6c1f59ab5af5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We had some difficulty navigating the application; it was constructed in a way that made most normal tasks a bit more strenuous.
