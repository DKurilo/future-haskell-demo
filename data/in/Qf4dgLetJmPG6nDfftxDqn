The Racing Wheel 4 is also compatible with the PS3, however, it isn&#39;t a PC steering wheel - it doesn&#39;t immediately work on PCs. Overall, this isn&#39;t the best racing wheel on the market, but there aren&#39;t very many options to choose from when it comes to the latest console generation. The Racing Wheel 4 has a decent feature list and solid design, but its customization options are sadly lacking.","We were impressed with the number of buttons available on the Racing Wheel 4. You have 14 buttons to help you control your vehicle in racing games. However, we weren&#39;t impressed with the device&#39;s rotation range – you only get 180 degrees of motion. This is enough to play most racing games, but it isn&#39;t very realistic and doesn&#39;t leave you many options for adjusting steering sensitivity.","On back of the 10-inch wheel, you&#39;ll find paddle shifters that the place of a stick shift. The Racing Wheel 4&#39;s floor grip keeps the pedals from sliding around too much when you hit the gas. Unfortunately, you won&#39;t get any force feedback with this gaming steering wheel. That&#39;s a big let down because it adds a level of realism you just can&#39;t get without it. The Racing Wheel 4 does have a rumble feature to help simulate road conditions.","Hori&#39;s help and support options are not particularly great. The warranty on the Racing Wheel 4 is only 90 days long. You can contact the support team through email, but not via phone. There are FAQs and a decent user guide to help you set up the Racing Wheel 4. Overall, the support is lackluster compared to other manufacturers."]},"id":"9b99a852-a32f-4262-9647-5ce0fd5f8e7f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1c87ac5b-c502-468c-bfbe-d84bf46807c5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This certainly isn&#39;t the best racing wheel ever made, but with few options to choose from on the PS4, the Racing Wheel 4 has a solid spot in the market.
