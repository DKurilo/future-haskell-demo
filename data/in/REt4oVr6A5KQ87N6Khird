However, its recording capacity is limited, and it is missing commonplace features like parental controls and an HDMI port. Its list of features is short, but it works fine for those wanting basic DVR features.","The <a href=\"/best-dvrs\">digital video recorder</a> has a built-in 64GB hard drive, which is enough to record and play back 40 hours of high definition content or even more standard definition shows. Because of its comparably small onboard storage capacity, however, you’ll find yourself having to delete recorded content in order to make room for newer content much more frequently than you would if you had a DVR with, say, a 1TB internal hard drive, like the <a href=\"/tivo-roamio-review\">TiVo Roamio OTA VOX</a>. The Roamio is the kind of recorder we recommend for power users or those with large families. If you want this device but need more storage, there is a USB 2.0 port located at the rear of the device where you can plug in an external hard drive up to 8TB.","Unlike the best DVR devices, the 64GB OTA only has two tuners, which limits you to recording only two shows at once, or only one if you want to watch something simultaneously. Most other devices in our comparison have four or more tuners.","It has a few other standard features, like the ability to skip commercials, and you can schedule the recording of future shows. The Tablo 64GB OTA has a built-in channel guide, but it’s limited to a short 24-hour schedule. There is no parental control feature, however, so you’ll need to be proactive if you want to control the content they watch.","Though most other devices can record from multiple sources, this video recorder is limited to only over-the-air content. It has no way to access or record any content from your cable or satellite provider. However, it does include a companion mobile app where you can watch your recorded content or schedule a future recording.","Despite its lack of 4K support, the 64GB OTA can play video in lower HD resolutions, up to 1080i/1080p. As for connectivity, this DVR has USB 2.0, Ethernet and coax connections. It does not have composite or component video ports. A 30-day trial for Nuvyyo’s Tablo TV Guide Data Subscription is included, and you can continue with it for a small monthly fee.","The DVR measures 4.9 inches wide, 4.8 inches long and 1.5 inches tall. It weighs just 7.4 ounces, so it is fairly easy to store without being an aesthetic distraction.","The Tablo 64GB OTA is one of the least expensive units in our comparison, though it does require a monthly subscription in order to be fully functional. It comes with basic port access and a small amount of onboard storage. and can only access over-the-air content. Though it can only access over-the-air content and has no parental controls, this basic DVR can be an ideal option for cord-cutters and small households."]},"id":"dc611014-340f-455c-b11d-2a052fb16a50","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70111","url":"/tablo-dual-64gb-ota-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-07-11T21:19:26Z","datePublished":"2018-07-11T21:19:26Z","name":"Tablo Dual 64GB OTA","synopsis":"The Tablo 64GB OTA is a pretty fuss-free DVR which provides decent access to over-the-air (OTA) content.
