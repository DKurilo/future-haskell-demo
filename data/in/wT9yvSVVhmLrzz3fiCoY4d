ThermoWorks Thermopop TX-3100 is a reliable <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">meat thermometer</a> with a simple design and delicate probe. It reads a wide range of temperatures and achieves a readout in less than 8 seconds.","The manufacturer states you can get an initial temperature response in five to six seconds, though it only takes a bit longer to get a full temperature reading. In our testing, it took us an average of 7.4 seconds to achieve a full readout, one of the fastest we encountered. The probe registers temperatures between -58 and 572 degrees Fahrenheit, with an accuracy rating of within two degrees of the actual temperature up to 248 degrees. This is a fairly wide temperature range compared to other models, but the accuracy variance is just average, as most models have similar capabilities.","This thermometer displays readings rounded to the nearest whole degree. If you prefer readings that go past the decimal point, you might want to try the <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">Lavatools Javelin</a>. That said, on a tool whose margin of error is about 2 degrees, the extra precision isn’t all that meaningful.","This is one of the best meat thermometers due to its convenient design. It 4.5-inch probe is long enough for large cuts of meats or pots of soup, while remaining compact and easy to store in a drawer in the included probe protector. The thermometer is also easy to use. The digital display can rotate in 90-degree increments, so you can read temperatures at most angles, even upside down. This is especially helpful if you’re left-handed or trying to measure food temperatures in odd positions, like reaching a turkey in the oven without pulling it out.","We found the display easy to read thanks to its tall, bold numbers. The thermometer is even equipped with a backlight that you can turn on for 10 seconds as needed, allowing you to better read temperatures for food still in the oven. We also appreciated that this thermometer turns on and off to conserve battery life, and has an auto-off functionality that turns off the thermometer after 10 minutes of inactivity. The meat thermometer uses a CR2032 battery, which should provide hundreds of hours of use on a single charge, but isn&#39;t as easy to find as a AAA battery that powers other thermometers.","The exterior of the display is lined with material that we found is easy to grip, even with two fingers, so it never feels too thin or uncomfortable to hold. The TX-3100 comes in nine colors. The included probe cover has a pen clip so that you can attach it to a folder or your pocket. The seals and buttons are molded into the body as part of its splash-proof and durable design. Though this instant-read thermometer’s construction is intended to withstand the rigors of varying temperatures, it isn’t meant to be left in the oven or on a grill. You get a two-year warranty with this meat thermometer, which is better than average."]},"id":"fba1197e-d2af-4542-9958-6ef5d6c97eb7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67431","url":"/thermoworks-thermopop-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-11-17T22:17:00Z","datePublished":"2015-11-17T22:17:00Z","name":"ThermoWorks Thermopop TX-3100","synopsis":"The ThermoWorks Thermopop TX-3100 is a reliable meat thermometer with a simple design and delicate probe.
