You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","We should love the ASUS Zenfone 2. A decent mid-tier phablet is itself a rarity, but ASUS upped the ante with a wonderful screen, a processor that&#39;s only about half a year behind the current flagship <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphones</a> and 4GB of RAM. The phone features dual-SIM compatibility, so you can hitch a ride on two different networks, and expandable storage in case the included 16GB, 32GB or 64GB aren&#39;t enough for you. Its camera is decent, it runs Android Lollipop and at an even 6 ounces, it&#39;s actually lighter than top big-screen smartphones like the Galaxy Note 4 or iPhone 6 Plus.","We should love the phone, but its quirks hold us back. For example, the Zenfone 2 packs a massive 3000 mAh battery, yet it lasted just 7 hours in our web browsing battery test. For comparison, the iPhone 6 lasted 7.5 hours on a battery about half the size. The phone itself is gorgeous from afar, but it proves itself to be cheap plastic up close; its edge was dented in a tiny drop that any aluminum or polycarbonate chassis would have laughed off.","The Zenfone runs Android Lollipop, but its ZenUI skin is bogged down with bloatware apps that pester. Mercifully, you can uninstall most of the incessant apps and silence notifications from the rest. The skin itself is extremely customizable, though our application dock stopped responding to our touches twice, and the problem wouldn&#39;t clear until we restarted the phone.","In the age of near-constant cell phone photography, the Zenfone 2&#39;s 13-megapixel camera is surprisingly passable. In theory, its ƒ/2.0 aperture allows you to take decent-quality photos in moderate lighting conditions without sacrificing quality. In practice, daylight photos are beautiful, but indoor shots can get a bit grainy. Nighttime photos are easy to fudge and blur – extended exposure times and a lack of quality image stabilization do that – and the phone&#39;s flash is a train wreck. If you&#39;re willing to dig into settings, though, ASUS&#39; camera app offers a cornucopia of customization options.","The most intriguing feature the camera offers is low-light mode. In situations where even the best smartphone sensors would pick up muddy splotches of black and brown, the Zenfone 2&#39;s sensor can combine groupings of four pixels, essentially capturing four times the light and turning unusable photos into serviceable pictures. It reduces the quality of the resulting image to a pitiful 3 megapixels instead of the usual 13 megapixels, but you get usable shots in otherwise impossible situations."]},"id":"e8323728-d240-4a3c-b8c9-83cd50bb3a48","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"20fb4a87-a82b-41e6-beed-d037aa84f5ab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As our other smartphone reviews have shown, the best ones let you do what you want, when you want, without annoying you as you do it.
