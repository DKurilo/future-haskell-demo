This well-known home medical alert system monitoring center supports various systems throughout the country.","Walgreens Ready Response is simple to set up. After you receive your console, you just plug the console into a phone line and a power outlet. Press the help button to alert the monitoring center that the system works and then you’re ready for service. An activation fee is required to start up, but the good news is that no long-term contract is required.","In addition to the smartly designed console, the help pendant comes with three different attachment options: necklace, belt clip and wristband. The pendant has a 4-year battery life, but to ensure protection, it will send a signal to the monitoring center when the battery is low. Walgreens Ready Response will also notify your family and health care providers in case of an emergency. To ease your pocketbook worries, Walgreens provides a lifetime warranty on all equipment.","To ensure safety in the bathroom, the place where most falls occur, Walgreens Ready Response includes an additional wall-mountable activator for the bathroom. The telephone-line monitors are also a nice touch. They are used to detect and notify monitoring center personnel when incoming phone lines are out of order. Automatic monthly check-in calls, to make sure the equipment is working, are also included with the service.","Walgreens Ready Response offers toll-free, 24-hour customer service. You&#39;ll find FAQs and an email address on their website for further questions. You can also submit a request online to receive a call from a sales representative."]},"id":"d9d8f73a-0846-4917-8a0f-100e612c92ea","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"469e3aa3-dc8b-401a-9732-027823cfbc5c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Walgreens Ready Response is a quality medical monitoring service with the power of a respected brand name behind it.
