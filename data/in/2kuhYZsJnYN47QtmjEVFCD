Such is the case with the Samsung Omnia SGH-i900.

On the positive side, WinMo 6.1 includes MS Office Mobile Suite affording the most extensive document handling package available on a smartphone. It also supports real-time push email and automatic synchronization with MS Outlook applications using MS Exchange. On the other hand, WinMo is notoriously the antithesis of intuitive. It’s awkward and just plain clumsy compared to the operating systems offered on the <a href=\"/mobile/articles/mobile-operating-systems-demystified-iphone-os-mac-osx-goes-mobile/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"/mobile/articles/mobile-operating-systems-demystified-blackberry-operating-system/\">BlackBerry</a> smartphones.

Its display is bright and clear but comes up a bit short when compared to the very best available. Lacking a physical keyboard, the screen is the only means for typing and so poses the familiar limitations associated with touchscreens. To help, the screen provides the vibrations of haptic feedback. The intensity and patterns of the vibrations are user adjustable. There is the option of a full QWERTY virtual keyboard when in the landscape mode. Owing to the integrated accelerometer, rotating the device automatically switches the display to portrait mode. In that orientation, other input options such as Transciber for voice-to-text input and Block Recognizer, a Graffiti-like input method that allows for writing on the screen with a stylus, become available. Graffiti was a common method for writing with the Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) of the not too distant past, but has become rare with the advent of smartphones. Though Block Recognizer takes a bit of practice, once mastered, it can be a very attractive option."]},"id":"155ed10e-4af4-4572-9f0d-05fcc25c4152","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung Omnia comes equipped with a feature rich 5.0-megapixel camera that is likely the best among smartphones.

The camera boasts a wide selection of picture options including six size settings and three settings for quality. The array of shooting modes rivals some stand alone cameras with ISO settings, white balance adjustments, and a plethora of special effects options.
