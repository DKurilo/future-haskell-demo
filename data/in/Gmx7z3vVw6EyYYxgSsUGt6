No matter what you are doing online, if you&#39;re a Mac user, you can choose from several internet browsers. Some offer better speed, while others guarantee lower memory usage and more personalized browsing experiences. So what is the best <a href=\"/best-internet-browser-software\">internet browser</a> for Mac users?","<strong><strong>Safari</strong></strong>","Mac users can easily name Safari as the default browser for their machines. Not only does Safari work with MacBooks and iMacs, but it&#39;s also the default browser for iPhones and iPads. Safari 7 offers some of this browser&#39;s most advanced features, including syncing among devices, offline reading lists and iCloud tabs. If you use iOS on all of your devices, Safari is an excellent native browser choice.","<strong><strong>Opera</strong></strong>","Although Opera isn&#39;t the most popular browser on the market, it&#39;s the best Mac internet browser for those with slow internet connections. Since this browser compresses pages, it loads them faster than others browsers can. Opera also has an Off Road mode, which prompts the browser to check for an optimized version of a website before loading it. While Opera has many helpful new features, it doesn&#39;t offer the syncing or advanced bookmarking of other browsers.","<strong><strong>Firefox</strong></strong>","Firefox may not be the fastest browser, but it offers features that make it desirable for Mac users. Firefox boasts copious add-ons, which means it is highly customizable for users who want to add applications and other features that enhance their browsing experience. Firefox is also easy for web developers to use, especially with its social API, which allows developers and users to explore social media connections thoroughly.","<strong><strong>OmniWeb</strong></strong>","OmniWeb offers Mac users impressive control over viewing preferences. Instead of seeing a one-size-fits-all webpage or even a responsive page, this browser lets users change nearly any website&#39;s appearance. The look of any webpage is in your hands, as you can change elements like the font size and color. Since OmniWeb also offers Ad Blocker as a built-in feature, users can further customize what they see by hiding ads. Although OmniWeb is a less-conventional choice and has fewer advanced search functions, it makes a great option for internet users who want to have control over the look of the sites they view.","<strong><strong>Chrome</strong></strong>","A full-featured browser with many customization opportunities, Chrome is the best of all worlds. Not only is this browser the fastest out of all the primary options, but it also has many add-ons for a personalized browsing and ample troubleshooting. For developers, Chrome has plenty of options and customization opportunities. The browser also offers advanced syncing among devices and apps, so if you&#39;re constantly multitasking during your web-browsing sessions, Chrome is a great choice.","Depending on your needs and speed requirements, the best internet browser for Mac may be the simplest choice or the one with the greatest number of personalized features. Opt for the internet browser that best suits your leisure, work and other online activities. Once you make your decision, you&#39;ll have the best browser for your Mac at your fingertips."]},"id":"2a53aa12-780c-4280-b819-304b5b3e9d85","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9783","url":"/best-mac-browser","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-06T16:44:32Z","datePublished":"2015-08-06T16:44:32Z","name":"What is the Best Internet Browser for Mac?","synopsis":"You may be online for fun, work or something in between the two.
