However, it doesn&#39;t help matters if when you get to camp, you&#39;re struggling to chop wood with a knife or hammer in a tent stake with a rock.","Today&#39;s camping hatchets provide more than a blade on a handle; most offer simple tools such as a hammering head, while others provide fire-starting tools, ratchets, even bottle openers for when the chores are done. The right camping axe not only makes regular camping chores easier, but it also helps you tackle emergencies or problems on the trail.","Our testers at Active Junky evaluated many different brands and types of axes, from modern multitool versions to the traditional lumberjack style. They took them to testing grounds in the Appalachians, on South American expeditions, on camping trips and when boating. They used the axes for a multitude of camping tasks. After each task was completed, and the blade was able to demonstrate its safety and durability, our testers moved on to increasingly difficult challenges.","Our Active Junky testers put these axes through their paces to evaluate their durability, safety and performance.

They take every axe into the field, putting them through their paces for chopping wood, clearing brush, shaving spikes and driving tent stakes. They pushed them to, and sometimes past, the limits of what blade manufacturers say the axes can withstand.
