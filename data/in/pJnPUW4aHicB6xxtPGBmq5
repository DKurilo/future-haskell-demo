The system has every single feature we look for when we rank these products.

However, standard-definition content on media such as DVDs and some broadcast channels can&#39;t take advantage of all the pixels on a high-definition monitor or television. To combat this problem, the Philips Blu-ray Home Theater System employs 1080p upconversion technology. This feature scales standard-definition images into a high-definition signal that your HD television or monitor recognizes and displays at its full capacity. Keep in mind that this technology doesn&#39;t transform SD images into HD, but merely scales them to fit an HD screen.","One of the inherent problems with scaling standard-definition images onto a high-definition format is that the picture often looks distorted and skewed. To correct this problem somewhat, the Philips Blu-ray Home Theater System uses progressive scan technology to eliminate much of the visual artifacts and warped picture that happens when you scale an image to a larger resolution. The result is a crisper, clearer picture for standard-definition content.","Every movie theater presents films in a format called 24fps. This simply means that you are watching the movie at 24 frames per second. This format is what gives movies that cinematic feel associated with watching films in a movie theater. This Philips home theater replicates this look and feel for movies by displaying them in the same 24fps format you find in the theater.","Another reason the Philips Blu-ray Home Theater System takes the top spot on our side-by-side comparison chart is the fact that it includes its own integrated Blu-ray player. Many home theater in a box neglect to include any player whatsoever, focusing merely on the sound produced by their speakers. The omission of an integrated player on these lesser systems means that you are forced to buy a third-party player and then connect it to the home theater system. Not only does integrated Blu-ray player eliminate that inconvenience, but it also ensures that all the settings and features are optimized with the system&#39;s hardware for an outstanding home theater experience.","The system&#39;s integrated player plays Blu-ray Discs, DVDs and CDs. However, we are fast moving into a world where many or most of the television shows, movies, music and videos we watch are stored online or in the cloud. The Philips Blu-ray Home Theater System is capable of connecting to the internet and streaming content from services such as Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Pandora and many more, directly through the system&#39;s AV receiver to your screen and through your speakers. This ability puts the Philips Blu-ray Home Theater System on the edge of 21st-century entertainment technology.","One more feature worth mentioning in the video department is video-switching feature. This feature allows you to select video from several different sources. Chief among those sources is your cable television or internet service. Additionally, if you have a peripheral device such as an iPod or computer connected to the AV receiver, you can switch this home theater system to receive video from that device as well."]},"id":"87feb653-b0da-43e4-9824-a452458e5904","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Performance"},"id":"b30973cb-d4a3-4d97-91f1-6621ba5dad44","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/q77A6fJWEFGANdvWeXE9jc.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"A crisp, clear, beautiful high-definition image has little entertainment value without the rich surround sound that goes along with it.
