This system fits under your counter and includes a standard faucet. You can install this system on your own, without the help of a professional plumber, and it includes a one-year warranty. However, it is a basic system and lacks many features that you will find in more advanced water filter systems.","This Aqua-Pure water filter can reduce up to 13 different contaminants from your drinking water, including chlorine, sediment, fluoride, arsenic and cysts. However, there are several contaminants that this system cannot reduce, such as asbestos, mercury and herbicides. While this system removes some impurities from your water, â€¦several similar water filters, like the <a href=\"/kenmore-reverse-osmosis-system-review\">Kenmore Reverse Osmosis System</a>, can remove 20 or more pollutants.","One advantage to this unit is that the cartridges have a long lifespan. The cartridges can last approximately 12 months. This is excellent as many systems require that you replace the cartridges every six months. However, there is no notification system that will tell you when the cartridges are ready to be replaced. You will need to keep track of the maintenance schedule on your own.","The Aqua-Pure AP-RO5500 has a temperature range of 40 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. This is the average range for this type of water system. It also has a water pressure range of 30 to 125 psi, which is ideal for this type of system.","You can install this unit on your own without the help of a professional plumber. The system will take up a considerable amount of space under your counter as it is approximately 15 inches wide, 6 inches deep and 15 inches tall. It also weighs approximately 19 pounds.","This under-the-counter water filter solution is covered under a one-year warranty. This is the average amount of time most water filter systems are covered under warranty. If you do have any issues with this system, you can reach representatives via email, telephone and live chat support. We are pleased to see all three options were available as many companies only offer email and telephone support."]},"id":"104c1f6d-1807-4cf6-9a21-b87b281bfd37","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"78e342c3-f93d-4335-ab6b-09830861495d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Aqua-Pure AP-RO5500 is a basic water filtration system.
