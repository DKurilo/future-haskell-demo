It offers great multimedia playback capacities and massive external device compatibility. With its large quantity of features for its budget-friendly price point, it’s a great value on the aftermarket GPS navigation market.","Like all the other in-dash GPS systems in our comparison, the DDX24BT can play CDs and DVDs. It also has a satellite radio receiver so it can receive signals from SiriusXM, though that in itself requires a separate subscription. You can also play the standard AM/FM radio stations, and it gives you 24 station presets to work with: 18 for FM and 6 for AM. The <a href=\"/best-in-dash-navigation-systems\">navigation system</a> also lets you stream internet radio and songs or podcasts from apps like Spotify. Additionally, Bluetooth pairing allows you to connect up to two cell phones at a time – whether they’re Android, iOS or Windows – to listen to music, make calls or use certain smartphone apps, all hands-free.","You can customize the background of the interface and choose which language to use it in as the device gives you 21 languages to choose from. It comes with a remote control so you can navigate the interface easily or allow your rear-seat passengers to find a movie or song. You can adjust the screen’s brightness to make it easier to see.","The double-din navigation system has a resistive touchscreen that allows you to adjust the angle settings, which gives you the best off-axis viewing. If you connect a rear backup camera to the unit, parking guide lines will automatically appear to guide you. The display measures 6.2 inches and has a resolution of 800 x 408 pixels. The USB port lets you get connected to external devices like a jump drive or simply to rapidly charge your cell phone.","Kenwood offers technical support for its customers via email or phone, and the company has a social media presence. You can also troubleshoot problems on your own – or simply learn more about the product – by perusing the various informational resources on its website. The DDX24BT ships with a one-year warranty.","While the Kenwood DDX24BT lacks many of the commonplace navigation features found in many other devices, as well as any sort of premium functionality, it still does its job. Most of the device’s focus is on entertainment, though the DDX24BT is not a bad option for anyone trying to stay on budget."]},"id":"aea6d5dc-0be5-43e4-a436-b1b454e07eb1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69229","url":"/kenwood-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-04-17T14:02:23Z","datePublished":"2017-04-17T14:02:23Z","name":"Kenwood DDX24BT","synopsis":"The Kenwood DDX24BT is an in-dash navigation system with Bluetooth connectivity, much like the Joying JY-UL135N2, and easy-to-view navigation, much like the Pioneer AVIC-5200NEX.
