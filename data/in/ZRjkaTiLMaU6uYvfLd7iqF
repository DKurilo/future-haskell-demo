The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/hvac/best-baseboard-heaters/\">Baseboard Heaters</a> here.</em>","The Optimus baseboard heater is 30 inches in length, and unlike units that must be mounted to your baseboard, it is portable and includes a built-in carrying handle. This unit is ideal if you want to heat a small area of your home in an instant without having to install the unit on the wall.","Unlike baseboard heaters that require a wall thermostat, this Optimus baseboard heater includes a thermostat on the unit. It also has a digital display, two heat settings and a three-position function switch that includes off, low and high.","This baseboard space heater uses convection heating, and it has two heating capacities – 750 watts and 1,500 watts – unlike many baseboard heaters that can only run one. Instead of a front-vent system, this unit’s vent wraps from the front of the unit around the top, which allows more heat to disperse directly to the center of the room.","For safety, this electric baseboard heater has a tip-over safety switch, so you have peace of mind if it gets knocked over. The unit also has a power indicator light, which lets you know if it’s turned on or not. Additionally, the unit has an internal heat-limiting thermostat, which helps prevent the unit from overheating.","This heater weighs just 9 pounds, making it easy to move around your home. It is only available in white, though Optimus does make a similar electric baseboard heater in black. The unit is backed by a one-year warranty from the date of purchase and is guaranteed to be free from defect in material and workmanship under normal use.","Whether you are looking for an extra heating source for areas of your home or primary heating, the Optimus baseboard heater is an excellent option for heating small rooms like bedrooms or bathrooms. The unit can be left against a baseboard or moved from room to room. You also won&#39;t have to install the unit to a wall or deal with any wiring."]},"id":"f1c527b3-35d4-435e-88c6-10d413fdf290","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59230","url":"/optimus-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-03-27T03:44:30Z","datePublished":"2014-03-27T03:44:30Z","name":"Optimus H-3603","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-03-27T03:44:30Z","id":"ZRjkaTiLMaU6uYvfLd7iqF","meta":{"title":"Optimus H-3603 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Optimus baseboard space heater is light and can be moved from room to room easily, and it has an on-unit digital display thermostat."},"products":[{"slug":"optimus-h-3603","url":"/product/optimus-h-3603","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:41:01Z","name":"Optimus H-3603","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:41:01Z","id":"qPEduLCqikCPVyTqP3wwCB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T18:41:02Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/jUeVGuruaLTCjVbNFozBY4.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:41:01Z","mimeType":"","name":"59202-optimus-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/59202-optimus-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:41:01Z","id":"jUeVGuruaLTCjVbNFozBY4","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUeVGuruaLTCjVbNFozBY4.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Optimus H-3603 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Optimus baseboard space heater is light and can be moved from room to room easily, and it has an on-unit digital display thermostat."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/jUeVGuruaLTCjVbNFozBY4.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:41:01Z","mimeType":"","name":"59202-optimus-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/59202-optimus-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:41:01Z","id":"jUeVGuruaLTCjVbNFozBY4","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUeVGuruaLTCjVbNFozBY4.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Optimus H-3603 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Optimus baseboard space heater is light and can be moved from room to room easily, and it has an on-unit digital display thermostat."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/hvac/best-baseboard-heaters/optimus-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:41:01Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:41:01Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"heating","url":"/home-and-garden/heating","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:41:01Z","name":"Heating","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:41:01Z","id":"w2FSQ42CKbCcSiEPb5iBBm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
