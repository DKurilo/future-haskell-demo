You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Microsoft LifeCam Studio is the best HD <a href=\"/best-webcams\">webcam</a> in the LifeCam series. It offers high-definition resolution, interesting extra features and a convenient design that makes it simple to mount in multiple locations. However, there is one major flaw to this webcam that might be a deal breaker for some: It cannot natively film in full 1080p HD. Instead, you can either film in 720p or shoot images in 1080p. Also, it has one of the most frustrating autofocus features we&#39;ve seen. Still, the webcam mounts to any monitor and most televisions, and its base includes tripod compatibility. Also, it is easy to use and contains a full suite of interesting extra effects. For its design and simplicity, it is remarkable, but as an HD webcam the LifeCam Studio is somewhat frustrating.","The LifeCam Studio is capable of full 1080p high-definition resolution for still images, but for some reason, it can only film natively in 720p. On the one hand, this is fine if you are using a web chat platform like Skype or Google Hangouts, since these are displayed on smaller screens, but if you will be displayed on a television or projector, 720p doesn&#39;t cut it. When you are shooting images, you can take full 1080p pictures, and these images are excellent. If you&#39;re ready to step your selfie game up, the LifeCam Studio is an excellent and simple choice.","The webcam comes with an autofocus and light correction, but it is far more frustrating than most other cameras we reviewed. If you move even a little, the camera readjusts its focus and exposure. The focus seems to bounce in and out for a second while the camera tries to account for even slight movements. Once it&#39;s in focus, the image is crystal clear and beautiful, but getting there is incredibly frustrating.","One of the reasons that it constantly refocuses is because this camera offers incredible face-tracking abilities. It can identify your facial features and follow your eyes. In fact, it even offers some video effects that utilize this feature, such as facial distortion that actively distorts your facial features, even if you are moving your head. It&#39;s surprisingly fun to turn your head into a rectangle and watch it retain this shape as your tilt your head from side to side.","The camera features an excellent design with a flexible rubber base. You can attach the webcam to virtually any monitor or TV, and it can even attach to tripods, so you can use it as a camcorder. Microsoft supports the LifeCam Studio with a three-year warranty, and customer support is available by email. You can also get help through the user forums and FAQs or by downloading a new user manual."]},"id":"cb764ed9-ba9d-41a7-b670-a80691f004cd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d288f1e6-8ed2-4fc6-ace6-283a036a5ee9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Microsoft LifeCam Studio is an HD webcam with some excellent features and frustrating flaws.
