You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Marey&#39;s 16L Natural Gas Tankless Water Heater is a compact alternative to electric <a href=\"/best-water-heaters\">water heaters</a>. The electricity-free model is small enough to allow easy transportation and installation anywhere in your home. The engineering behind the Marey gas water heater permits it to only use gas while water is flowing, and it can heat an unlimited volume of water, up to 5.4 gallons per minute.","At 35 pounds, this 16-liter natural gas water heater isn&#39;t difficult to transport. It’s just under 22 inches tall and 14 inches wide, so you can store it in most cabinets. The Marey Power Water Heater requires two D batteries for operation, which aren’t included in the purchase price. The smaller unit makes for quick heating compared to some larger gas water heaters, even using battery power. It doesn’t require an electrical power source, like an electric water heater. Instead, it utilizes electric pulse ignition.","Both the natural gas and propane models include adjustable gas and water controls. The gas is only activated when the faucet is turned on. The manual setting can be touchy, so it might take some patience in getting it set up initially. The water heater is rust proof and leak resistant, and it features gas pressure protection and anti-combustion mechanisms so you don’t have to worry about pressure buildup and/or gas explosions. The unit should still work fine with limited water pressure. A flue duct handles the exhaust discharge, and a 1/2-inch gas supply line connects to your gas source.","The Marey 16L Tankless Water Heater is cheaper than competing models, so it&#39;s a good option if you&#39;re budget conscious. The manual adjustment option is a matter of preference, but you typically end up paying more for automatic settings. Installation isn’t quite as simple as some other models, and you might run into issues with connecting all the components. Marey offers a five-year limited parts and tank warranty. If you’re looking for a gas water heater on the low end of the price scale, this might suit your needs."]},"id":"21036879-5e25-4454-922e-c0ac2cb07b11","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62014","url":"/marey-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-30T20:28:15Z","datePublished":"2014-12-30T20:28:15Z","name":"Marey Tankless 16L NG ETL","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer fits our criteria.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer fits our criteria.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-12-30T20:28:15Z","id":"8tpN764b5jsjuXq3tX8fnk","meta":{"title":"Marey Tankless 16L NG ETL Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"This tankless water heater uses natural gas only when it needs it.
