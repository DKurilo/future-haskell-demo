You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Clearlane is an auto loan marketplace operated by Ally Financial. Clearlane is a broker, which means it does not provide loans, unlike <a href=\"/chase-review\">Chase</a> and <a href=\"/wells-fargo-review\">Wells Fargo</a> directly but connects you with financial institutions or local dealers willing to fund your auto purchase.","By using a broker like Clearlane, you can simplify the process of rate shopping. You’ll receive multiple offers with different rates or terms. To receive these offers you’ll need to sign up through Clearlane’s website. One advantage Clearlane offers is you don’t need to include your Social Security number when you apply, which means your credit won’t be affected.","After you fill out the form, a Clearlane loan consultant will contact you to go through your <a href=\"/best-auto-loan-services\">auto loan</a> options. You’ll submit the pre-qualified offer you accept to the lender for final processing. After applying you should receive offers within 24 hours.","The rates and terms of your loan will vary depending on the lender you choose. Other factors that can affect your loan include your credit score, the vehicle you choose and the mileage on it. Available terms range from 36 to 84 months, though we recommend avoiding auto loans with terms longer than 60 months.","If you want to get a clearer idea of how much your monthly payments will be, you can use the auto loan calculator on Clearlane’s site. It is one of the few calculators we used that allow you to see how your credit score can potentially affect your loan.","Since Clearlane is a broker, any additional documentation you&#39;ll be required to provide will be up to the lender you choose. Clearlane works with both financial institutions and local dealerships. Whether or not you&#39;ll be able to set up automatic payments depends on the lender you as well, but most financial institutions offer this service. You can set up an online account with Clearlane to monitor your application and track your offers.","Clearlane is among the best brokers we reviewed. This auto loan service works with both banks and dealers to match you with the best car loan."]},"id":"dfda4406-7872-45c0-a833-deed87c616ae","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59280","url":"/clearlane-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-03T17:45:23Z","datePublished":"2014-04-03T17:45:23Z","name":"Clearlane","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":45,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-04-03T17:45:23Z","id":"sRvskHNC6YUhvGSyv7ccNG","meta":{"title":"Clearlane Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Clearlane can preapprove you for an auto loan in 24 hours.
