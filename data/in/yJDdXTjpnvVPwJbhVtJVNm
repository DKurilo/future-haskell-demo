The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-remote-control-boats\">Remote Control Boats</a> here.</em>","The German Bismarck Military Battleship is a model warship built on a 1/360 scale, so it&#39;s hardly a racing boat. As such, this remote control boat is a hobbyist’s dream, and whether you’re 5 or 50, you&#39;ll enjoy spending time with this beauty. The immensely intricate details on the boat&#39;s surface include all the turrets, anchors and masts you&#39;d see on the real military battleship. Kids will thrill to the high adventure of navigating the warship into enemy territory, while adults will enjoy unwinding to a gentle cruise through still waters.","This RC boat&#39;s speed ranges from 5 to 10 miles per hour, which makes it ideal for a leisurely voyage on a lake, pond or even down a river. It has a small operating distance of 120 feet. This is the smallest operating range we saw on an RC boat, but since this isn&#39;t a boat you can drive quickly, 120 feet should not be too limiting.","The details on this radio controlled boat are excellent. As a replica of a warship, the boat has many small details and features. At 28 inches long, it&#39;s well suited for bodies of water of various sizes.","This RC electric boat features dual propellers that offer fantastic maneuverability. The run time on the German Bismarck Military Battleship is approximately 15 minutes, which is one of the shortest run times we saw for a RC boat. This is not much time to spend floating your RC boat on the water.","The German Bismarck Military Battleship comes with a display stand so that those who simply want to add this warship replica to their boat collection can do so. Otherwise, it also comes with a transmitter, batteries and a wall charger to power this RC boat and get it out on the water in no time. However, we are disappointed that this RC battleship does not come with extra propellers, which would be welcomed, particularly if younger children wanted to enjoy the boat.","There is no warranty information for this remote control boat online, which is a drawback. There are no other online resources such as a user manual or even YouTube videos, which would provide a glimpse into the boat&#39;s performance before you spend money on it. However, we did come across a few customer reviews online that could help you determine if the German Bismarck Military Battleship has the performance and the quality you need to add it to your collection."]},"id":"7ab869b9-59b3-45fc-98ce-d0713f7b8647","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c4157c55-e41c-48ca-af38-44a4d470bc93","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["No matter what your age may be, you are sure to enjoy this boat built for leisurely tours across whatever still body of water is nearest to you.
