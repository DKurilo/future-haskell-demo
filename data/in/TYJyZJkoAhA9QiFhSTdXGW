The base configuration comes with a 3rd generation Intel i3 processor. For additional computing power you can upgrade up to a third generation Intel i7 chip. This does provide decent processor speeds, between 3.3-3.4GHz, but these chips are a full generation behind the last processors that Intel offers. The computer does have integrated 802.11n Wi-Fi. This is good for placing the computer in the house where you want it without being limited by hardwiring into a modem. You can also access peripherals like printers and hard drives through a network as well without physically connecting to the desktop pc. Unlike other similar pcs with wireless technology there is no Bluetooth included, limiting the number of devise you can access wirelessly.","The base desktop PC comes with a 2TB hard drive, which will give you enough room for your music library and photos, and you should only need more storage if you have a large number of video and movie files. The lower disk speed of 5,400 rpm gives you a noticeably slower transfer rate than the 7,200 rpm hard drives found in similar home computers. You can upgrade the configuration of the Asus CM to include up to a 4TB 7,200 rpm hard drive. There is an open slot for another hard drive to be installed, but Asus CM offers only a single hard drive for purchase.","There is an option for dual optical drives with this PC. The base optical configuration is a single DVD burner, but you may upgrade and add a second optical drive that is a Blu-ray player. Adding a Blu-ray player to your computer is great if you want to use your home computer as a media center. The Asus CM has an HMDI output, allowing you to connect your computer to HD televisions and get the maximum picture quality.","The Asus CM comes with a one-year limited warranty. This warranty only covers manufacturer&#39;s defects. If you would like further protection, you can purchase an extended warranty from Asus, but the company only offers one additional year, which is far less than other manufacturers offer for home computers. Asus provides phone, email and live chat support for questions you may have about the computer. There is also a driver download library for hardware assistance with components in your computer tower."]},"id":"abd4be5c-2ebd-4691-80c1-ccda0ed41fdb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"79345c40-c831-4f2d-b304-eb6f51925941","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Asus CM provides basic computing power, but you can upgrade the system with multiple purchasable configurations and additional expansion slots for post-purchase additions.
