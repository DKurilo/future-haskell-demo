You can adjust the handle for trimming and edging. This gas <a href=\"/best-weed-whackers\">weed eater</a> is equipped with a 25cc two-cycle engine, so you would think this straight-shaft trimmer has the power to whip through weeds without difficulty. Unfortunately, our testing did not bear this out, and this well-known product displayed a few serious drawbacks. The Weed Eater W25SFK made quick work of soft grass but did a poor job cutting thick weeds. It also lacked the strength to slice through small trees and branches that some of the best string trimmers, like the <a href=\"/toro-straight-shaft-gas-trimmer-review\">Toro 51978</a> cut down easily.","In addition, in our tests, the trimmer did not start immediately, and on the second day of testing, we encountered problems once again starting this string trimmer. It also stalled three times during the testing intervals, at one point shutting down completely.","Unlike the best weed whackers, this string trimmer does not have anti-vibration technology built into its design to protect you from muscle strain. Like all tools that vibrate as they work, such as leaf blowers and weed eaters, if you must use one that vibrates, it is wise to take repeated breaks to protect your muscles. Prolonged use of a vibrating tool poses an increased risk of developing HAVS (hand-arm vibration syndrome), which can be painful and may cause permanent damage.","Weed Eater offers a two-year warranty for parts and labor and a two-year warranty on the drive shaft. If you run into difficulties, you can use the online user manual, or you can call or email the manufacturer. In addition, there are numerous Weed Eater service centers throughout the U.S. where you can get parts or have your trimmer repaired."]},"id":"46eed2fa-336b-41ec-982e-e1b1eac553fc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8516708e-1849-44e3-a08a-dd75ff625778","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We experienced a lot of issues with this trimmer including its tendency to stall, its troubles starting, and its lack of vibration protection prevents it from competing with the best trimmers in our lineup.
