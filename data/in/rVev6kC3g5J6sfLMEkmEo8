The original review is below, but check out our current</em><i> </i><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/money/tax/best-online-tax-software/\"><em>Online Tax Software Reviews</em></a><i> </i><em>here.</em>","<em>Editor&#39;s Note: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reports that the latest tax forms for the 2015 tax season will be released January 19, 2016. Online tax software services will not have access to those forms until the release date. While you may be able to prepare your return in advance, you cannot e-file until the forms are released and the IRS is accepting returns. While we have performed our preliminary tests, we cannot fully test the services and rank the products until all services are available for testing. We will update our reviews through the tax season as the newest versions are released.</em>","ezTaxReturn provides online tax e-filing services for submitting simple 1040EZs and 1040s, including 1040s with self-employment income. Using this service, customers are charged a flat rate for federal and state returns, regardless of which forms are required. The fees are simply $29.95 for federal and $19.95 for state returns. This service also provides paper copies of your returns for an additional fee ($19.95-34.95). ezTaxReturn also provides (for a fee) audit defense and amended return insurance. Refund payment options include direct deposit or pre-paid debit card. Fees can be deducted from the refund amount.","This tax return software is similar to most of its competitors. It provides a guided or do-it-yourself option so you can use their assistance or move through the forms quickly if you already know what you need to do. Though it provides a guided option, it does not offer life-change questions. For example, it will give you the option of claiming dependents but it does not ask questions such as, “Did you have a baby this year?” or, “Did you buy a house this year?” These types of life-event questions help those who do not know what deductions, income or credits they might be required to claim. Because it does not include the life-change option, it is most suitable for simple returns or to those who are somewhat aware of tax law as it pertains to them.","When reviewing this tax software we found it to be quite similar to other mid-range products. One irritation we noticed is that it doesn’t allow you to skip sections. For example, maybe you do not have all of your information yet for a certain section but you want to get your returns started and completed as far as possible until you have everything collected. Most software will let you jump around to different sections and come back to sections later but this software stopped us and requested the missing information. So, if you choose to use ezTaxReturn you will want to make sure you have all of your information gathered first.","It always makes us a little concerned when we cannot find a telephone number posted for a service site. The only contact information listed online is an email link. We contacted this service several times via email and they responded with relevant information within an hour on all occasions. However, telephone support does not appear to be readily available. When logged in to our account we also could not find a telephone contact number nor chat support option. Online tax information is also limited to some tax tips and FAQs."]},"id":"67f6c90d-5dc9-4875-ad14-e8ae820ee728","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8a6685c5-5f35-4b55-b9fc-9c30d765b803","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This the first year we have reviewed this specific tax service.
