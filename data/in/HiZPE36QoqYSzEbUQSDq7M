But not all businesses operate on this simple model. Longer business hours, more employees, peak hours and holiday hours can all be factors for concern. This is where <a href=\"/money/small-business\">employee scheduling software</a> can come to the rescue. Here are some of the most common employee scheduling issues that a scheduling tool can help with.","<strong>Employee Turnover</strong><br/>For businesses that don t simply operate on an 8-to-5 schedule, employee turnover can be an incredible headache. You just hired a new employee and have finally gotten used to their shift schedule when suddenly someone else quits and throws off your entire rhythm. Then you suddenly have to find ways to cover their shifts with now depleted resources without giving employees overtime. The eternal juggling of shifts can quickly become one of the most time consuming task you have to deal with."]},"id":"5590c11f-e23d-423d-bb9b-15bea74a522d","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Uncommon Shift Rotations</strong><br/>Some business models include unusual shift rotations that can easily throw kinks into employee scheduling efforts. Employees may be working every other hour depending on your services or performing monthly rotations to remote areas. Without the right tools, the accompanying complications can easily overburden and confuse both workers and HR managers.","<strong>Split Schedules</strong><br/>There may be spans of time when an employee doesn t need to work during the day. For example, you might give an employee four hours of work and then three hours of downtime before they need to come back for another four hours of work. These aren t terribly convenient for employees since they end up commuting more. Tracking split schedules is something of a headache too. If you find yourself having to track multiple shifts for the same person in one day, your job could be even more of a nightmare.","<strong>Shift Changes</strong><br/>Things happen at the last minute which may prevent an employee from fulfilling their upcoming shift. An employee may arrange for someone else to work their shift or just not show up and leave you in a bad position. Then you have to make changes to the schedule to make sure that the employee who picked up the shift isn t going into overtime with their current schedules, communicate the changes with management and so on.","<strong>Holidays</strong><br/>Let s be honest, no one wants to be working for the holidays. We all have places we d rather be, which makes it all the harder to find individuals willing to make the sacrifice and work. Scheduling becomes an absolute mess, and it&#39;s vital that you keep the schedule organized with all the irregular schedule changes.","<strong>Seniority</strong><br/>For employees who have worked there longest, it s not uncommon for them to feel more entitled to the best shifts. It then becomes more difficult to schedule employees who are newer and might therefore have more conflicting schedules. Finding a balance between giving senior members some leeway while also making concessions for newer employees is difficult to achieve without the right organizational tools.","Employee scheduling software can certainly help reduce the headache involved in coordinating shift schedules. If you can address the root causes of scheduling issues, you will suddenly find the task of scheduling becomes so much easier. Scheduling programs track not only employee schedules, but attendance trends, shift swaps and more. You don t have to endure this alone with an Excel spreadsheet. These applications are much more useful than you d think.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "]},"id":"75341516-b0f1-41e6-9243-08588b5459e0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5709","url":"/common-issues-with-workforce-scheduling","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"ryan-goodrich","url":"/author/ryan-goodrich","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Ryan Goodrich","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"JiyjX3p6rgLpyZFxn2y77n","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-04-05T14:02:55Z","datePublished":"2011-04-05T14:02:55Z","name":"Common Issues with Workforce Scheduling","synopsis":"For some 8-to-5 businesses, scheduling employees is simple since everyone works the same schedule.
