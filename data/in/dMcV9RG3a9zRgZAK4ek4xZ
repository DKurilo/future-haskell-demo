It offers a high level of air circulation while maintaining an exceptional level of energy efficiency for lower long-term cost to you. In addition, it comes with a beautiful and modern chrome metal finish that will propel your home into a more modern and contemporary look. Unfortunately, the warranty doesn&#39;t really hold up compared to most other ceiling fans brands.","With a 48-inch diameter, this is one of the best ceiling fans with lights due to its level of operation. At its highest speed, the fan circulates 6,556 cubic feet of air per minute. It utilizes 72.8 watts of electricity to achieve an efficiency rating of nearly 81 cubic feet per minute per watt. This makes it among the more energy-efficient of fans for its size range, even when factoring in electricity consumption with the lighting kit.","This is one of the top ceiling fans due to its high-quality manufacturing, but the entire fan is covered by a 15-year limited warranty, which means you can replace individual parts or the entire motor at little or no cost. This warranty is much shorter than the lifetime coverage offered by other brands such as <a href=\"/hunter-palermo-review\">Hunter</a> and <a href=\"/fanimation-review\">Fanimation</a>. Additionally, while looking into the warranty options offered by Litex, we found that the company doesn&#39;t have a working website and the only way to contact them is over the phone.","The body of the fan is designed with a sleek chrome metal finish, which contributes further to an overall quiet motor performance. Interestingly, this fan has four metal blades, which add to its chrome finish and set it apart from other ceiling fans that have wood or plastic blades.","The vertical footprint of this quiet ceiling fan from ceiling to the bottom of the light kit glass is 19 inches, which is among the more sizable dimensions. It is only designed for installation with a six-inch downrod mounting kit, without the availability of a flush mounting kit available, even through the manufacturer. Despite this design, the fan creates very little wobbling when securely mounted, even at the highest fan speeds."]},"id":"90daad3a-0527-49d7-9709-d2ce0699cba3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66306","url":"/litex-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-22T17:05:16Z","datePublished":"2015-07-22T17:05:16Z","name":"Litex Urbana E-UB48BC4C1","synopsis":"The Litex E-UB48BC4C1 Urbana is a ceiling fan designed for both long-term usage and efficiency.
