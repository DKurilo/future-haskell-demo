Granted, that number is important – after all, if an updater can&#39;t find outdated drivers, it&#39;s not doing its job. But more important is the value of those drivers. Device Doctor found made a number of update recommendations in our test scan, but it missed too many critical drivers to be worth its asking price.","We identified 36 outdated drivers on our test machine before running each driver finder through its paces. When we tested Device Doctor, it found 24 of those 36 drivers. This may not be a high percentage, but it&#39;s impressive nonetheless; our pick for best driver updater found the same number of drivers in its own scans. However, while Device Doctor found a decent number of outdated drivers, the ones it spotted were for peripherals and USB connectors, rather than the drivers that maintain the overall integrity of the computer.","For example, Device Doctor found updates for our test PC&#39;s Ethernet controller, which maintains its connection to the internet. However, it missed many equally critical updates, including drivers for the graphics card, the audio card and the hard drive controllers. If you have a problem with your graphic card&#39;s driver, it could keep your monitor from displaying an image. A problem with the hard drive controller could prevent your computer from booting into Windows.","When Device Doctor identifies a driver in need of updates, it doesn&#39;t let you know what version of the driver you&#39;re currently running, or what version it recommends you replace that driver with. You have to take the program&#39;s word that its suggestions are right for your system."]},"id":"aca303b2-ee71-448d-abb2-6734a17496cc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6781bc8e-f349-439a-8563-a24bfc228f82","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are a few other issues with Device Doctor that hold it back from getting our recommendation – for example, it bundles malware with its installer – but its lack of effective driver suggestions is its biggest shortcoming.
