He suggests using audio editing software with multitrack recording capabilities because recording each mic separately saves time in the post-production process and results in a cleaner, more cohesive product.","He also suggests taking a little extra time before you start recording to make sure microphone levels are correct. “If it&#39;s a bad recording, it&#39;s a bad recording. It can be cleaned up, but it will never sound as good as if it was a clean recording to begin with.” He likens the process to taking a bad photograph and relying on software to fix it, noting, “editing software can only put so much lipstick on the pig.”<br/>","<strong>Important Features to Consider </strong>","Recording Capability<br/>Some audio editing software can only edit files. If you plan to record your voice for a podcast, make sure you choose a program that can record from a USB microphone or audio interface. Some of the programs we reviewed can record multiple sources simultaneously, known as multitrack recording. This is a handy feature for podcast producers who use more than one microphone, and it allows you to edit those tracks separately.<br/><br/> Editing Tools and Effects<br/>All the programs we tested can handle simple editing tasks like fade-ins and fade-outs, volume normalization, and copying and pasting. However, the best programs include advanced tools that apply fun effects like delay, echo and pitch-shifting. They also have mastering effects so you can publish your results at industry-standard volume levels for online and physical distribution.<br/><br/> Track Count<br/>All the programs we tested allow you to record audio, but only about half of them can record more than two tracks per session. The best programs we tested support more than 20 tracks per session. If you plan to record more than one mic and integrate other audio content, such as beat-beds and sound effects, the post-production process is much easier if each source is on its own track.","<strong>How Much Should I Spend on Audio Editing Software? </strong>","The only reason to spend more than $100 on editing software is if you plan to compose music with virtual instruments, produce complex arrangements or mix and master recordings professionally. We recommend $200 as the right price for music production software, and $500 or more if you are recording and finalizing projects in a professional capacity. The programs we tested for this comparison are the perfect solution for recording podcasts, editing and repairing field recordings and digitizing an old vinyl collection.","<strong>Best USB Microphones </strong>","Other than audio editing software, the most important piece of gear you need to produce a podcast is a microphone. USB microphones offer the easiest setup process and don’t require an audio interface to communicate with software. If you plan to record with multiple microphones simultaneously, an audio interface is a better option. But if you need to record only one source at a time, here are a couple of our favorite USB microphones:","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blue-1967-Condenser-Microphone-Multipattern/dp/B004L9KLT6\">Blue Yeti Pro</a><br/>The Blue Yeti Pro is the most versatile USB microphone available. It has a USB output to connect directly to your laptop or home computer, as well as a standard XLR output to send an analog signal to a recording interface. It’s compatible with all of the audio editing software we tested, and it comes with a heavy-duty tabletop stand. It has three polar patterns, including an omnidirectional setting for picking up voices 360 degrees around the mic. The zero-latency headphone output and gain control allow you to dial in the perfect levels while eliminating the annoying delay associated with using your computer’s sound card as the output device.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-AT2020USB-Cardioid-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B00B5ZX9FM\">Audio-Technica AT2020USB+</a><br/>If you’re looking for a USB mic for less than $200, the Audio-Technica AT2020USB+ is the best option. Audio-Technica is well-known for producing some of the best recording mics available, and the AT2020USB+ is a best-in-class option for USB mics. It has an internal headphone amp with volume control and a well-designed A/D converter that records at 16 bits, which is CD quality. It comes with a tripod desktop stand, a USB cable and a padded pouch."]},"id":"3b153af3-06dd-4280-a116-fc84c5d990f0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"9605eafd-3fa2-4385-a0ec-c8a379148bd4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/audacity-review\">Audacity</a>","<a href=\"/adobe-audition-review\">Adobe Audition</a>","<a href=\"/acoustica-digital-audio-editor-review\">Acoustica</a>","<a href=\"/magix-audio-cleaning-lab-review\">MAGIX Audio Cleaning Lab</a>","<a href=\"/wavepad-review\">WavePad</a>","<a href=\"/sound-forge-review\">Magix Sound Forge Audio Studio</a>","<a href=\"/cockos-review\">Cockos Reaper</a>","<a href=\"/sound-studio-review\">Sound Studio</a>","<a href=\"/wavelab-review\">WaveLab Elements</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"7fd88653-e9a9-4df3-9dc6-cec3f627293e","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_106","url":"/best-audio-editing-software","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-18T21:41:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-18T21:41:00Z","name":"Best Audio Editing Software of 2019","synopsis":"We tested the noise reduction capabilities, file compatibility and editing tools of 15 audio editing programs that cost less than $100.","review":{},"strapline":"We tested the noise reduction capabilities, file compatibility and editing tools of 15 audio editing programs that cost less than $100.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-24T21:33:08Z","id":"R4VoK6HVrLiBBWbBRUuQT9","meta":{"title":"Best Audio Editing Software 2019 -
