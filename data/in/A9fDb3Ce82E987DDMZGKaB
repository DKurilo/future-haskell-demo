Personal firewall software acts like a gatekeeper for a single device and gives you lots of ways to customize your security settings.   ","Personal firewalls keep sensitive information from leaving your computer and stop unauthorized apps from sneaking onto your computer. This is especially important when you connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot since public internet services don’t have a network firewall like your home network does, making you more susceptible to hackers, ransomware and other threats.","Good personal firewall software also detects when someone is piggybacking on or stealing your internet connection. When this happens, your connection speeds slow down substantially, so detecting and severing this activity is helpful.","<strong>Do I Need Firewall Software?</strong>","While both Windows and Mac operating systems come with a built-in firewall, third-party tests show  they don’t protect quite as well as third-party software. The good thing about firewall software is it works alongside your operating system to give you a double layer of protection and catch anything the first firewall may miss. Also, these programs come with other security features, such as antivirus tools, safe banking tools, vulnerability scans and parental controls.","Don’t Wait!<br/>Don’t put off buying an internet security solution until after your system is hacked. While firewall and antivirus programs are excellent at preventing an attack, they can’t always clean your system once malware infects it. When this happens, you need to be pretty tech savvy to get everything off. We suggest taking your computer to a reputable computer geek to help you restore your system. Once clean, you can then install firewall protection and keep future attacks from happening.","Firewall Routers<br/>There are new devices popping up, such as the Bitdefender BOX and the Norton CORE. These network firewalls connect to your router and protect your whole network, and every device connected to it, from a single point. This means you don’t have to download security software to your devices, freeing up room and valuable resources. However, when we tested firewall routers, the consensus was that they aren’t simple enough for average consumers to use just yet. They require a level of tech savvy. In our tests, they proved difficult to set up and required us to change IP addresses, resulting in lost internet connection for several hours. We ultimately needed our internet provider’s support team to help get the connection back. The concept is great, but unless you are very tech minded, you’ll probably be best served by software instead. We’ll be keeping a close eye on developments and testing future versions.","<strong>How much does a personal firewall cost?</strong>","Your operating system most likely came with a firewall, but it’s always a good idea to have a second layer of protection. We suggest purchasing an antivirus program for internet security that includes a personal firewall for $30 to $50.
