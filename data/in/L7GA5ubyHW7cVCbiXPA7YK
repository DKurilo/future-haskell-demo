We spent dozens of hours researching the best belt sanders on the market today, comparing specs, surveying regular users and consulting professionals to see exactly what to look for in a belt sander. The manufacturers have no input on our testing methodology, and results of our evaluations are not provided to manufacturers in advance of publication. Although Top Ten Reviews may make money from sales that originate from our reviews, every product was reviewed from an objective standpoint.  ","<strong>How We Picked the Best</strong>","<br/>Top Ten Reviews has been researching, evaluating and reviewing the best belt sanders since 2014. Our team of expert reviewers spent dozens of hours searching for the best belt sanders available. We considered hundreds of models, looking at power, versatility, durability and more, and we chose models based on features such as motor power, size, weight, balance, durability and versatility. At the end of our analysis, we picked models that are well-rounded, not necessarily the most powerful, most expensive or top-of-the-line products. Instead, we chose tools that hit all the bases the best. ","<strong>How Much Do Belt Sanders Cost?</strong>","The belt sanders we evaluated cost an average of $135, but we recommend you invest in an extra sanding belt if you use your belt sander frequently. The price of replacement belts vary by the size and grit but generally don’t cost too much. We found 10 packs available online for about $20.","<strong>Important Features to Look For</strong>","When you pick the best belt sander for you, keep the following aspects in mind.","Uses<br/>Belt sanders have several practical uses. They’re great not only for priming and finishing wood and metal surfaces, but also trimming, leveling, shaping and smoothing rough surfaces. The best belt sanders will remove paint, and stain finishes. Additionally, the most versatile models work on metal to remove rust and paint.  ","Size<br/>The biggest, most powerful belt sander isn’t always the right choice. Consider what you’ll be using the tool for and how often. Large, heavy, hefty sanders are great for professionals, but a more lightweight, compact model would be better for your average home tool set. Big, bulky tools require more space to store and more regular maintenance to perform.","Features<br/>All belt sanders come with a standard array of features such as dust bags, manual or automatic tracking, and more, but the best belt sanders go beyond that. Some unique features we encountered were a pressure control system that indicates when you’re applying the ideal amount of force and a clear window that shows you exactly where you’re going. And some models offer ways to make it easier to change and adjust your belt, from things such as simple levers to an auto-tracking feature.","Price<br/>The best belt sanders can be expensive. Our top choice, the <a href=\"/makita-review\">Makita 9903</a>, costs more than $200. And while you get your money’s worth out of it, depending on how often you’ll use it, and the scope of your projects, you may not need to shell out that much cash. In contrast, you can pick up the <a href=\"/skil-review\">Skil 7510-01</a> for less than $50. It produces similar results for most projects. If you’re not going to use a sander very often, or just want one around the house for those “just in case” situations, a less-expensive model will probably fit your needs. ","<br/><strong>More Power Tool Guides:</strong>"]},"id":"440bc7be-54ef-4b07-a913-cf1e640acbce","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-chainsaws\">The Best Chainsaws</a>","<a href=\"/best-circular-saws\">The Best Circular Saws</a>","<a href=\"/best-miter-saws\">The Best Miter Saws</a>","<a href=\"/best-cordless-drills\">The Best Cordless Drills</a>","<a href=\"/best-palm-routers\">The Best Palm Routers</a>","<a href=\"/best-laser-line-levels\">The Best Laser Line Levels</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"45d995dd-c246-4e16-b184-d063108e1d8d","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_35","url":"/best-belt-sanders","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
