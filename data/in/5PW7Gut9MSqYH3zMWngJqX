Among the variety of consoles available for your living room, the newest trend is the micro-console, a smaller device with access to digital distribution services. The Mad Catz M.O.J.O. is the best of all of the micro-consoles available, giving you access to a variety of Android stores. It has strong capabilities, but it is among the most difficult consoles to use. It requires some special setup, which can be daunting and confusing. If you root the system, however, you will have access to most apps and games.","Out of the box, the M.O.J.O. allows you to access the Google Play Store, NVIDIA’s TegraZone (which links back to Google Play for actual purchases), Amazon Apps, OnLive and Ouya. With this wide variety of digital distributors available on one console, you’d expect to have access to thousands of games and apps. Unfortunately, Ouya is the only store with full functionality. OnLive is limited out of the box, and the majority of the games on the Android stores are incompatible with the micro-console.","If you go to the Google Play Store and try to download a game, the store will say that the game is incompatible with your phone, even though the M.O.J.O. is not a phone. Even games with controller support are listed as incompatible. To work around this, Mad Catz offers support for helping you root your system, a process of hacking the system to change its settings. Rooting takes time, and while the step-by-step instructions are easy for many, it is a needlessly intimidating addition to setting up your new console.","The M.O.J.O. comes with a C.T.R.L.r gamepad and a variety of adapters. One of the more interesting adapters is a travel clip, which allows you to attach your phone to the gamepad and use both as a mobile gaming device. This is a nice addition to the console to make it a little more accessible to all users."]},"id":"e7f3b5b5-2926-48ad-8445-8299e3eeb8a1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a8df6b09-f01a-4908-b386-70045e906b02","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Mad Catz M.O.J.O. is the best micro-console available, giving you access to a variety of Android-based app stores, but in order to get full functionality out of your console, you’ll have to hack it.
