Radenso Pro M-Edition is a GPS <a href=\"/best-radar-detectors\">radar detector</a> marketed to enthusiasts with boasts of extreme range and MultaRadar detection. In fact, the Pro M-Edition is one of the few devices capable of detecting MultaRadar, a type of low-level K-band frequency primarily used in Canada for photo radar detecting. That said, MultaRadar is starting to show up in parts of the U.S., so it&#39;s a detection feature to keep an eye on. In my tests, the Pro M-Edition proved to be very good, but the range wasn&#39;t nearly as extreme as it suggests. And the ease of use isn’t great.","In the highway tests, the Pro M-Edition earned a B for range resulting from mid-pack detection range. While aiming the radar gun down a long road, it detected the radar at over two miles. With a radar gun aimed up a hill in the road, the range was just short of a mile. Only the <a href=\"/escort-redline-review\">Escort Redline EX</a> and the <a href=\"/valentine-one-radar-detectors-review\">Valentine One</a> had longer ranges in that test. The biggest reason why it didn&#39;t get an A grade was the 0.4-mile range with the radar gun aimed perpendicularly to the road. The Escort Max 360c and <a href=\"/escort-passport-max-review\">Escort Passport IX</a> were longer by a tenth of a mile. And the RedLine EX was over a quarter of a mile better. Still, with all that in mind, the range that the Pro M-Edition is still very good compared to other detectors I tested. It provides ample time to slow down if you&#39;re speeding.","The city performance received a B+ mark, which means it had a good, though not elite, balance of detecting radar but not becoming so noisy that you want to turn it off. In the AutoCity mode, the GPS mutes all alerts when you&#39;re driving below a specific speed. This helps keep it from becoming a squawk box and ruining the quality of your drive, but it&#39;s not as effective as the Escort&#39;s auto sensitivity setting, which also provides visual alerts to radar.","The ease of use is the biggest disappointment with the Pro M-edition, earning it a B- grade. It only has three buttons. Each button has multiple functions, which means you must read the instructions to understand how to effectively access the secondary functions of buttons which aren&#39;t clearly labeled. Other than the power symbol, none of the symbols has much in common with the controls on standard detectors. Novice users can grasp how to use this detector, but not straight out of the box. It has a steeper learning curve than most detectors.","The Pro M-Edition&#39;s GPS measures your speed and it tells you what direction you&#39;re driving. When you receive an alert and your eyes turn to the detector&#39;s display, you&#39;ll see your speed, raising your awareness. And, as mentioned, the GPS helps mute radar alerts when you&#39;re driving under a selected speed limit. It doesn&#39;t, however have an over-speed alert to notify you when you&#39;ve exceed a selected speed, which is best way to avoid a speeding ticket.","The construction of this detector feels disappointingly cheap. The feel and overall construction didn&#39;t play a role in how I ranked the radar detectors, but you can certainly feel the difference between the quality of the $500 to $700 detectors and the $100 to $400 detectors. This detector doesn&#39;t feel like a $550 device. The plastic is flimsy and cheap. The display is boring and dated."]},"id":"b0ecbd7c-0a96-4667-a26c-7304042071a0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"bee5fcb2-0716-4c80-8bbe-3d93305449b6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Radenso Pro M-edition performed well enough in the tests to emerge as one of the best radar detectors.
