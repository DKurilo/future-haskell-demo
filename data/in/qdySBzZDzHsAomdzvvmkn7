Over the years, we have invested more than 120 hours weighing the pros and cons of various features. We researched popular manufacturers to find the top 10 top-load washers for making laundry more convenient.","We also interviewed experts to help us understand what makes a good top-load washing machine and whether or not to buy one. Industry experts, and a multitude of testing data, indicate that front-load washers are more efficient and better at cleaning than top-load machines, but people still buy top-loaders.","&#34;It&#39;s just hard to change people&#39;s minds,&#34; said James Peters, Product Manager at Kenmore.","“It comes down to consumer preference,” wrote Edward Crump, Brand &amp; Product Marketing Manager for Frigidaire, in an email response, “even though front-load machines save space and typically offer better cleaning and more energy efficiency.”","“Early bad experiences with front-loaders – with vibration or mildew – gave them a bad reputation, so people shy away from them,” said Peters. Modern designs do a lot to combat those problems, but the bad impression remains for a lot of shoppers. And buying a top-load machine is not a bad thing. They may not be as energy efficient as front-load machines or quite as good at cleaning, but they are getting close, and companies like Kenmore make top- and front-loading machines. &#34;We&#39;ve improved top-loaders a lot,&#34; said Peters.","Most top-loaders no longer have a central agitator, so they offer a lot more capacity, and that is a definite advantage for larger households. Top-loaders also offer more choices in the number of cycles and settings they have now. “That&#39;s actually one of the things people get wrong most often,” said Peters. “They use the normal cycle all the time. You&#39;re not getting the most out of your machine if you constantly use the normal setting. The preset cycles have been carefully orchestrated by designers to get the best temperature, spin speed, soil level and other settings so that different types of clothing will get as clean as possible. It is worth it to make use of the other cycle types.” That goes for front- and top-load machines.","Proper maintenance, including regular tub cleaning, is also important for getting the most out of both top- and front-loaders.","<strong>How We Researched</strong>","We researched online stores, as well as brick-and-mortar retailers, to get a feel for the best features for top-load washing machines. We spoke to customer service representatives and scoured product manuals to determine what you can expect from the best top-load washers. We also read customer and professional reviews to suss out the features that matter for these appliances. We looked for products that have a good reputation with professional reviewers and customers to ensure you get what you expect. Additionally, we built detailed charts to document and organize each washer and its features. We check back and update  regularly as well, to make sure we have included the best washing machines on the market.","<strong>How Much Does a Top-Load Washing Machine Cost?<br/></strong>","We compared top-load washing machines that ranged in price from $400 to $1,000, but there are machines that fall outside of that price range, too. At the upper end you have the more modern designs without a central agitator, which allows more room for large loads. They also offer things like digital controls and Wi-Fi connectivity. Additionally, most units at the more expensive end are more energy efficient than the cheaper units. The lower end of that price range offers machines that look a lot like the ones used in the 80s and 90s, with manual dials and central agitators. They use more power and water than the expensive machines, but they do clean clothes and might work just fine if you are worried about your budget.","<strong>What Size Washer Do I Need for a King-size Comforter?</strong>","If you are ready to replace your old washing machine, you may be looking for something large enough to handle bulkier loads. If you buy the right size washer, you can avoid having to take your king-size comforter to the laundromat. However, there is some debate on what the right size is.","Theoretically, any machine over 3.8 cubic feet should be able to handle a king-size comforter, but a few cleaning experts say you should look for a washer with at least 4.5 cubic feet. We think even that is a little low, depending on your comforter. While really bulky comforters may fit in a 4.5-cubic-foot machine, they don&#39;t have enough room to move and get clean.","After a lot of testing, Kenmore has established a slightly different standard. According to Peters, any machine over 4.5 cubic feet can clean a queen-size bedding set – comforter, sheets and pillow cases. Any machine over 5.2 cubic feet can handle a king-size bedding set.","This can vary slightly, depending on the type of comforter you have, though. Thinner bedding might be just fine in a smaller machine. However, we recommend you get a machine with at least 4.5 cubic feet if you want to wash king-size bedding and an even bigger machine if you have a bulky comforter.","<strong>How Long Do Washers Last?</strong>","According to a 2007 National Association of Home Builders/Bank of America Home Equity study, which offered estimates on different appliances&#39; lifespans, you can expect to get about 10 years out of your top-load washer. The way you use your washer, initial craftsmanship and maintenance can all impact whether or not your machine makes it to the 10-year mark.","It’s also important to research your washer thoroughly before you buy it, as some brands are going to be more dependable and last longer than others. Richard Spencer, owner of Utah-based Mark-A-Newt Appliance Specialists, has been repairing appliances for more than 40 years. He highly recommends Speed Queen as a reliable brand because he so rarely works on them. He said Whirlpool and Maytag also are great for dependability.","In many cases, you will want to replace your washer and dryer long before they actually wear out., however There are new technologies and styles being released all of the time.","<strong>What To Look For in a Top-Load Washer</strong>","Energy Cost &amp; Efficiency<br/>Just about any new top-load washer will be more efficient than the preceding generation of machines, but it is worth researching specifics to get more efficient models. Get the smallest unit that will accommodate your laundry needs, because the smaller units naturally cost less to run. Check for the U.S. Department of Energy&#39;s yellow label, which is easy to find online or in the store. That will tell you how much you can expect to pay annually in energy costs for each machine. ","Wash Cycles &amp; Options<br/>Generally, the more cycles you have, the better, but it is worth noting the types of available cycles too, to determine if they meet your needs. Look for a sanitize cycle if you know you will be using cloth diapers, for instance.","Design &amp; Dimensions<br/>If you are looking at top-load units, you are probably not terribly worried about space. Top-loading washers and dryers typically take up more space in your laundry room than front-loading units because they can’t be stacked. But it is still worth measuring your space before shopping. You don&#39;t want to end up with a washer and dryer that take up so much space that they make your laundry room feel cramped.","<strong>How Full Should a Top-Load Washer Be?</strong>","Fill the tub no more than about 2/3 of the way up for the best results. It may be tempting to make use of the entire wash tub, but that can strain the motor. Also, if you overfill your machine, your clothes may come out still soiled,  because part of what cleans your clothes in a top-load machine is the items colliding with one another and the agitator. If the load is too full, everything will just sit there in one, dense lump.","The manuals for many of the washers we compared aren&#39;t very specific in their filling instructions. They mostly just advise against overfilling. For traditional top-load washers, that means you shouldn’t fill it past the agitator, and you don&#39;t want to pack the items too tightly either. However, the 2/3 of the way full we recommend is below the top of the agitator. Most modern top-load machines don&#39;t have agitators.

Even older machines can safely operate with HE detergent, so buy the HE version with confidence.

Depending on whether you have hard or soft water, you just need one or two tablespoons of the liquid version.","Use Powder and Pods Differently – The pre-measured pods work just fine in the new high-efficiency machines, but they have to go in before the laundry does to ensure they get fully dissolved by the water. Powder should also go in before the clothing is added, or it can also be added to the dispenser in some cases.

Top-load washers are less expensive than front loaders, making them good for people on a budget. And they don&#39;t require you to bend down as far to reach inside, so they may be better for the elderly or anyone with joint or muscle problems.","A top-load machine will likely be a better choice for a family that is constantly on the go as well, since these appliances typically don’t take as long to clean clothes. Many top-load machines clean using an agitator and keep your clothes immersed in water, whereas <a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\">front-load</a> units, which use an impeller, do not. However, although front-load washers take longer, they are better at cleaning your clothes and are less likely to damage them in the process.","Another upside of top loaders is that, if, shortly after starting your unit, you realize that there are more clothes you want to wash, you can quickly throw them in without a problem. Front loaders, on the other hand, lock and seal to prevent water from leaking out, so you can’t add clothing after it starts.","Front-load washers are more energy efficient than top loaders. Because front loaders do not submerge your laundry, they use less water overall. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/do-front-load-washers-save-money-or-just-water\">Fox News</a> reports that front loaders typically use less water and electricity than top loaders, saving you money on your utility bills.","While front loaders cost less up front, if your unit requires repairs and maintenance, the costs are typically higher for front loaders, according to that article. On the other hand, <a href=\"https://blog.bostonappliance.net/front-load-vs-top-load-washers/\">Boston Appliance</a> says front loaders are more reliable and less likely to need repairs.","Front-load washers are quieter than top-load washers, because they don’t use as much water and tend to be more technologically advanced. Front-load washers also tend to have a variety of settings, features and cycles – like self-cleaning and steam cleaning – whereas low-end top loaders don&#39;t have these bells and whistles.","<strong>Laundry Room Organization</strong>","Having a few bottles of detergent and fabric softener on top of your dryer or occasionally air-drying a shirt on your bed on a towel is not exactly a crisis but if you were hoping to get more organized this year, we have a few ideas that work in even the smallest laundry room:"]},"id":"23ee2711-1fcb-4e58-9d3f-819f9eeb5c3b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Think Thin – Those <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everyday-Home-60-in-x-19-in-x-5-in-6-Tier-Steel-Hanging-Rack-M050018/301034640?cm_mmc=Shopping%7CG%7CBase%7CDD%7C29-29_HOUSEWARES%7CNA%7CNA%7C71700000032305523%7C58700003835510657%7C92700037675004794%7Cpla-544577791412-34721822124&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlqqigvjP3wIVgsBkCh17NgM4EAQYASABEgJLXfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">over-the-door racks</a> might seem like they are too skinny to hold anything significant but they can be remarkably convenient for storing laundry supplies.

Also, even the shortest front-loading machines can’t save as much space as a washer dryer combination unit, which might be the same width but will be more compact in terms of height because it doesn’t need a second unit stacked on it.
