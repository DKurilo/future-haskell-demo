You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Robomow RS630 is <a href=\"/best-robot-lawn-mowers\">automatic lawn mower</a> fit for mowing lawns of up to 0.75 acres. For those with multiple yards or gardens, the multizone feature that comes standard with this mower enables it to mow up to four zones individually. For areas of that are not easily accessible through the robotic function, a remote can be used to better maneuver it into place.","Remote access with this robotic lawn mower is possible in two ways: through a Bluetooth connection using an iOS or Android-based smartphone or tablet or by purchasing the optional remote control. Remote task functions include the ability to set up a schedule for it to follow, to manually navigate it to other zones and to adjust various settings on the mower, such as lawn height.","Cutting height for this robot lawn mower ranges from 0.78 to 3.14 inches. Height is set when programming it, and it then relies on sensors to keep this height throughout the entire lawn area. If the lawn it is to cut has large slopes or hills, this mower may struggle as it can only handle a 20-degree slope.","The Robomow RS630 has a wide cut width of 22 inches. This is wider than most robotic lawn mowers due to its twin blade system. The dual blade system offers a generous cutting width that reduces overall cutting time, helping you save on power costs.","Powered by a rechargeable 26-volt lithium battery, the RS630 takes about 120 minutes to charge. The mower will then operate for approximately 60 to 90 minutes before needing to return to its base to power up again, which it will do automatically. With an included rain sensor, it will also return to its base without any human input when rain or high humidity is detected.","Included in the Robomow RS630 robotic lawn mower price is 1,300 feet of perimeter wire. This is enough to cover the maximum mowing coverage of 0.75 acres, which means that additional wire may be needed. Additional wire is also a necessity for adding multiple zones.","Other Robomow RS630 features, including an edge-cutting mode, an anti-theft alarm, child safety locks and brushless motors, make it stand out among robotic mowers. Brushless motors use less power than conventional motors with brushes, which makes them both quieter and longer lasting than their conventional counterparts. This helps to limit maintenance to this robot mower to yearly blade changes and a lithium battery replacement every four or five years."]},"id":"42120066-6d25-4bb1-a937-9d824d343f10","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63709","url":"/robomow-rs630-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"danny-chadwick","url":"/author/danny-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Danny Chadwick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"DhF8Hg8QQde8MtLyq8X8JN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-25T21:11:14Z","datePublished":"2015-03-25T21:11:14Z","name":"Robomow RS630","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-25T21:11:14Z","id":"yDY6BEWp3ZwrXJTNNS6vYk","meta":{"title":"Robomow RS630 Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Robomow RS630 offers a number of extra features, including an edge-cutting mode, an anti-theft alarm, child safety locks and brushless motors."},"products":[{"slug":"robomow-rs630","url":"/product/robomow-rs630","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:17Z","name":"Robomow RS630","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:17Z","id":"nXNadioR7h3rRPzGcq8RYN","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:16:17Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/EoHvTLWdvpmYzTbqGCTbLS.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:17Z","mimeType":"","name":"63681-robomow-rs630-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63681-robomow-rs630-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:17Z","id":"EoHvTLWdvpmYzTbqGCTbLS","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EoHvTLWdvpmYzTbqGCTbLS.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Robomow RS630 Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Robomow RS630 offers a number of extra features, including an edge-cutting mode, an anti-theft alarm, child safety locks and brushless motors."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/EoHvTLWdvpmYzTbqGCTbLS.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:17Z","mimeType":"","name":"63681-robomow-rs630-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63681-robomow-rs630-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:17Z","id":"EoHvTLWdvpmYzTbqGCTbLS","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EoHvTLWdvpmYzTbqGCTbLS.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Robomow RS630 Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Robomow RS630 offers a number of extra features, including an edge-cutting mode, an anti-theft alarm, child safety locks and brushless motors."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/outdoor/best-robot-lawn-mowers/robomow-rs630-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:17Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:17Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"lawn-mowers","url":"/home-and-garden/lawn-mowers","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:17Z","name":"Lawn Mowers","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:17Z","id":"smr57URmWPEAAvpHn7aR9h","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
