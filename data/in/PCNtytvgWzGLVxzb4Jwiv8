You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Witigo <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-parental-control-software\">cell phone parental control software</a> can help you keep your kids safe as they use their mobile phones. With this program, you can track smartphone activity, set restrictions and view quality reports.","This mobile phone monitoring app tracks most cell phone activity and data. You can see your child’s conversations, browser history, current GPS location, and even photos and videos they take with their smartphone.","You can limit the kinds of apps and online content your child views using the program’s filter. The filter can block questionable content in 27 categories, including violence, gaming and pornography. This feature works on the device’s native browser and third-party browsers such as Google Chrome. You can also blacklist websites by adding their URLs to the blocked website list – your children can’t access these sites, and they don’t show up in search results.","Witigo lets you limit your child’s phone use by blocking hour-long chunks on the parent portal calendar. You can set the calendar to only allow access for a few hours after school or on the weekends. The software can also send you notifications when you child searches for certain keywords.","This cell phone tracker is easy to install, but you have to do most if the setup work on the target device, rather than on the monitoring website as other programs, such as <a href=\"/qustodio-review\">Qustodio</a>, do. You can’t log into the monitoring site from the manufacturer’s website; you receive the login link in an email after you purchase the program. The parent portal itself is simple and well organized, making it easy to navigate and work with.","If you have questions or concerns regarding the product, you can contact Witigo’s customer support team via an online form. The company doesn’t have live chat or phone support, but you can browse a FAQs section on its website.","Witigo tracks a wide variety of activity and provides quick reports. It lets you set up a variety of restrictions through its impressive list of filter categories, and you can create a custom list of safe website. This cell phone monitoring software is backed by good customer service."]},"id":"29115476-bee5-44fb-b61b-689bac4dd9e1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67364","url":"/witigo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-11-02T15:06:08Z","datePublished":"2015-11-02T15:06:08Z","name":"Witigo","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":67,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-11-02T15:06:08Z","id":"PCNtytvgWzGLVxzb4Jwiv8","meta":{"title":"Witigo Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Witigo is cell phone parental control software that lets you customize which sites your child can access.
