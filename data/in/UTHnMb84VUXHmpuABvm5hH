You progress through your genealogy work by building family units and filling in the blanks for essential facts. iFamily focuses more on individuals than the family as a whole, especially when building and viewing your family tree. Media files like audio, video and text documents can link to individuals. And the timeline feature shows how each member&#39;s life overlapped with others through the generations.","The search tool for this software is apt for finding individuals in large databases with only keywords linked to a maiden name or birthplace. iFamily is simple to use for genealogists at all levels. As you build your database, you can add extra information such as sources, media and notes about each person.","iFamily has customizable features, but it lacks the different workspaces other Mac genealogy programs have. Typically, you can find several layouts for entering information and building your tree, such as a pedigree chart or a simple list. In iFamily, the family chart on the main screen is the only type the program offers. However, the data inconsistency report is one of the most useful reports we found. This document points to temporal or data-entry conflicts within your family history database.","This ancestry software is lacking when it comes to overall publishing features. You can create ancestor and descendant reports, but the software exports your data to Microsoft Word. Within the software, you can see fields in a dialogue box to frame your information, but when it&#39;s exported into Word, the information is formatted into paragraphs. It&#39;s inconvenient to export your information to a different program, especially for a task standard in genealogy software.","iFamily for Leopard imports most media files into the database and even exports these files into the text documents in word processing programs. The software works well with other programs and exports GEDCOM files, print copies and Mac applications like iCal and Address Book smoothly. The latter is convenient for remembering living family addresses, birthdays and anniversaries. The dates and contact information can sync with your iOS devices."]},"id":"37a3419b-fe4a-4e8b-a9f3-df509630bf8c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"dfddc28c-eece-4cae-a779-1c444cdc95ff","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["iFamily is straightforward, easy to learn and budget-friendly.
