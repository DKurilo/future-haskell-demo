However, it lacks the critical ability to compress a commercial disc to fit onto smaller blank DVDs, which kept it out of award-winning territory on our side-by-side comparison chart.","The copying tools found in WinX are the boilerplate features we find in almost all of the DVD copy products in our lineup. One of the most important features is the integrated CSS decrypter that allows you to bypass the anti-piracy protections found on commercial discs. This frees you to make personal copies and backups of the movies you’ve legally paid for.","This program is pretty good at making copies of your DVD movies. You can make an exact copy of your DVDs in about 45 minutes. However, it does not have the ability to compress commercial discs (DVD-9s) to the smaller capacity blank DVD (DVD-5s). If you want to make an exact copy of a commercial disc, you must purchase the more expensive dual-layered blank disc (DVD-DLs). The best DVD copying programs  condense the contents of a commercial disc so they fit onto smaller, less-expensive blank DVDs.","This program also enables you to copy a DVD&#39;s ISO file to your hard drive. An ISO file is a disc image that is essentially the blueprint for a DVD. It contains everything from the movie itself to closed captions, audio tracks and bonus material. It also communicates to a DVD player the way the disc is supposed to work. When you save an ISO file to your computer, you essentially have a DVD without the disc. An ISO file will play the same way a disc plays in the software. With WinX, you also have the ability to burn new discs from this file, all you have to do is load it into the interface and copy it the same way you would a physical disc. This is a great way to archive full discs and have them available if your original disc is damaged, lost or stolen."]},"id":"4f257c55-efdd-4179-83b1-1f076c4db3b4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3c4f63f6-76f3-4321-b420-026ef6ebb4d2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["WinX DVD Copy Pro is a fine DVD copier program.
