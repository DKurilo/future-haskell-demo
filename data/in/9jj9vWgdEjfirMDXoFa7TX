The 2x zoom ratio allows for a variety of perspectives, all while keeping the same minimum focus distance.","The <a href=\"http://dslr-camera-lenses-review.toptenreviews.com/\">auto-focus lens</a> was designed to be as light and compact as possible while delivering sharp and vibrant wide-angle shots. Inside the aspherical lens are 12 different glass elements, including High Index/High Dispersion optical glass and Low Dispersion optical glass to keep photos clear and to avoid the fisheye effect. Using the provided lens hood will prevent flares and allow for deeper saturation and vibrant colors.","At the shortest focal length, this lens can display a 109-degree view. When you’re shooting interiors, the wide-angle can capture wide areas of space, ideal for photographing architecture or making real-estate listings.","The lens weighs in at 14.1 oz., making it light enough to add to your camera bag when you’re hiking out to take a landscape shot. The auto-focus is powered by a micro motor for quick and precise focusing, and a switch on the bottom of the lens changes between autofocus and manual.","A broad zoom range of 10-24mm invites a wide array of shooting possibilities, and it is one of the few ultra-wide-angle lenses on the market that offers this range. A manual zoom ring allows for precise positioning. This lens also focuses extremely close at 9.5 inches from the sensor, allowing you to get up close to your subjects.","Tamron is a third-party lens maker, and this ultra-wide-angle lens is significantly less expensive than Nikon and Canon’s 10-24mm offerings. Versions of this DSLR lens are available for Nikon, Canon, Pentax and Sony. It is an APS-C lens and works best with corresponding cameras. However, some full-frame cameras that can scale down to APS-C will work, turning the focal length to 16-37mm.","The Tamron 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5 SP Di II is a cheaper alternative to mainline ultra-wide lenses. For capturing vast landscapes or the interior of buildings, this auto-focus lens offers a large field of vision to get it all in your shot."]},"id":"3542dbe3-6004-448f-ba02-dc539d8eb232","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68111","url":"/tamron-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-07-18T16:47:31Z","datePublished":"2016-07-18T16:47:31Z","name":"Tamron Auto Focus 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5 SP Di II LD Aspherical (IF) Lens","synopsis":"Tamron lauds its Tamron SP 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5 Di II lens for its construction, which is designed to capture high-definition images at an ultra-wide angle without any aberrations or distortion.
