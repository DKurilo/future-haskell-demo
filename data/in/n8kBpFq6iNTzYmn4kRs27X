You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Power Smart DB765124 is a good snow blower for when large snow blowers are too much for your needs but the clearing area is too large for a simple snow shovel. This model is light, weighing only 160 pounds, with small tires measuring 13 inches high. This gas snow blower is best for simple snow-clearing jobs in flat, paved areas such as your driveway, sidewalks or parking lots. The Power Smart clears a path 24 inches wide, while the plow-shaped intake stands 20 inches tall. This makes the Power Smart effective for clearing 6 to 12 inches of snow.","The most important components of a two-stage <a href=\"/best-snow-blowers\">snow blower</a> are the auger and impeller. This snow blower’s auger and impeller measure 12 inches in diameter. The auger shovels snow into the snow blower while the impeller launches snow through the chute. The large diameter of these pieces means you can pick up around a foot of snow on each pass.","The engine in this gas snow blower pumps 208 cubic centimeters of gasoline through the machine to push it forward. This results in almost 10 foot-pounds of torque to push the snow forward. Additionally, the engine uses an electric push start, so you can begin clearing with fewer start attempts and get out of the cold. The Power Smart has a self-propelled drive system that improves steering and pushes through drifts. In case you do have to handle slight inclines or changes in terrain, there are four forward and two reverse speeds.","It&#39;s important to be able to control where the snow you clear lands. Nobody wants to clear a whole driveway, only to have it blocked by the plow pile they created. You can rotate the Power Smart&#39;s polymer chute 180 degrees to keep snow out of your way. This may be a tricky model if you have a curvy driveway to handle, though. The chute uses a hand crank that can be harder to use than single-handed joystick controls.","The Power Smart DB765124 is a sturdy two-stage snow blower fit for light clearing. It weighs only 160 pounds with 13-inch tires. This snow blower can handle up to a foot of snow and clear a path 2 feet wide. However, the controls can be tough to master."]},"id":"5b848aa8-468a-4ddf-9618-db4b289a2e94","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69014","url":"/power-smart-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-01-17T21:36:57Z","datePublished":"2017-01-17T21:36:57Z","name":"Power Smart DB765124","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":20,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-01-17T21:36:57Z","id":"n8kBpFq6iNTzYmn4kRs27X","meta":{"title":"Power Smart Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Power Smart DB765124 is a midsize two-stage snow blower.
