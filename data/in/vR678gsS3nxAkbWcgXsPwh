The jury didn&#39;t hesitate to convict him. He was the only person who knew corporate bank account numbers and passwords.","Even more unsettling, a promising college student has no money to pay his tuition. His personal bank account is suddenly empty. His parents assert that he spent their hard-earned cash on a girlfriend rather than paying for his education.","These types of stories are commonplace. It&#39;s easy to judge and condemn these individuals for bad behavior. Sadly, the true culprit could be a form of malware, instead of unseemly behavior.","Malware is a generic term coined by computer professionals to describe software engineered with a malicious intent. Malware infiltrates a computer without the owner&#39;s consent. The perceived ill will of the code&#39;s creator is the reason it receives the designation of malware.","All malware invades, disrupts and causes harm to the affected computer. Classic symptoms of contamination include poor computer performance and sudden computer rebooting. Examples of malware include computer viruses, spyware, worms, Trojan horses, dishonest adware, crimeware, keyloggers and more.","Spyware, also a generic term used by computer professionals, describes software engineered to perform surveillance. Not all spyware is ill-intended. Most spyware exists to monitor web-browsing habits. When visiting compromised websites, users unwittingly download the spyware. A surprising number of websites, even well respected ones, embed a form of spyware into their code. The software&#39;s purpose is to monitor and report marketing information back to advertisers and companies. This is how the term adware arose. Commonly referred to as a data-mining program, this type of spyware is relatively harmless. Its biggest potential effect is slowing the performance of a contaminated computer.   <br/><br/>"]},"id":"e9ecdd91-5dc9-44f9-865c-19d76d1b9f7d","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Once recorded, a cyber-crook receives the ill-gotten data. The vehicle of transmission is the unsuspecting user&#39;s own internet connection. Once received, the thief sifts through the data and uses the information to drain the victim&#39;s bank accounts, access email accounts and more.","Users can contract a keylogger through several methods. Some viruses carry this form of spyware within their code. However, the most common form of contamination comes from clicking on email attachments or email-embedded links. Once clicked, the keylogger is loaded onto the computer. A new innovative hacker technique hides the keylogger in an mp3 file or delivers it through a XSS (Cross Site Scripting) attack.","XSS attacks are the injection of malicious scripts into web pages. Clickjacking and Code Injection are common forms and names of an XSS attack. When this type of onslaught happens, access to sensitive page content, session cookies and personal information occurs by circumventing the normal browser client-side security. In simple terms, the malicious code masquerades as a website and tricks the browser into allowing access.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"53467564-a552-4506-bdb0-f520cee29862","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Firewalls are the user&#39;s first line of defense.
