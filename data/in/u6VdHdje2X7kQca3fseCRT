If you prefer a dial display, consider the <a href=\"/best-candy-thermometers\">Polder Candy/Deep Fry Thermometer</a>.","This <a href=\"/best-candy-thermometers\">candy thermometer</a> is 12 inches long, so it can sink deep enough into a pot for an accurate reading. The thermometer’s length also leaves plenty of room for large numbers, that are easy to read while you are cooking over a hot stove. The large, visible temperature zones are marked plainly beginning at 100 degrees Fahrenheit and going as high as 400 degrees. On the right you will find Celsius temperature markings as well as critical stages for candy making including indicators for soft ball, hard ball, soft crack and hard crack stages.","The glass thermometer tube operates with alcohol instead of mercury, making this a good choice for cooks who are concerned about using the toxic substance around food.","With common candy temperatures etched into the thermometer’s metal casing, it is easy to tell when your concoction has reached the appropriate heat stage, and you won’t have to remove or jostle the thermometer to get your reading.","This thermometer also boasts an oversized, insulated handle. Its size and shape make the handle easy to grab and hold even when you are wearing a heat glove. At the back of the handle, you will find a built-in pan clip to help keep the thermometer safe and steady while you are cooking.","The stainless steel construction of the 5983N Taylor Candy/Deep Fry Thermometer makes it a durable kitchen instrument and easy to clean. The shape of the thermometer precludes using it as a probe, however; so you won’t be able to insert the tip into anything but liquid.","Overall, this thermometer is a handy and easy-to-use kitchen device that candy makers will appreciate for its clear, large temperature gauge and clearly marked candy making temperature ranges. The overall length makes the 5983N Taylor Candy/Deep Fry Thermometer a smart choice for people who make large batches of candy in deep pots."]},"id":"e91aa486-2c3d-4cab-8cb8-4c9c54599022","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63289","url":"/taylor-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-06T23:09:09Z","datePublished":"2015-03-06T23:09:09Z","name":"Taylor 5983N","synopsis":"The 5983N Taylor Candy/Deep Fry Thermometer is designed to be easy to hold and easy to read, and it can easily rest in a pot nicely to give an accurate temperature reading when you need it.
