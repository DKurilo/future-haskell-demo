They have one simple job to do. Generally, they range anywhere from $40 to $100, and we found some great performers around the $40 range.","Accuracy &amp; Projection<br/> The first and most important element to consider with these tools is accuracy. Whether you are drawing a paint line or completely renovating a room, accuracy is vital to your project. We tested each laser level to make sure it was capable of finding the true level, by manual positioning or self-leveling. We gave special attention to self-leveling models that use an internal pendulum to find true level – these levels were incredibly accurate. ","Something worth checking with self-leveling laser lines is their ability to find true level even while being somewhat out of level themselves. Each self-leveling model uses an internal pendulum to find true level, but they all must be situated within a certain degree range to be accurate. Look for units that can accommodate at least four degrees out of level.","Projection<br/> When looking for the best laser level, you&#39;ll want to consider each tool&#39;s ability to cast a line effectively against your surface. Many of the levels we considered can project a clear, visible line up to 30 feet away, which gives you plenty of room to work with. Another element to consider is the laser&#39;s fan angle, which is how wide the level can cast a line against a surface. The wider the angle, the longer the line appears on your wall or surface, meaning you only need to set the line level once to get a consistent, level line across an entire wall or multiple walls.","Another important feature to consider is the number of beams the levels can produce simultaneously. Some levels only project one horizontal beam, but more advanced laser levels can produce crossbeams with two lasers. This cross-line feature is useful in a number of situations, such as when you need to tile a bathroom or hang a picture frame with furniture below it.","Design, Durability &amp; Support Options<br/> Make sure the laser level you buy has a durable design that can withstand rough conditions. In case the level is bumped off its tripod or wall-mounting bracket, you want to know that it will survive a little tumble. This consideration is particularly important for self-leveling laser lines, as the internal pendulum is a sensitive component. Tools that allow you to lock the pendulum in place minimize this risk.","Additionally, make sure you understand how long the batteries last, as you don&#39;t want to be in the middle of a project when the batteries die, leaving you at square one. Look for laser line levels that will operate for hours with continuous use, as this ensures a long battery life between replacements.","Warranty<br/> Whenever you buy a tool, it&#39;s a good idea to know what the warranty is so you can return it if needed. Look for a company that offers a warranty of at least a year so you don&#39;t have to worry about running into a defect days after the warranty expires. "]},"id":"16ccce39-3d07-45e8-8afb-aac6f39c8538","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/jrnYuPaG8hWFNnMHpDi4Qd.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/home-laser-line-levels/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9IL0MvODE5Njk2L29yaWdpbmFsL0xhc2VyLUxpbmUtTGV2ZWxzLVRlc3RpbmctMDA1LmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrnYuPaG8hWFNnMHpDi4Qd.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"jrnYuPaG8hWFNnMHpDi4Qd","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrnYuPaG8hWFNnMHpDi4Qd.jpg","alt":""},"id":"70334c83-304a-4eaf-ad88-ca723d2d4d4d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>How Do You Use a Laser Level Outdoors?</strong>","It can be a bit difficult to use your laser line level outdoors since it may be hard to see.
