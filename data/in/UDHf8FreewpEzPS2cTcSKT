With an MSRP of $24.99, it has more attachments and features than many pricier <a href=\"/best-facial-cleansing-brushes\">facial cleansing brushes</a>, and replacement brush heads are available for less than $10 each. Although the <a href=\"/neutrogena-review\">Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System</a> is priced slightly lower than the Etereauty device, the Etereauty has much more functionality. The Neutrogena system is designed exclusively for microdermabrasion, while this device provides full-body skin care.","The Etereauty 5 in 1 performs cleansing, exfoliation and microdermabrasion functions and comes with five attachments: two facial cleansing brushes, a larger body brush, a crude polish accessory and a pumice applicator. It has a convenient upright stand for storing its handle, but it lacks a storage container for the attachments.","Unlike the <a href=\"/clarisonic-review\">Clarisonic Mia 2</a> and the <a href=\"/clinique-review\">Clinique Sonic System</a>, which use sonic oscillation technology to cleanse your skin, the Etereauty 5 in 1 uses rotating technology. <br/>“It’s comfortable to hold, and it works like the other rotating brushes,” said one of our testers. “You can tell a real difference between the firm and softer brush heads, which is nice, but if you don’t pull all your hair back, it will catch and pull.”","Our testers also mentioned that the crude polish accessory, which is used for microdermabrasion, made their skin burn and could irritate sensitive skin. In line with this concern, Etereauty recommends consulting your physician before using this product if you are undergoing skin treatment of any kind, including chemical peels, professional microdermabrasion or plastic surgery. Also, this brush isn’t recommended for skin that is especially dry, rough, reddened or sensitive. You should also avoid using it if you have highly allergic skin, severe acne, an infection, an open wound or a sunburn.","Whatever facial cleansing brush you choose, <a href=\"https://www.kachiuleemd.com/\">Dr. Kachiu C. Lee</a>, Assistant Professor of Dermatology at Brown University and the Director of the Laser and Aesthetics Center in Providence, Rhode Island, advises that you take care not to apply too much pressure to your skin or use your brush too often.<br/>“Many people misuse brushes by thinking that ‘more is better,’” she told us, “and they push too hard on the brush, which actually irritates the skin.  Others use their brush too frequently – multiple times a day – which can also irritate the skin due to the trauma of overusing the brush.”","When used as recommended, the Etereauty 5 in 1 is meant to minimize pores, remove blackheads and remove dead skin cells, as well as improve blood circulation and firm and tighten skin. The device is waterproof and can be used in the shower and rinsed under warm running water. Dirty brush bristles can be cleaned with warm and air dried. You should plan to replace the brush heads every three months with normal use.","This facial cleansing brush has two speeds. Along with its attachments, its accessories include an upright storage stand to protect the device when it’s not in use. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with a storage or travel case for its brush heads. If you travel often, you may want to consider the <a href=\"/vanity-planet-review\">Vanity Planet Ultimate Skin Spa</a>. Take note that both brushes require AAs, which are not included with your purchase. The Etereauty brush operates on four batteries, while the Vanity Planet requires two.","The Etereauty 5 in 1 Beauty Care Massager is covered by a one-year warranty, which is a common level of consumer protection for this product type. The only option we were able to find for customer service is an online contact form. Most other companies provide service by both phone and email."]},"id":"c8cb67ac-b53d-4097-8a7d-d223ef51a248","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70242","url":"/etereauty-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-20T15:15:38Z","datePublished":"2018-09-20T15:15:38Z","name":"Etereauty 5-in-1 Beauty Care Massager","synopsis":"The Etereauty 5 in 1 Beauty Care Massager isn’t the least expensive of the facial cleansing brushes we tested, but it provides the best value.","review":{"rating":83,"verdict":"The Etereauty 5 in 1 Beauty Care Massager has five interchangeable brush heads and two speed settings.
