This is twice as long as some other <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-drones,review-2412.html\">drones</a> on the market. More time means more opportunities for beautiful aerial footage or still photographs. Longer flight times also mean more fun for you.","With a long battery life, you are going to want a long range too and this drone doesn’t disappoint. It has a range of 3,280 feet. The drone measures 13.19 x 13.19 x 6.89 inches. It weighs 3.9 pounds, which is the heaviest of the drones we reviewed. It comes in three different colors: pearl white, grey and carbon fiber.","This drone doesn’t include a stabilization gimbal or a camera. It does have the ability to hold a payload of 14.11 ounces, though. If you want to use the drone to shoot some stills or videos from the skies, you’ll have to purchase a camera separately. The drone does include retractable landing gear, which some other manufacturers sell separately.","Fortunately, this UAV does have a built-in GPS, so it has flight-planning, a return-to-home feature and automatic landing. It even has a Follow Me mode, where the drone uses the onboard GPS to hover near you. Also, if you experience a loss of signal, the drone will return to its starting position to land.","The drone is ready to fly and comes with a 22.2V 5400mAh LiPo battery, to which you can attribute to its long flight times. The base model of this personal drone does not include a transmitter or transmitter battery, which is a bit of a disappointment, especially since this drone is already more expensive than other models.","This RC drone does have a warranty, albeit a short one. You are covered for just one week after purchasing the drone. Some manufacturers offer a warranty for a month, others for just a week or even not at all. With a drone, you have a high risk of crashing or breaking a part, but accidental damage isn’t covered under Walkera&#39;s warranty. However, if a part malfunctions or you need support, you can reach Walkera by phone or email. You also can download the instruction manual for this drone online."]},"id":"537f6a15-081f-4eb7-9119-fb83b6e9662b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c6d728e4-5071-4121-9d58-8f751fc77921","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Walkera Scout X4 drone’s battery is its main selling point.
