With the Sony HDR-CX760V<strong> </strong>you can make your own HD home movies. This <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">HDV camcorder</a> has high-resolution still pictures and a impressive zoom to capture all of the action. And since quality and zoom aren&#39;t the only things to consider when looking into any camcorder, HD or not, there are plenty of other features on this high-definition video camera including touchscreen capability, GPS and built-in flash. This product earns our respect<strong> </strong>because it has the best variety of features and the most complete functionality.","The name Sony is widely recognized as one of the big competitors in audio and video equipment, and this HDV camcorder doesn&#39;t disappoint. Sony combines the best of the video and audio recording equipment in a consumer product. But having all these premium tools in one machine does not mean it&#39;s difficult to use. Quite to the contrary, this high-definition camcorder is so easy to use that no one should feel under qualified  using it. It is designed for anyone to use, whether you are a professional cameraman or a novice looking to preserve your child&#39;s first steps."]},"id":"d656c305-5ae6-4d12-ae6f-ca3013b19bce","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Image Quality"},"id":"8019d17e-432a-41ac-9e6b-1e40228bc0f4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/yBukST7R6sBPHyXtM8rin4.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"While all of the products we reviewed are categorized as HD video camcorders, they all have different specifications.

Whether you are standing across the table from the birthday cake or at the other end of the soccer field, you will capture every moment in high quality.","The Sony HDR-CX760V has full 60p/24p recording capability. We were also impressed with the 28 Mbps on the HD PS recording video mode. The higher the bit rate, the higher the overall quality of the video. This HDV camcorder has variable video recording modes that give you a variety of quality options, which affects how long you can record. Just make sure to match the memory card you are using to the speed. If you don&#39;t match the speed the card will be too slow for the high bit rate of the camcorder or you&#39;ll pay for speed you can&#39;t use.","Lighting is one of the biggest variables when working with pictures and videos. Too much light or too little, the results are the same – poor images. We looked at the LUX rating to see how well the product does in low lighting. One candle in a meter space produces one LUX.
