While this card will not bowl you over with astounding features, it does include low fees and charges. It also gives you the ability to transfer money to your card directly from your bank account. Walmart states in the cardholder agreement that it can change its fees at any time, but the following fees are disclosed on the company&#39;s MoneyCard website:"]},"id":"b9d53c2c-8bbd-41ad-a3eb-3a9c0c74e930","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["One-time Walmart fee: $3","ATM withdrawal: $2 plus ATM fees","International ATM withdrawal: $2 plus ATM fees","ATM balance inquiry: $1","Replacement card: $3","Second card: $3","Foreign purchases: Two percent of total purchase amount in U.S. dollars"],"type":"ul"},"id":"09aba9ea-efb8-47b4-87d1-7789c198f2c0","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Loading a minimum of $1,000 per month will negate the $3 monthly maintenance fee.","Several other prepaid credit card companies will administer a fee to check your balance through customer service; the Walmart MoneyCard does not. Conveniently, you can check your balance and transaction history online or call customer service without charge. As with many other prepaid cards, there is an age requirement. All cardholders for this Walmart MoneyCard Family card must be at least 16 years of age. According to the cardholder agreement, all minors ages 16 or 17 must have a parent on the phone with them during the card- and account-activation process.","Every prepaid credit card comes with a privacy agreement and a cardholder agreement. They each contain language that is often confusing and technical garble known as fine print. The agreement for the Walmart prepaid credit card, however, definitely takes the cake. There is so much fine print associated with this card. Of course, we do understand why Walmart must hash out every little detail, but the language it uses is difficult to understand, which makes reading the cardholder agreement more than a little frustrating.","While you do retain the option to use your prepaid credit card for car rentals, the rental agency will authorize a hold for these funds on your card until you return the car and even for several weeks afterword. This kind of hold is commonplace and will transpire with gas stations, restaurants and hotels. This hold means that, if you rented a car for $400 total, that money would not available for you to spend. Walmart MoneyCard suggests that &#34;you use your credit card for the initial authorization [of the car] and pay with your credit card.&#34; We have issue with this statement because many people who pursue and use prepaid credit cards cannot qualify for an actual credit card.","We also take issue with Walmart&#39;s policy on removing a second cardholder from your account. You are able to order a second card (for $3) and give it to a family member or friend. This card is linked to your account. According to the FAQs section, the only way to remove it is to &#34;cut up the second card and return it, along with the cardholder&#39;s name to the Walmart MoneyCard Customer Service.&#34; You would assume Walmart would offer more options. One of the main features of this prepaid credit card is the absence of a credit check. To obtain a card, however, you will need to submit your name, address, date of birth and social security number to Walmart.","The cardholder agreement tells you in no uncertain terms what you can and cannot use the card for. According to the agreement, &#34;The Walmart MoneyCard may only be used for personal, family or household purposes.&#34; You can use your prepaid credit card for the following transactions:"]},"id":"7de963a9-4bc0-4bb1-9d32-2695204f499e","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Make purchases everywhere Visa or MasterCard credit cards are accepted","Receive cash back from merchants","Withdraw cash from an ATM"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3ce3d17b-526a-4cc0-8695-c688a42d8906","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Naturally, you cannot use this card for illegal purchases or internet gambling.","Walmart isn&#39;t a billion-dollar corporation for nothing. It definitely knows how to keep you close and your money even closer. At first glance, there seems to be numerous ways for you to load your prepaid credit card with money. Upon closer inspection, we see that three of the six loading options must be done at Walmart, including:","<strong>Check </strong>– You can cash your payroll or government check at Walmart and then load your prepaid card with the money. Again, you must load a minimum of $20 each time. If you load money from your check that you cashed at Wal-Mart onto your card, you can load up to $2,999 because the maximum that you can have on the card at any time is $3,000.","<strong>Cash </strong>–You can swipe your prepaid card at thousands of participating locations across the U.S. to load money. You are required to load a minimum of $20 each time and are limited to loading a maximum of $1,100. You will also pay a $3 fee each time you load the credit card.","<strong>MoneyCenter</strong> – Participating Walmart stores will have a MoneyCenter Express at the front of the store. This express station looks like an ATM, but you can do so much more. Not only can you withdrawal money, but you can also add money to your prepaid credit card, purchase money orders and more. Keep in mind that you will be charged a compulsory $3 fee to load money onto your card using this option.","In addition to the options Walmart affords you, you can also have your employer deposit your money directly into your MoneyCard prepaid card account or transfer money from your bank or credit union. There are no reload fees for these options. If neither option is available to you, you can purchase a Green Dot MoneyPak cash reload card. Many retailers will charge you up to $4.95 for one of these cards.","Note: You cannot withdrawal more than $400 in cash from an ATM each day, and you cannot spend more than $3,000 in a 24-hour period. This $3,000 limit includes cash back.","Customer support is happy to help should you have questions, concerns, technical questions or if you need to report a lost or stolen card. The customer service phone number is available on the Walmart website. For email support, you are provided a link on the Contact Us page that will take you to a form that you can fill out.","A FAQs page on the company&#39;s website is available to answer general questions. Unfortunately, there is no semblance of consistency because the answers vary between detailed and vague."]},"id":"deb466af-83b1-4a53-ae0b-be8532174a7b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"827aecb9-9b65-4872-a849-6ecde6313d44","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Walmart prepaid credit card is surprising.
