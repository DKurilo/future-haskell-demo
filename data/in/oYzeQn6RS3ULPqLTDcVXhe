First, you upload a photo and define four basic facial points. Then you tell the software where the main facial points are – about 40 – and Pink Mirror does the rest. It can auto-detect faces, but only one per image. If you need to edit a picture with more than one subject, you must use different software. Once Pink Mirror has touched up your photo, it has a handy slide bar that compares the &#34;before and after&#34; images.","Because Pink Mirror does all of the enhancing for you, you have very little control over the final product. We are impressed with how well the photo retouching software does automatically, but we would have liked to see it give users a little more control. Pink Mirror will automatically whiten teeth, lift cheeks, reshape noses, smooth skin and brighten the image. To download your retouched photo without a watermark, you have to purchase the premium membership.","You can contact Pink Mirror via email if you have specific questions about the software. The company doesn&#39;t have a phone number or any other contact information. Before you get frustrated though, check the FAQs for a solution to your problem."]},"id":"4e4be59c-32ed-4a4c-8406-7304ddf9efee","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6e711eba-6862-4bf8-a1f1-497d53d5a7a5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Pink Mirror is photo retouching software that enhances your portraits in four simple steps.
