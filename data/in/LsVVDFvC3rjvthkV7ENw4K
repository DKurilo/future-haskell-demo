The company recently expanded into hair clippers with the Volare X1, a set of trimmers inspired by Ferrari in performance and appearance.

The easy-grip rubberized back and one-hour charge time play to the device’s advantage when you also factor in the three speed settings for different hair types. The power of the motor is quickly apparent as it shears effortlessly through wet and dry hair alike without jamming.","The cutting mechanism of the hair trimmer consist of a fixed-steel blade coated in titanium and a moving-steel blade coated in a diamond-like carbon. The combination of blades creates a prolific cutting machine that can go for up to 70 minutes on a full charge. The unit’s longevity is ensured with an assortment of high-grade accessories, such as a charging stand, oil to minimize friction on the blades, a cleaning brush to remove hair from the blades and a number of comb attachments for varying lengths.","The Volare X1 comes with warranties to protect specific parts of the device. The blades come with a one-year warranty and protect against any damage or dulling. The motor and electric elements in the body of the hair shears are protected for a total of two years. Whether you need weekly or monthly trims, this device should withstand long-term use. But if there is a defect, it&#39;s nice to know you&#39;re protected by multiple warranties.","When it comes to chic aesthetics, the BaByliss Pro Volare X1 doesn’t hold back. The design of the clipper’s body does seem somewhat reflective of the showiness of Ferrari, though you have to open the hood and view the components to see anything with a Ferrari insignia on it. However, since the Italian carmakers designed the X1&#39;s motor, you can bet these are among the best and most powerful clippers you can buy."]},"id":"9c40cb72-85f7-4ca4-a461-0840e68eff9b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58161","url":"/babyliss-clippers-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-14T20:27:54Z","datePublished":"2013-11-14T20:27:54Z","name":"BaByliss Pro Volare X1","synopsis":"Editor's note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-11-14T20:27:54Z","id":"LsVVDFvC3rjvthkV7ENw4K","meta":{"title":"BaByliss Pro Volare X1 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The BaByliss Pro Volare X1 is among the more expensive hair trimmers, but the motor is effortlessly shears through wet and dry hair alike without jamming."},"products":[{"slug":"babyliss-pro-volare-x1","url":"/product/babyliss-pro-volare-x1","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:48Z","name":"BaByliss Pro Volare X1","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:48Z","id":"QUetXNpQQDjetBupCkFFNG","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T23:44:48Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/cFKeWmRXRiufzXs5jpGQcN.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:48Z","mimeType":"","name":"58133-babyliss-pro-volare-x1-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/58133-babyliss-pro-volare-x1-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:48Z","id":"cFKeWmRXRiufzXs5jpGQcN","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cFKeWmRXRiufzXs5jpGQcN.jpg","alt":""},"title":"BaByliss Pro Volare X1 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The BaByliss Pro Volare X1 is among the more expensive hair trimmers, but the motor is effortlessly shears through wet and dry hair alike without jamming."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/cFKeWmRXRiufzXs5jpGQcN.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:48Z","mimeType":"","name":"58133-babyliss-pro-volare-x1-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/58133-babyliss-pro-volare-x1-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:48Z","id":"cFKeWmRXRiufzXs5jpGQcN","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cFKeWmRXRiufzXs5jpGQcN.jpg","alt":""},"title":"BaByliss Pro Volare X1 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The BaByliss Pro Volare X1 is among the more expensive hair trimmers, but the motor is effortlessly shears through wet and dry hair alike without jamming."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/beauty/best-electric-hair-clippers/babyliss-clippers-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"health-and-beauty","url":"/health-and-beauty","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:48Z","name":"Health & Beauty","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:48Z","id":"5johNE4w3ctxAug7oACGPh","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"hair-care","url":"/health-and-beauty/hair-care","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:44:48Z","name":"Hair Care","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:44:48Z","id":"iPK3oHStMacB6mfFYRm8gn","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
