You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","JVC Everio GZ-MG630 with 60 GB of storage is an awesome, compact alternative to the end camcorder.  The model comes in Blue, silver, and red and weighs in at a mere 11 ounces.  The camera also has very convenient 2.7 inch LCD viewfinder.","Standout Features","•\tVideo Upscaling<br/>•\tLarge CCD Sensor<br/>•\tBuilt-in 60GB HDD","The camera is equipped with an HDMI input which gives the camera upscaling capabilities. Where the port is on the camera and your television set is not the component that is attempting to upscale, instead it’s coming straight from the source itself.  The camera’s video output quality ends up being top notch.","The larger than normal CCD Sensor is an 800,000 megapixel sensor, up from 680,000 in previous models.  It makes for a higher quality video.","The built- in 60 GB HDD stores up to 14 hours of the highest quality of video, ample space for a whole vacation.  Problem is finding a hard drive for your computer that’s large enough to hold all this video for when you need to unload and go on another vacation.","Summary of Reviews","Consumers appreciated the sensor upgrade as well as the large capacity of the HDD.  They also commented on how compact the camera was and the ability to take it anywhere.","Summary","I definitely was surprised by this camcorder.  Between the large capacity and the great ability to upscale the video quality when playing on your TV I was very impressed.  The price is not bad at  around $380, it would be difficult to find a better camera for the same or lower price than the JVC Everio GZ-MG630.<br/> "]},"id":"d05d8a84-e6a1-45e0-a456-692714cb9c77","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_38167","url":"/jvc-cnetgzmg630blu-39913-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-07-20T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-07-20T06:00:00Z","name":"Jvc Everio Gz-mg630 (blue) cnetgzmg630blu","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":27,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-07-20T22:02:22Z","id":"WXdhMYWMRkQHhiL9zsVgVg","meta":{"title":"Jvc Everio Gz-mg630 (blue) Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
