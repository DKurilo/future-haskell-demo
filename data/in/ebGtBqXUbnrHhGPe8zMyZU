This diversity of storage sizes is one of the Turbo&#39;s few advantages. The Turbo&#39;s performance in transferring data is a bit above average, which helps this drive earn its place in our top 10 flash drives. The Turbo lacks many of the useful features we see in the best USB flash drives. Still, for casual use, the PNY Turbo works well â€“ just don&#39;t expect anything special.","During our testing, the PNY Turbo averaged a sequential read speed of 196MBps and a sequential write speed of 79MBps. These are respectable numbers compared to many USB 3.0 drives on the market. Keep in mind that transferring files off of the drive is much quicker than transferring them to the drive. This is essentially the difference between read and write speeds.","Even though the PNY Turbo does well with sequential read and write speeds, it still earns a lower overall score for performance. This is because its 4K random read and write speeds are terrible. Well, the 4K read speed is decent, coming in at 6.5MBps, but the 4K write speed is slow enough that it&#39;s almost not worth thinking about: 0.03MBps. You don&#39;t want to run any applications or an operating system off of this USB flash drive.","The Turbo has a unique design that does away with any sort of cap. Instead, a plastic sheath slides over the USB port when the drive is not in use. This is an elegant solution and doesn&#39;t require moving the actual flash memory. This means greater durability in the long run, as none of the moving parts are integral to the flash drive&#39;s functionality.","You won&#39;t find any password protection or encryption software here, which is unfortunate. It&#39;s more important than ever to keep your data secure, and most USB flash drive manufacturers take some steps to address security.","We were quite disappointed to learn that PNY only offers a one-year warranty on the Turbo. Most USB flash drives have warranties that last for at least five years. Many have lifetime warranties. If you need help with your drive, you can contact PNY through email or by phone."]},"id":"e2c5bd52-61a3-4f51-8936-5bd4bbe6c151","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2d693f09-8b55-4294-9f96-b1167105b9a5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The PNY Turbo is not the best flash drive you can get, but it performs well enough to appeal to casual users.
