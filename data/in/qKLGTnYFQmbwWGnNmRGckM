The original review is below, but check out our current</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/mobile/accessories/best-bluetooth-car-kits/\">Bluetooth Car Kit Reviews</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Plantronics K100 is a Bluetooth car kit designed to be simple and intuitive. With three large buttons and a volume wheel, you don&#39;t have look at it to know which button to push. The button on the left is for an FM transmitter. The button on the right mutes the call. And the button in the middle of the volume wheel is for answering calls and activating voice commands. It won&#39;t take you long to master the controls without taking your eyes off the road. Unfortunately, the call quality doesn&#39;t match the intuitive design, and it lacks many of the features you&#39;d find with the best Bluetooth car kits.","The best feature of the Plantronics K100 Bluetooth car kit is the FM transmitter. The advantage is the ability to transmit your calls, GPS directions and other audio through your car&#39;s speaker – a great improvement over the small speaker it uses if you don&#39;t use the FM transmitter. However, the FM transmission isn&#39;t consistent. It&#39;s often difficult to find a clear FM station that doesn&#39;t have static interfering with the audio signal. The FM feature also drains the battery much faster.","The biggest flaw of the Plantronics K100 is the call quality. It uses the standard narrowband frequency range of 150Hz to 3.4kHz. This leaves your callers sounding stereotypically like they&#39;re on a phone – tinny, hollow and lacking the natural definition. There&#39;s a lot more &#34;Could you repeat that?&#34; and &#34;What&#39;d you just say?&#34; with standard narrowband. The best Bluetooth car kits use a wideband HD voice frequency response of 50Hz to over 7kHz, which encompasses most of the frequency range the human voice comprises.","Since the Plantronics K100 has the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) for Bluetooth, you can stream any audio from your mobile device through the monaural speaker. This is useful for receiving instructions from a GPS app. It&#39;s also useful if you have a text-to-speech feature or app on your phone, allowing you to hear your incoming texts instead of reading them, which is one of the most dangerous distractions while driving. However, Plantronics doesn&#39;t include an app for this purpose.","The Plantronics K100 also includes the Hands-Free Bluetooth Profile (HFP). This allows you to use voice commands for various functions, such as answering or ending a call. This profile also allows you to voice dial. However, since it lacks the Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP), voice dialing your contacts doesn&#39;t work unless your phone has a voice-dialing feature.","The battery life is 17 hours, which is above average. The standby time, which is how long it can go without being used before it needs to be recharged, is only two weeks. This is the shortest lifespan among all the Bluetooth hands-free car kits we reviewed. However, since it uses your car&#39;s charger port to recharge, the short standby time is only a small issue."]},"id":"f60f71c6-76d5-4e10-8af0-d4f38368ff07","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"316726de-4172-4d09-acba-4d178363d6fd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Plantronics K100 is an affordable Bluetooth car kit with an FM transmitter that allows you to boost the output by using your car speakers.
