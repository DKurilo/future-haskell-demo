Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","EasyCare is an <a href=\"/best-extended-car-warranty-services\">extended car warranty company</a> that offers multiple levels of coverage to customers nationwide. You can get coverage for up to five years and 120,000 miles on top of your vehicle’s manufacturer warranty, and the service offers all the standard features we expect to see in an extended warranty. However, the vehicle requirements are the most restrictive out of all the car warranty companies we reviewed.","We were unable to obtain a quote from EasyCare due to its strict vehicle restrictions. Unlike <a href=\"/carchex-review\">Carchex</a> and <a href=\"/autopom-review\">Autopom</a>, EasyCare only covers cars that are under two years old and under 24,000 miles. Because we used a 4-year-old car with 39,000 miles to get quotes from each company, we were unable to get one from EasyCare. However, if your vehicle falls within these narrow restrictions, this is a good company to consider as it offers nationwide coverage and four different types of plans – Total Care, Stated Care, Primary Care and Power Care.","The Total Care package is the most comprehensive plan while the Stated Care package offers slightly less. The Primary Care and Power Care packages are the more standard plans that cover major parts of the vehicle such as the engine and transmission.","Some of the features include roadside assistance and rental car reimbursement, which are standard features with all the companies we reviewed. In the event your car needs to be in the repair shop, EasyCare will reimburse you for six days, at $30 per day, for a rental vehicle.","We were happy to see that this service lets you choose the repair location and will handle the payment directly in the event your car needs repairs. And when it does, you only have to pay a $100 deductible, which is the industry standard.","You don’t have to worry about forking out thousands of dollars upfront to purchase an extended car warranty from EasyCare as it offers flexible monthly payment plans that can stretch to 18 months. You can also take advantage of a 30-day money-back guarantee if you aren’t happy with the coverage.","Although we couldn&#39;t get a quote from EasyCare due to its restrictions on car age and mileage, we didn’t have any issues with the company&#39;s customer service. However, we were disappointed there wasn&#39;t 24/7 support or a live chat support option. Additionally, the website doesn&#39;t list frequently asked questions, which often answer many common questions so you don&#39;t have to contact customer service."]},"id":"07cc3745-ba35-4446-b014-147d9edf4483","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8758f018-98a7-4f53-b6f2-a7ce8b774efe","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["EasyCare is an extended car warranty service only worth considering if you have a newer vehicle with fewer than 24,000 miles.
