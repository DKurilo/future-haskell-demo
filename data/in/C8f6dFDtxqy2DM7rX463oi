Credit Counseling Solutions is an Atlanta, Georgia-based consumer <a href=\"/best-debt-consolidation-companies\">credit counseling</a> agency.

ClearPoint has lower fees than other services, makes its services available to a broader audience than most, and has useful education resources and financial tools. For these reasons and more, ClearPoint receives our Top Ten Reviews Gold Award.","One of the main services a credit counseling agency provides is a debt management plan. These plans are a good option if you&#39;re struggling with a heavy debt load. Under a debt management plan, the credit counseling agency negotiates with your creditors for a reduction in interest rates or a lower monthly payment.","When you enroll in a debt management plan, you close your existing accounts and make a single monthly payment to the credit counseling agency, in this case ClearPoint. ClearPoint then distributes the appropriate amount to each of your creditors. A debt management plan usually lasts from between three to five years. Initially there is a small impact to your credit score since you close accounts, but in the long term, a debt management plan carries lower risk than <a href=\"/best-debt-consolidation-companies\">debt consolidation</a>."]},"id":"2887deb3-8d19-412f-9ca2-717f311d14fb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Advisory &amp; Education"},"id":"ab043e78-9e77-4777-9571-a1eb04876f16","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/2Wzr5drpnVdzBmVCbr9z4H.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The first counseling session is one of the most important aspects of any credit counseling service.

ClearPoint was not as thorough as other counseling agencies were when breaking down income and spending and helping to create a budget, nor did it send follow up material to our reviewer. For these reasons, ClearPoint scored slightly lower for its initial advisory period, but your experience may vary depending on the counselor you speak to.","The best counseling services serve as more than just a place to call for advice and to sign up for debt management plans. Their websites should be repositories of financial information and advice. ClearPoint offers educational resources that are frequently updated, cover a broad range of topics and come in a variety of styles.","In addition to blogs and FAQs, which are fairly standard in the industry, ClearPoint also has downloadable eBooks and podcasts. Topics covered include basic financial areas, like saving and budgeting, but also how to make a five-year plan and what to do if your lose your job. This combination of thoroughness and variety was nearly unmatched in our review.","ClearPoint&#39;s website also features a variety of calculators and financial tools to help you learn about your financial situation and put it into a larger context. The three most important tools are a debt-to-income ratio calculator, a debt payoff calculator and a financial health quiz. These tools are simple to use and provide clear recommendations on next steps to take if your financial situation needs them. Other tools ClearPoint offers include budget planners, a net-worth calculator and a tool to help you find affordable cars in your price range.","ClearPoint also offers online courses through its ClearPoint University, including a personalized learning program that allows you to customize it for your needs.
