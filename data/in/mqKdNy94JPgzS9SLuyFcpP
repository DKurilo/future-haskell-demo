It is available in three colors and carries a one-year warranty. Doheny&#39;s Water Warehouse manufactures the BlueBlue Solar Cover blankets under its Clear-Tek brand.","Like most solar pool covers, the solar cover is made of a polyethylene polymer and uses air bubbles to trap heat. This solar cover is quite lightweight and a single person can easily deploy and roll it up. However, at 5 mils, it is one of thinnest pool covers available. <a href=\"/best-solar-pool-covers\">Dohenyâ€™s</a> also offers an eight-mil option that is more durable.  Being so thin also makes it less effective and less durable at trapping heat in pools when compared to thicker Doheny&#39;s BlueBlue covers. Doheny&#39;s offers a one-year warranty for this solar cover. Overall, the solar cover can only be used for a single swimming season and is best considered as an entry-level pool cover to demonstrate the effectiveness of Doheny&#39;s Clear-Tek covers.","The solar cover can raise the temperature of your swimming pool by 15 degrees Fahrenheit. It achieves this by allowing the passage of sunlight, trapping thermal energy in the pool and reducing heat loss. The bubbles on the underside of the solar cover are air pockets that prevent heat loss and serve as an insulating layer between the water in the pool and the air blowing over it. In addition, the air bubbles trap heat and slow down the rate of nighttime cooling. These bubbles are the primary mechanism by which most solar blankets keep swimming pools warm.","Doheny&#39;s makes this blanket in three colors: blue, Clear-Tek clear and a Clear-Tek blue that is half blue and half clear. While colored pool blankets make swimming pools colorful, they are not as effective as clear blankets at heating pools. Clear pool covers are transparent and, unlike colored blankets, they do not absorb any part of the incident light spectrum. Therefore, they deliver more sunlight to heat the water in a pool. To enjoy the benefits of a clear solar pool cover and the aesthetics of a traditional blue pool cover, Doheny&#39;s provides the Clear-Tek blue blanket.","The Doheny&#39;s BlueBlue Solar Cover is a rather thin solar blanket with a short warranty. However, it benefits from the combined heat-retaining effects of air bubbles and Clear-Tek&#39;s clever color schemes."]},"id":"280b5439-03d8-4954-9585-0fd5a5abea67","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63263","url":"/dohenys-5-mil-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T20:01:14Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T20:01:14Z","name":"Doheny's 5 Mil BlueBlue","synopsis":"The Doheny's BlueBlue Solar Cover is a thin round solar blanket for curved swimming pools.
