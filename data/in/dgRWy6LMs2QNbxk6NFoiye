The design and number of grooves contributes to the tire’s overall ability to remove water and retain traction in any driving condition, especially those that could cause hydroplaning. Combined with a multi-pitch tread and rib-shaft design, it improves both ride comfort and life of the tread. As a result, few consumers experience tire failure before the end of the 60,000-mile tire life.","Much like any general tire, the Dunlop Grandtrek AT20 finds its success in the aggressive all-season tread design. The circumferential grooves pump water away, while the sipes help in snow-on-snow conditions. The tread arrangement and rib-shift design facilitates reduced road noise and improved tread wear. In addition, the open-shoulder design and its deep lateral grooves deliver all-weather traction with relative ease. The tread design and compounds focus largely on wet road conditions rather than snow, though the tire still retains much of its traction in light snowy conditions.","One element to note is that this tire isn’t designed for heavier trucks or SUVs. Such large vehicles can reduce the tread life of the tire drastically, whereas smaller vehicles such as the Toyota Tacoma and 4Runner, prove to be an ideal size and experience the greatest results in regards to tread life and traction. The tires are rated for carrying a maximum load of approximately one ton, which leaves little room beyond the weight of a small SUV and its and passengers.","The Dunlop Grandtrek AT20 utilizes a wide range of tread design features, from circumferential grooves to crosscut sipes. Each of these helps in creating a smooth, quiet, and safe ride, aspects that many consumers note with this tire. This tire delivers a lengthy tire life, and oftentimes exceeds expectations due to the treads’ ability to reduce gradual wear and tear."]},"id":"9a40b7c7-be02-474e-9b82-6256842a053e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58240","url":"/dunlop-grandtrek-at20-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-19T20:23:22Z","datePublished":"2013-11-19T20:23:22Z","name":"Dunlop Grandtrek AT20","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
