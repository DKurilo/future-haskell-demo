However, it has a few downsides, like not being able to record video or snapshots to an SD card. While the VTech VM333 is not be the best baby video monitor on the market, though, it still has plenty to offer.","While the 2.8-inch screen isn&#39;t as large as the screens of some competing products, it&#39;s still big enough for you to easily see your baby. The middle-of-the-road quality of the screen doesn&#39;t earn it any bonus points, but it&#39;s functional enough. The manufacturer claims that the VM333 has a transmission range of up to 1,000 feet, but keep in mind that most manufacturer tests are done in ideal conditions out on an open field. With walls and other obstructions between the device&#39;s camera and parent unit, you&#39;ll see a much smaller range.","The monitor&#39;s screen has a signal indictor that tells you how strong the transmission is. You&#39;ll get a better-quality video stream with a stronger transmission. One of the most appealing features of this baby video monitor is its two-way talk capability. This allows you to talk to your baby through the parent unit, which can be useful for soothing the baby. You can also play lullabies that are built into the VM333 to soothe your baby.","Due to the VM333&#39;s VOX functionality, you can expect the device&#39;s battery to last through the night. The manufacturer claims that you can get six hours of continuous use before the battery dies. With the VOX enabled, the battery lasts much longer.","This baby video monitor comes with a one-year warranty, which should give you plenty of time to notice any manufacturer defects. You can contact support through email or by phone. In case you have any immediate issues, a manual is available online."]},"id":"a3e26d04-1f54-485a-b5a4-0c79f956b907","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9a43db8c-e273-497a-bd1f-3b5d09d9d4e3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The VTech VM333 isn&#39;t the best video baby monitor you can get, but it&#39;s not too far off either.

However, if you want to record video or snapshots of your baby, you&#39;ll need to find another device to do it.
