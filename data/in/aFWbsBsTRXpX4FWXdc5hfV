With screens that toe the line between phone and tablet – hence the &#34;phablet&#34; moniker – the Note series offers big viewing spaces and powerful components in a device you can still carry in a purse or coat pocket. The Galaxy Note 4 is the latest and greatest in Samsung&#39;s oversized series.

At 6.21 ounces, it&#39;s heavier than almost every other smartphone or phablet on the market, and that&#39;s despite a plastic chassis and rear cover. We don&#39;t particularly mind the weight – you tend to expect it with a phone this big, after all – but it&#39;s still noticeable.","Samsung made the decision to switch out its historically plastic rims for aluminum trim. While the changes are an aesthetic improvement, they&#39;re also uncomfortably sharp in your hand. The rear cover, meanwhile, remains as flimsy as ever. It&#39;s not as creaky as prior models, which we attribute to the sturdier trim and glass face, but it remains chunky, its shoulders a bit too broad for comfort.","Like many Android flagships these days, the Note 4&#39;s screen is full QHD: 2560 by 1440 pixels, giving you four times the real estate of a 720p screen. At 5.7 inches from corner to corner, it&#39;s quite spacious, and those pixels are tiny enough that you&#39;ll never see them without a magnifying glass. In fact, the screen is excellent, bright and vivid from every angle, but the display&#39;s glass is recessed within the phone&#39;s plastic trim. This creates a rough, uncomfortable edge whenever you&#39;re swiping from side to side.","Its physical construction may be a low point for the phone, but the Note 4&#39;s design includes something unique to the smartphone landscape: the S Pen. A stylus that fits snugly inside the phone when not in use, the S Pen turns your Note 4 into a handwriting-recognizing machine, much like the Palm Pilots that predated smartphones. It&#39;s not just for jotting down notes, though; you can use the pen to draw multitasking windows on the screen. Need to open up the calculator? Draw a rectangle on the screen, select the Calculator app from the menu that appears, and it will fill the rectangle. You can move your newly opened window, minimize it, maximize it or overlay other windows that you&#39;ve drawn. The feature seems small at first, but it can transform how you think of multitasking on your phone."]},"id":"5b201485-bdc6-459a-a9c0-a1d86b9a18d1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"93460d8e-79a0-4a23-a021-982b73b2aa9f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/yNDbZ9d4dFVsa5qqS7r8BD.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/55413-samsung-galaxy-note8.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yNDbZ9d4dFVsa5qqS7r8BD.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"yNDbZ9d4dFVsa5qqS7r8BD","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yNDbZ9d4dFVsa5qqS7r8BD.jpg","alt":""},"id":"d5c89e09-3444-4f23-abd2-ba37ad9403f4","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We took the Galaxy Note 4 out for a direct camera comparison with the Motorola Droid Turbo and the Sony Xperia Z3, and were delighted by the Note 4&#39;s performance. Between its consistently lifelike color reproduction, its phenomenally crisp focus, and the QHD display serving as an excellent viewfinder, we&#39;re ready to call it the best smartphone camera you&#39;ll find in an Android device.","By the numbers, it seems like any other smartphone camera: a 16-megapixel sensor, an ƒ/2.2 aperture and a classic single-LED flash. But as Apple has proved time and again, better numbers don&#39;t always mean better pictures, and the same holds true for Samsung&#39;s latest. Where other phones tended to overexpose sun-drenched landscapes, the Note 4 kept tones even. Where other phones shifted too far into warm colors, the Note 4 kept them neutral, better echoing the true palette of each scene. We photographed running water on default settings with all three phones, and only the Note 4 managed to capture the scene crisply.","The Note 4&#39;s front-facing camera is also impressive, though not as much as its specs might proclaim. Its 3.7-megapixel lens is significantly better than your average front-facing camera, and is able to take 1440p video. However, the shots it takes are noticeably grainy next to the superb photos that the rear camera manages to capture."]},"id":"6f12781f-f98e-4e71-849c-466b8fc387d3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Camera"},"id":"a2104f6e-9300-440b-ab3e-51a4266bef9f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Galaxy Note 4 has a screaming-fast processor.

The chip is a 2.7Ghz quad-core and is mated with a full 3GB of RAM, which is why the Note 4 can multitask so well without slowing down. Unfortunately, of its 32GB of internal storage, only about 24GB is usable space; the rest is taken up by the Android operating system and Samsung&#39;s graphically heavy TouchWiz interface.

Communications technologies such as Bluetooth 4.1 and 4G LTE connectivity come standard.
