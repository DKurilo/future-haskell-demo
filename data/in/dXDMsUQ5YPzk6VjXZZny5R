This card is designed to provide them with experience managing their own finances. Since it is designed for young adults and not meant to serve as a substitute for a checking account the way other prepaid debit cards are, the features and other offerings on this card are slim.","There are three different plans to consider if you choose UPside Visa as your reloadable debit card. The UPside Clear plan is free to use; there is no cost for signing up or a monthly fee. This plan is the most basic and has a low balance, no access to ATMs and no direct deposit option. The UPside Access Plan allows cardholders to use ATMs and direct deposit and has a higher maximum balance. This plan does have a monthly fee. UPside Edge has an annual fee that can be refunded based on card activity and has all the features of the Access plan.","In addition to whatever account fees your plan requires, you have to pay a fee for withdrawing funds from an ATM. This fee is on the lower end of the cards we reviewed, but UPside is not part of any ATM networks.","This card is light on features, which simplicity may be nice if you&#39;re looking for a card for your child to use to make purchases. This card does allow for online account management but does not offer text alerts or a smartphone app. UPside does offer a rewards program that gives points when money is loaded onto the card or for sponsoring friends who apply for the card. These points can be redeemed for cash back.","Money can be added to your UPside card through bank transfers, MoneyPaks and, depending on what plan you&#39;ve purchased, direct deposit. This card has one of the smaller maximum balances of the prepaid debit cards we reviewed. There are also restrictions on the amount of funds that can be added through direct deposit and withdrawn from ATMs.","The UPside website provides a FAQs section, and if you have further questions, you can contact UPside through email or phone."]},"id":"7319689a-a8a7-4cd9-bee1-982aeb26b6a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"55c0ac05-699c-4673-8573-33bd8f129e62","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["UPside is a prepaid debit card that parents provide to their teenagers or college-aged children.
