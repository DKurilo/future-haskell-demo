Since then, Skull Shaver has introduced its next-generation series of shavers, which includes the <a href=\"/pitbull-silver-review\">Pitbull Silver</a>, <a href=\"/pitbull-gold-review\">Gold</a> and <a href=\"/pitbull-platinum-review\">Platinum</a> shavers. While these newer products feature some upgrades over the Bald Eagle Smart-G – including better blades and improved water-resistance – it is still a top performer.","The Bald Eagle is marketed as a head and face shaver. It has five flexing shaver heads with rotary blades, and you can shave in any direction. Because of its patented design, it doesn’t cause cuts, nicks or burns. Also, the shaver contours to the shape of your head, face or neck to help you get a close, even shave.","“I feel patriotic using it,” joked one of our testers. “It’s really a nice and quick option.”","Shaving with the Bald Eagle is efficient because you can grip it in a variety of ways. Like the <a href=\"/hyperflex-verso-review\">Remington HyperFlex Verso 3</a>, it fits nicely in the palm of your hand, and you can also hold it between your fingers. Its motor has a powerful whir, turning at up to 10,500 RPM.","The Bald Eagle Smart-G is cordless and has an LED battery life display. It can run for 90 minutes before its battery must recharge, which takes two and a half hours. With worldwide voltage adaptation, this shaver accommodates international travel, and it comes with a durable travel case.","It’s easy to clean the Bald Eagle because it comes with a Skull Shaver rinse stand. If you rinse often while shaving, the blades will self-clean as you go. If you shave wet, shaving foam is recommended, but shaving gel might clog the shaver’s blades.","Unlike the <a href=\"/remington-shortcut-review\">Remington Shortcut Pro</a>, which has a five-year warranty, Skull Shaver protects the Bald Eagle Smart-G for just one year. Customer service is available by email or phone, and there’s an excellent user guide online."]},"id":"bf8c9b66-369a-48ad-9182-2b49f115809c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69955","url":"/bald-eagle-smart-g-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-05-17T15:58:40Z","datePublished":"2018-05-17T15:58:40Z","name":"Bald Eagle Smart-G","synopsis":"Last time we tested electric head shavers, the Skull Shaver Bald Eagle Smart-G was our best pick overall.
