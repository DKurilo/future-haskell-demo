You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When you the compare the Amazon Echo&#39;s sound quality and connectivity options with the other <a href=\"/best-wifi-speakers\">wi-fi speakers</a>  in our lineup, the Echo is a bit underwhelming. However, this speaker  has a few impressive innovations in its repertoire. Instead of being  merely a wireless speaker, this device can serve as a digital personal  assistant that can lend a helping hand when yours are full. With  smartphone integration and voice-command activation, the Amazon Echo  possesses advanced tech.","The Amazon Echo connects to your home network via Wi-Fi. You&#39;ll have  to download the Amazon Alexa application on your smartphone and follow  the setup instructions to complete the process. It is one of the  quickest wireless setups that we encountered in our testing. This  process only takes a few minutes to complete. Once the setup is  finished, you can begin to play with the voice commands.","The voice interaction between you and the device is what sets this  Wi-Fi speaker apart from others in our lineup. You activate the Echo by  saying the wake word, &#34;Alexa.&#34; A blue ring illuminates around the top of  the speaker letting you know Alexa is ready to fulfill your request.  For example, you can ask Alexa, &#34;What&#39;s the weather like today?&#34; The app  will respond to you with the weather report for your current location.  You can play music from various sources, including Prime Music and  Pandora.","The Echo&#39;s volume works on a scale from one to 10. You can say,  &#34;Alexa, turn music down to a four,&#34; and the volume will decease down to  the desired volume. Alexa can also multitask. For example, if you are  preoccupied cooking dinner, you can ask Alexa to set a timer. If music  is currently playing at the time of your request, Alexa will pause the  music, accept your request then continue the music at the previous  volume. When the timer sounds, it will pause the music and sound the  timer until you request Alexa to stop, then the music will continue. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"5433fe24-d890-4ece-a5c0-be5457d8d883","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Unfortunately, sound quality isn&#39;t exceptional from the Echo. It gets  loud enough to fill a small room or kitchen, but when compared to the <a href=\"/sonos-review\">Sonos PLAY:5</a>, the sound quality is lacking. We  listened to a plethora of different artists and genres on the Echo and  compared it to other speakers in our lineup. The two words that best  describe the audio quality are &#34;weak&#34; and &#34;tinny.&#34; The Echo doesn&#39;t have  much bass to offer and doesn&#39;t sound nearly as full as other speakers  in our review.","The other issue you should keep in mind is its lack of connectivity.  Outside of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, the speaker offers no other form of  connectivity. Many speakers in our review offer aux ports and USB  connectivity. The Echo lacks these inputs.","The Amazon Echo is small and nonintrusive. You can easily tuck it  away in a corner without taking up much room at all. Some of the  speakers we reviewed are rather large and require a good amount of  space. Its small size and 2-pound heft make it easy to place just about  anywhere in the house."]},"id":"cd54418c-02a2-4967-a252-e6b9ac87b4b9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8c397a8d-2440-442c-9b0b-a7d4ba24764f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We can recommend the Amazon Echo for its hands-free use and for the services it provides, although not for its sound quality.
