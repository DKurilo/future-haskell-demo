Of this we can be sure: If you are defending the goal against multiple attackers, your luck is going to run out before the attackers&#39; luck runs out. Furthermore, if you are defending multiple hacker targets in the form of a PC, a Mac, an iPhone, an iPad or an Android device, the bad guys have a vast attack surface to exploit at your expense.","Hackers expect you to have PC security software on your Windows computers. If you are running a Mac, cyber criminals know that there is less than a 50-percent chance you have it buttoned up with computer security software, which is one of the reasons that hackers no longer ignore Macs. Furthermore, if you use tablets and smartphones, hackers will gamble with confidence that it is highly unlikely that you have secured them in any way. Symantec&#39;s Norton 360 Multi-Device competes successfully at the head of the class of computer protection software that secures multiple devices with a single product purchase. A multi-device bundle is the best computer protection approach if you see the benefit of making one purchase from one vendor with one renewal, one support team and one web console to manage each device."]},"id":"6700b768-d21e-4f20-a2fa-ce8b3f30fe8b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"b92a1c18-6563-4a31-a55a-eef6cb858cea","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/9q8RgstJE7d95q7aDaUWYk.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Norton knows how to protect your computer, whether it is Windows or Mac.
