You can still read our original review below, but TopTenREVIEWS is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","<br/>The Toshiba DVD Recorder DVR670 is a <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">DVD/VCR combo</a> unit that ranks in the top tier of this converged technology. Both DVDs and VHS tapes had their day in the sun, and now they&#39;ve been eclipsed by high-definition Blu-ray Discs and streaming video content from the web. However, there are still a wealth of these old media formats in people&#39;s homes and fewer and fewer options to play them. Toshiba does a good job at keeping these technologies alive in the world of HDTVs, iPads and Hulu.","Not much has changed in the way of the standard-definition images DVDs and VHS tapes contain. However, television manufacturers have all but abandoned standard-definition TVs in favor of their high-definition successors. Toshiba tackles this problem by including both 1080p upconversion and progressive scan technologies. The upconversion part of the equation scales standard-definition images upward so they can realize the full potential of the millions of pixels on an HD television screen or monitor. Progressive scans fill in the empty portions of the picture so it appears clearly on the screen.","This DVD/VCR combo also has the ability to play rewritable media from the DVD drive. Supported formats include DVD+R, DVD-RW, CD-R, CD-DA, SVCD, DVD+RW, CD-RW, DVD-R and VCD.","Toshiba failed to include support for Dolby Digital sound on this DVD/VCR combo player. This is unfortunate because it means the rich picture quality that the company endeavored to create with the upconversion and progressive-scan components won&#39;t be complimented by rich sound.","Also absent from the unit are the ability to display subtitles and multi-angle camera selection. The former is probably the more egregious omission of the two because it makes the unit nearly useless to the hearing impaired. The latter oversight is a feature few users take advantage of, but its inclusion would still have been a plus in our book.","The VCR component of the Toshiba DVD Recorder features a four-head hi-fi video player. This is top-of-the-line (such as it is) VCR technology. If your VHS tapes are still in good condition, there is no reason the Toshiba DVD Recorder shouldn&#39;t play them flawlessly.","In addition to playing the aging VHS and DVD formats, the Toshiba DVD Recorder offers a haven for content trapped on magnetic tape. The two-way dubbing features on the VCR allows the DVD component of the machine to record images and sounds on VHS tapes and burn them to a DVD. This feature is invaluable for users who have yet to back up their old media on a digital format.","The Toshiba DVD Recorder is one of the few DVD/VCR combo units on our side-by-side comparison that includes every connectivity option we look for when we ranked these products. The back panel includes terminals for HDMI, coaxial, component, S-Video and more. This wide variety of connection options allows you to connect this machine to almost any monitor or television.","The warranty for the Toshiba DVD Recorder is the standard 12-month term the company offers for nearly all its consumer electronics. If you ever have a problem with your unit, Toshiba provides email, phone and online support options. Wrestling with Toshiba&#39;s phone tree can be difficult, but you&#39;ll eventually reach someone who can help you."]},"id":"81c3ceef-78b3-4feb-abeb-74c00d0b69fd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"29471881-c872-4c27-9b44-a729886fe688","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Toshiba DVD Recorder DVR670 is a fine DVD/VCR combo unit.
