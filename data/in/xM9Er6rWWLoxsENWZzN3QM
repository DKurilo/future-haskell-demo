It sells a complete line of equipment and DIY alarm monitoring that has works seamlessly with alerts to keep your property protected 24 hours a day. LifeShield has many useful tools that can help you set up your system.","You can customize LifeShield with a full assortment of DIY home security equipment. This make it easy to secure your home with sirens, pet-immune sensors, glass-break sensors, panic buttons, garage door sensors, recessed door sensors, motion detectors and security cameras.

LifeShield&#39;s alerts help protect and secure against smoke, fire, burglars, carbon monoxide, medical emergencies, flooding, power failure and freezing temperatures. These alerts are the best part of LifeShield&#39;s DIY alarm monitoring service. The system can&#39;t detect natural gas leaks, but this is a minor imperfection.","LifeShield&#39;s DIY home monitoring services require a three-year contract, the longest in our review. The monitoring plans use an internet or cellular connection to continuously monitor your home. LifeShield allows you to monitor and control your system via smartphone or web browser without charging an access fee. Most DIY home monitoring systems charge you extra for this feature. This DIY home security system is not compatible with home automation features.","As you prepare to install your equipment, you can look up informative tutorials and FAQs on the LifeShield website. LifeShield can schedule a professional installer to come by your home at no additional charge if you don&#39;t have the time to install the system on your own. If your equipment malfunctions, you can call and email LifeShield support. This company only offers a one-year warranty on its equipment, which is only a third of your contract.
