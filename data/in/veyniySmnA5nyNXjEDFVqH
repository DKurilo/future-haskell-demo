This HDV camcorder possesses a mini video light which allows the photographer to shoot objects up to 4.9 feet away in low-light areas. This video capturing device was ideal for these low-light conditions and we were pleased with the results.","This Canon product also has a 3.89MP full CMOS sensor. This sensor features low noise technology that produces clear, crisp images. The low noise technology available on this HDV camcorder makes it possible for the pixels, in low lit scenes, to appear clear with little noise. We found this sensor impressive but not extremely advanced.","A DIGIC DV III image processor is available on this product. This processor targets the color quality on the device to bring out the brightest and most vivid colors. This processor also contains a noise reduction system which additionally helped perfect images in those low-lit areas. The DIGIC DV III is one of the most sophisticated pieces of equipment on this Canon product because it also includes face detection capabilities, and an auto exposure system. We felt that this processor gives the Canon Vixia HF21 its competitive advantage."]},"id":"aa66af77-1673-409b-8467-3d972b1a8886","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"5d596879-312b-4a31-b82c-bb19f09245f8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Canon Vixia HF21 is a dual flash memory camcorder. This means that it can record onto a large 64GB internal memory or onto a removable SDHC media card. The ability to capture video on both the internal memory and the SDHC card gives you several benefits. By using the 64GB of internal memory, up to 24 hours of HD video can be recorded. However, by using the SDHC card, the captured video or images can be easily transferred to a computer for viewing or editing purposes. We were grateful to discover that if video is captured onto the internal memory, it can be copied onto a media card."]},"id":"1dc8f5fa-7382-46c7-8a37-0a81f7046972","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Editing &amp; Extras"},"id":"7fa908d6-7754-4170-9c9d-ecbd1bbafd81","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["One of the standout features on the Canon Vixia HF21 is the compact, simple and lightweight design of the HDV camcorder. Canon claims it is one of their smallest and lightest camcorders. The size of the device is ideal if you enjoy traveling and hope to carry your image capturing device around with you. For such a small size, we were surprised at the features and the large memory it offered.","The lens on this HDV camcorder pretty average, but the device comes with four zoom speeds, which makes it possible to get good close-up shots. In addition, there is a spectra coating technology which gives the user images with little flare and ghosting.","The shortcuts on this HDV camcorder make shooting on-the-fly quick and easy. The Canon Vixia HF21 contains a quick start once the LCD plane is opened. Also, the pre-record feature allows you to place your Canon camcorder in a pre-roll mode that, once you press the &#34;shoot&#34; button, records three seconds of the action which took place before you pressed the button."]},"id":"422c6680-7c19-421c-aa13-400356459cbe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aaf9284d-15dc-4adb-bb54-e89247459a6a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Canon Vixia HF21</strong> is a top-notch HDV camcorder with several advanced features.
