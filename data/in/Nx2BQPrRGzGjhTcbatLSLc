You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The 882 is Testo&#39;s premium offering for single-handed <a href=\"/best-infrared-cameras\">infrared cameras</a>. It features top-of-the-line image resolution, thermal precision and a number of extra features that increase its functionality.","The Testo 882 matches the highest resolution currently available for any single-handed thermal infrared camera at 320x240 pixels. With this level of clarity, it&#39;s simple to spot overloaded circuits or zoom in closer on an image to get a better look at specifics. A built-in digital camera allows you to take normal photographs at 640x280 pixels and combine them with your thermal images for greater levels of detail.","For focusing, this thermographic camera gives you two options: manual and auto. Autofocus uses a motor to automatically focus on your target, while the manual focus option allows you to customize the focus to your liking.","The infrared detector produces radiometric images with embedded thermal information in an uncommon BMT format. While this allows you to view temperature information, it requires special viewing software. This can be somewhat inconvenient if you&#39;d like to share your images with someone because you&#39;ll have to convert the images first. Some cameras use radiometric JPGs instead, which require no conversion.","While you can record infrared video with the Testo 882, it must be plugged into a computer via USB, and doesn&#39;t actually record the temperature information. You&#39;ll have the visual infrared information, but no numerical data.","Unlike top-tier offerings from other brands, the 882 has only a small number of auxiliary features. It has an onboard flashlight to illuminate darkened areas where you may be working and voice annotation capabilities to help you make notes about specifics in your images. That&#39;s it though. There&#39;s no Wi-Fi, no laser and no applications for sharing information with a mobile device. The upside is that you get excellent resolution for a lower price than comparable models.","Another sacrifice the 882 makes is the omission of a second battery and external charger. Instead, it comes with a single Li-ion battery that lasts about four hours and must be charged within your thermal camera. Extra batteries and external chargers are available, but that&#39;ll cost you extra. If you don&#39;t need to use your thermal imaging camera for more than four straight hours at a time, going with the 882 might be a good way to save some cash.","Testo offers a two-year warranty with the 882 to protect you against defects in the detector, battery or parts and labor. Testo also accepts infrared cameras for recalibration to keep your device functioning as accurately as possible. If you require further support, downloadable product literature as well as contact information is readily available on the company website.","The Testo 882 is a thermal-imaging camera that puts image resolution above all else. While it makes sacrifices in some areas to retain its relatively low price, it&#39;s definitely worth considering. It&#39;s especially appealing if you&#39;re unsure that you would make use of those missing auxiliary features and add-ons."]},"id":"fd12ae4a-f261-46d6-870e-df1ca34d3d99","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60720","url":"/testo-882-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"caleb-cross","url":"/author/caleb-cross","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Caleb Cross","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"MG9CFuiZaQn2UkqAVvekK9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-03T22:14:34Z","datePublished":"2014-10-03T22:14:34Z","name":"Testo 882","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
