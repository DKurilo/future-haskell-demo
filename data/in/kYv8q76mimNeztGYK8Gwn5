Keep in mind, however, that the comfort and convenience of electric head shavers can add value that outweighs their higher prices.","<strong>Maintenance</strong><br/><br/>Replacing the blades on your electric head shaver is important and should be done according to the instructions that accompany the shaver. Some manufacturers suggest doing so every five months while others say you can wait a year or more. Aside from replacing the blades, there are other steps you should take to maintain your shaver and make sure it’s always primed and ready to use. First and most importantly, always clean the shaver after every time you use it. This means blowing out any extraneous hairs and running warm water through the blades. Leaving even small, fine hairs in the mechanism can cause it to work less efficiently over time.","Always keep your shaver dry when you&#39;re not using it too to avoid any bacteria buildup. Not only can moisture ruin the shaver – it can act like a greenhouse for nasty germs you don’t want anywhere near your head or face. If you&#39;re concerned that the cleanliness of your head shaver has been compromised, disassemble it as much as you can and use a small amount of rubbing alcohol to clean it. If you have a model that is not waterproof, stick to using a damp cloth. Be sure never to use oil on your skin while you shave as this can get inside the shaver and cause damage and wear. Instead we recommend using gels, water or dry shaving. You should also charge your electric head shaver to capacity, use it, and then charge it to capacity again before storing it.","<br/><strong>Summary</strong>","Choosing the right head shaver can help you feel more confident in your bald hairstyle. Getting a fast, smooth shave without risk of bumps, nicks and cuts can give you a boost when you look in the mirror."]},"id":"8b7cdbb1-5540-444c-8410-ba4618297f84","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"8bd3f963-0689-4893-9620-ecc70235ab0d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/pitbull-gold-review\">Pitbull Gold Shaver</a>","<a href=\"/hyperflex-verso-review\">HyperFlex Verso</a>","<a href=\"/pitbull-silver-review\">Pitbull Silver Shaver</a>","<a href=\"/bald-eagle-smart-g-review\">Bald Eagle Shaver</a>","<a href=\"/wahl-bump-free-review\">Wahl Bump Free</a>","<a href=\"/panasonic-arc-4-review\">Panasonic Arc4</a>","<a href=\"/pitbull-platinum-review\">Pitbull Platinum Shaver</a>","<a href=\"/turnraise-review\">TurnRaise</a>","<a href=\"/remington-shortcut-review\">Remington Shortcut</a>","<a href=\"/philips-norelco-review\">Philips Norelco 7100</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3ea403a0-a4a2-4672-bf72-189531b9e100","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_186","url":"/best-electric-head-shavers","authors":[{"email":"jchristensen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-07T12:06:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-07T12:06:00Z","name":"Best Electric Head Shavers of 2019","synopsis":"We rated the overall design of each electric shaver as well how well (and quickly) each shaver could cut stubble and hair.
