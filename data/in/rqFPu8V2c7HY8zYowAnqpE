Overall, the performance was mostly comparable to the <a href=\"/pioneer-ts-wx1210a-review\">Pioneer TS-WX1210A</a>. It was tight and accurate, though not nearly as big.","The size of the bass doesn&#39;t compare to the 12-inch powered subwoofers simply because the 8-inch woofer can&#39;t move as much air. In addition, the woofer is nearly flat, unlike the deep scooping woofers of the larger 12-inch subs. That said, it still received a B+ grade for size â€“ the best grade for an under-seat subwoofer. As I tested it, the bass was big enough to move this 10 pound device across the floor. And since you literally put this subwoofer under your body, you feel it just as much, if not more, than the bigger subwoofers designed for trunks.","<strong>Power &amp; Control</strong>"]},"id":"8c26d654-2daa-45fb-81a8-d3569debd32f","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/WoEx9GRpDGGDVojLDCCL87.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The built-in amp is rated for 125-watts of continuous power.

With six controls, you can really dial the subwoofer into your car&#39;s acoustics and your personal preferences. The only downside is the lack of a remote. It has a port for a remote, allowing the driver to control the volume without reaching under the seat, but the remote doesn&#39;t come with the subwoofer. You have to purchase it separately.","As an under-seat subwoofer, the size is very good. Only the <a href=\"/kenwood-ksc-sw11-review\">Kenwood KSC-SW11</a> is smaller. With a height of about 2.75 inches, it should fit under most driver&#39;s or passenger&#39;s seats without much trouble. You can also put it under the bench seats or even in the trunk. However, the further you put it from the driver&#39;s seat, the less impact the smaller bass has and the lack of size in comparison to the larger subs becomes more obvious.","The Infinity BassLink SM earned my pick for the best under-seat subwoofer because of its tight performance and the big bass for such a small 8-inch subwoofer. It certainly doesn&#39;t feature the power or size of the 12-inch powered subwoofers, but this doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t feel it all the same. The control setup is very easy to use and provides exceptional tuning abilities.
