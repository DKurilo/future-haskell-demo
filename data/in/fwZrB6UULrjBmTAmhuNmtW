It creates a digital image from your slides, photos and 35 mm negatives. However, it will not convert other film sizes, such as 120 rolls.","Unlike flatbed scanners that use a slow moving bar to capture images, this unit does so instantly by snapping a quick shot. The 9 MP image sensor converts slides to a digital JPEG image in 10 to 15 seconds or less. Using an LED backlight that shines through the slide or film, the converter can render a clear shot of the image.","The 2.7-inch color LCD screen is located on the front of the unit, making it easy to view the images as they are created. This is also useful for cropping the pictures before you save them. The Pacific Image dust and scratch removal technology, Magic Touch, comes standard with this unit. Pacific Image is the only manufacturer that includes dust and scratch editing features in its devices. With Magic Touch, you can clean up damaged slides as you convert them, without using a computer or photo-editing software.","The Pacific Image ImageBox 9MP includes a TV-out jack and cable, so you can view your converted images on a TV. A USB cable is included as well, allowing you to transfer images to your PC. This converter is compatible with all Windows and Mac operating systems.","Because there is no integrated memory, you do have to use and SD card in order to save the images the unit converts. This converter unit comes with a USB cable, AC/DC adapter, filmstrip holder, slide holder and printed user manual.","Pacific Image offers a one-year warranty on all its converters. On the company website, there is a support page that provides a troubleshooting guide and FAQs. Additionally, there is a telephone number and an email address for technical support. In our communication with the company, we were impressed with the knowledge of the technical support personnel and their quick responses to our inquiries. Unfortunately, other departments were not as responsive."]},"id":"e2c57229-456a-4e88-a27c-8f5260d86d2d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"39fcba8c-62f4-4a6a-a427-067ad2561946","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pacific Image ImageBox 9MP is a good device if you need to convert slides to digital formats.
