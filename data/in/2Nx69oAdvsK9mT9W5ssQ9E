You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","One of the chief selling points of the Convair Millenia-Advantage indoor <a href=\"/best-portable-evaporative-coolers\">portable evaporative air cooler</a> is the fact that it can lower temperatures while using less energy than burning a single light bulb. Lightweight in build and designed for optimum mobility, it is among the best-selling portable swamp coolers on the market today.","Protected by a non-corrosive polymer casing, the Millenia-Advantage combines powerful cooling capabilities and energy efficiency with sleek aesthetic that is designed to be an unobtrusive addition to your home or office. Measuring 40 inches in height, it stands on four short legs with casters that promise to enable easy repositioning. Its weight of 28 pounds also adds to its portability. The front of the unit is made mostly of a large grille that facilitates widespread airflow.","The air cooler is equipped with a 1,000 CFM (cubic feet per minute) fan that can lower ambient indoor temperatures as much as 30 degrees in rooms up to 215 square feet. Like other portable evaporative cooling units, it requires only water and electricity to operate. The average power consumption of the Millenia-Advantage is 85 watts, which makes it a far more economically and ecologically sound alternative to traditional air conditioning. Most standard evaporative coolers consume roughly 10 times less power than A/C.","Bonus features include an Aspen filter that captures allergens and other particles, a quiet three-speed motor and a sweep-air motion fan that facilitates equal distribution of cool air. Although it comes with no built-in timers or remote control functionality, a control panel located on the top of the unit lets you adjust water flow from the 3.7-gallon tank for precise temperature control. Water flow can also be turned off to use the unit like a traditional fan.","Compared to other portable evaporative coolers of its size and price range, the Convair Millenia-Advantage packs powerful blowing capacity but lacks conveniences like a remote control, automatic timer, low water level alarm, and adjustable louvers. On the other hand, if you’re looking for a powerful fan with low power consumption and easy portability, the Millenia-Advantage could be your best choice."]},"id":"aecae464-c95f-485f-b939-9766bda32e8d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66097","url":"/convair-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-09T13:33:11Z","datePublished":"2015-07-09T13:33:11Z","name":"Convair Millenia-Advantage","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-07-09T13:33:11Z","id":"2Nx69oAdvsK9mT9W5ssQ9E","meta":{"title":"Convair Millenia-Advantage Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Lightweight in design, the Convair Millenia-Advantage portable evaporative air cooler burns less energy during operation than a single lightbulb.
