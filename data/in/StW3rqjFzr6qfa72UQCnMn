The DMCA makes no exceptions for circumventing these encryptions for personal use. Top Ten Reviews does not endorse piracy or any other illegal activity.</em>","Ashampoo Burning Studio advertises itself as a &#34;disc recorder.&#34; It allows you to do a number disc-authoring tasks, such as create music CDS, DVDs and Blu-ray discs. It contains a module from which you can copy Blu-ray movies. The application is quite useful, it has an easily accessible interface, but it falls just short of award-winning territory on our side-by-side comparison chart of the best <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-to-blu-ray-copy-software\">Blu-ray copy software</a>.","When you launch this application, the main window of the interface gives you access to all the program&#39;s tools and features. To make new copies of your Blu-ray movies, select the &#34;Copy Disc&#34; option from the main menu. The program then walks you through the copying process step by step. If you&#39;re performing a disc-to-disc copy, the process can take several hours, which may seem like a long time but wasn&#39;t uncommon in our tests.","Ashampoo Burning Studio can extract a disc&#39;s ISO file and save it onto your computer. An ISO file is a type of disc image that acts as the blueprint for an optical disc. When you have it on your hard drive, you can use it as a virtual disc that works with the Blu-ray player software. You can watch the movie on your computer.","It&#39;s also great for backing up and archiving your Blu-ray library. But since Blu-ray files are so large, you&#39;ll want to invest in a high-capacity external hard drive. This will ensure that you have access to the movies you&#39;ve paid for well into the future.","This program also allows you to use an extracted ISO file to make new copies of a disc, even if you no longer have the source disc. We used Burning Studio to burn a new copy of Blu-ray movie from a saved disc image. It took 42 minutes to complete the process, which is an average burn time among the applications we reviewed.","The final results of the copied disc Burning Studio created were perfect. Our video experts inspected each test disc and found the new discs to be identical to the source disc. With this Blu-ray copy application, you don&#39;t have to worry about any loss in quality or discs that are unusable.","What kept this program out of the top tier of our review, though, is that Burning Studio lacks the customization and compression tools we look for in the best applications. The <a href=\"/blue-cloner-review\">best programs</a> let you make a movie-only copy of a Blu-ray disc; others allow you to compress a large commercial Blu-ray movie to fit onto a smaller-capacity blank disc – or even onto DVDs. However, Burning Studio doesn&#39;t have these features, so you&#39;re limited to creating an exact replica of your Blu-ray movie and nothing more."]},"id":"a271587d-efc7-48ed-a9ee-fbc82596496a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"03fad7c7-ed39-4f2b-9a95-b2efd23f6551","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This software works as well as or better than most of the Blu-ray copiers we reviewed.
