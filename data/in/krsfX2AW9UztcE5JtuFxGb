However, <a href=\"/dvd-cloner-review\">DVD Cloner</a> is the <strong>TopTenREVIEWS Gold Award</strong> winning DVD copy software on our <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD copy software</a> site, while <a href=\"/dvdfab-review\">DVDFab</a> comes in at fourth place. The difference between the two, simply put, is that DVD Cloner is flawless in operation, while DVDFab has some small blips here and there. DVD Cloner also boasts a slightly longer list of features than DVDFab. At a cost around $40, DVD Cloner is almost $20 dollars less than DVDFab, which costs about $58.","The quality of DVD Cloner&#39;s copies surpasses all its competitors. It can copy almost any DVD to another DVD of the same format without any loss in quality whatsoever. DVD Cloner supports copying in several ways, including: DVD-9 to DVD-5, DVD-9 to DVD-9 (1:1), DVD-9 to two DVD-5 discs and DVD-9 to DVD-5 movie only. For an extra fee, DVD Cloner can even copy Blu-ray discs. DVDFab also delivers quality copies of DVDs. In fact, the quality of DVDFab&#39;s copied DVD files is better than most of its strong competitors. However, the copy quality is not perfect and cannot stack up against DVD Cloner. The only real issue is that DVDs burned using DVDFab have slight color distortions that you can see when you play them on large HDTVs.","The other area in the DVD Cloner vs. DVDFab match up where DVD Cloner really shines is features. For instance, DVDFab comes with a CSS decryptor, which is great because most DVD burning software suits have no CSS decryptors. CSS decryptors are advanced tools for decoding copyrighted DVDs. With DVDFab s single CSS decryptor, you ll be able to burn most copy-protected DVDs. However, DVD Cloner comes with eight built-in CSS decyptors, which is unmatched in the market. With this type of decoding force, you can burn pretty much every copyrighted DVD, even those produced by Sony and Disney, which are notoriously difficult to copy.","DVD Cloner and DVDFab both have several great features that many of their competitors lack, including the ability to burn episodic DVDs (TV shows), retain or change region codes and retain or omit footage and content such as trailers or bonus material. However, DVD Cloner has just a couple of extra standout features that put it at the front of the pack. For instance, DVD Cloner has the ability to recognize a disc&#39;s format automatically and presents you with the appropriate copy mode. DVD Cloner&#39;s Intelligent Analyzing Technology also ensures that copied DVDs split up the chapters, scenes and titles just as they are organized on the original DVD.","When DVD Cloner vs. DVDFab are evaluated for ease of use, they are both exceptionally user friendly. In this category, both software suites are neck and neck because both offer an incredibly easy installation process and both walk you through the DVD-burning process step by step.","The last consideration is price. DVD Cloner is about $20 cheaper than DVDFab and offers slightly more features and better copying quality, solidifying DVD Cloner s top spot on our TopTenREVIEWS DVD copy software site.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"722aef98-8326-412c-b60f-5f3af99b3807","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5884","url":"/dvd-cloner-vs-dvdfab","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-drew","url":"/author/jessica-drew","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Drew","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"rhh7ib7xwNCRKbyjPJTKmB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-04-29T16:41:28Z","datePublished":"2011-04-29T16:41:28Z","name":"DVD Cloner vs. DVDFab","synopsis":"In a comparison of DVD Cloner vs. DVDFab, which are DVD copying software packs that receive excellent marks on TopTenREVIEWS, both offer a wide array of functionality and deliver top-notch copying qua","review":{},"strapline":"In a comparison of DVD Cloner vs. DVDFab, which are DVD copying software packs that receive excellent marks on TopTenREVIEWS, both offer a wide array of functionality and deliver top-notch copying qua","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-04-29T16:45:37Z","id":"krsfX2AW9UztcE5JtuFxGb","meta":{"title":"DVD Cloner vs. DVDFab","description":"DVD Cloner and DVDFab are highly praised DVD copying software packs, but DVD Cloner takes the number-one spot for its extensive feature list and flawless copying quality."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:57:08Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/y2cxFn523i7N9mBMo3aMGm.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:08Z","mimeType":"","name":"5884-dvd-cloner-vs.-dvdfab.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5884-dvd-cloner-vs.-dvdfab.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:08Z","id":"y2cxFn523i7N9mBMo3aMGm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2cxFn523i7N9mBMo3aMGm.jpg","alt":""},"title":"DVD Cloner vs. DVDFab","description":"DVD Cloner and DVDFab are highly praised DVD copying software packs, but DVD Cloner takes the number-one spot for its extensive feature list and flawless copying quality."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/y2cxFn523i7N9mBMo3aMGm.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:57:08Z","mimeType":"","name":"5884-dvd-cloner-vs.-dvdfab.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5884-dvd-cloner-vs.-dvdfab.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:57:08Z","id":"y2cxFn523i7N9mBMo3aMGm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2cxFn523i7N9mBMo3aMGm.jpg","alt":""},"title":"DVD Cloner vs. DVDFab","description":"DVD Cloner and DVDFab are highly praised DVD copying software packs, but DVD Cloner takes the number-one spot for its extensive feature list and flawless copying quality."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/software/articles/dvd-cloner-vs-dvdfab/","label":"","tags":[]}
