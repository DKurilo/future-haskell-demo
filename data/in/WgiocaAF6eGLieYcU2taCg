This practice management solution offers a handful of tools for both your front office and clinical work and provides many additional features that enhance your practice and help it run smoothly. Curve Dental is a web-based solution so you don’t have to worry about data backups, compatibility issues and data loss. All the information you need for your practice is readily available at all times.","This dental practice management software met our full expectations when it comes to the front office and clinical tools it provides. This software is a full-featured application with tools to assist in the areas you need help with the most. You can schedule appointments, block out specific dates and times, and easily find available appointments.","There are a handful of billing features available in Curve Dental. You can create billing statements that are easy to understand, post payments and manage insurance claims. Your front office work will be much more simple with this application.","When it comes to the clinical tools this application provides, many options are available. You can easily create charts with just a few clicks of the mouse. You can view periodontal charts and entering data into the charts is a simple process. Additionally, you can enter extensive notes about procedures and work completed on a patient as well as upcoming treatment plans.","Curve Dental also offers many patient education videos. These videos help patients understand upcoming procedures and other important information about their teeth. The extent of the educational resources available from this service is excellent and constitutes much more than you will find in many similar products.","Curve Dental features a slick user interface. Many features, such as scheduling, can be accomplished using drag-and-drop functionality. When compared to similar programs, this dental software seems much more straightforward and advanced. It is crisp and finding features doesn’t take extended periods of time.","This dental practice management solution is a web-based program so you do not have to worry about hardware requirements and installing the software locally. However, it doesn’t offer instant messaging capabilities, which is a drawback. This tool would allow personnel at your dental office to communicate quickly and easily between workstations.","Email and telephone support are available for communicating with a Curve Dental representative. It took several days for a representative to respond to our multiple inquiries. However, the response we received was friendly and answered all of our questions but we were disappointed it took so long to receive the response.","There are also several online resources to help you find answers on your own. Webinars, a glossary and an info center are a few online resources available to you. However, we would like to see FAQs and live chat support provided for additional information."]},"id":"0f674975-c0c6-4864-b187-af53dc5f5202","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"03d7aeed-529a-4fe1-ab5f-a5f24ccf4dbc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Curve Dental has many exceptional benefits including a simple and enjoyable interface.
