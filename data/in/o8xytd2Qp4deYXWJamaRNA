For this latest review, we ordered eight prints from 10 companies, a total of 80 prints.","Our testers spent an hour evaluating each company&#39;s prints against the digital images we provided. They looked for color accuracy as well as the clarity of each print, comparing them with the original image and other companies&#39; prints.","Since our testers have backgrounds in photography and graphic design, we wanted to make sure they didn&#39;t feel partial to specific printing services. We concealed the names of the printing services and didn&#39;t disclose company names until scoring was complete.","We not only looked at print quality, but also the ease of using each service’s interface, the variety of photo gifts offered, the convenience of delivery or pickup, and customer service in general.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We carefully evaluated each company&#39;s print quality, user interfaces and photo gifts. Services that offered a large variety of print sizes and photo gifts scored better. Although we didn&#39;t score services based on their pricing, we did take note when a company was on the pricey side.","Since fast service is important, we paid particular attention to delivery and pickup options. Services providing overnight and two-day shipping scored higher than companies without those options. Companies providing in-store and same-day pickup were also scored higher.","To ensure the companies are user-friendly, we evaluated the help features of each service. Services offering tutorials and options for contacting customer-service representatives scored better.","We also contacted each company to determine how they responded to our questions. Companies that answered our questions in a fast, friendly and thorough manner scored better. Any company offering a mobile app was also scored higher, since an app adds to user convenience.","<strong>How Much Do Photo Printing Services Cost?</strong>","If there&#39;s one thing we learned from our years of testing and research, it&#39;s that there is no consistently inexpensive service. Let me tell you what I mean: you can find a 4 x 6 print for as little as $0.09 on one website but then find that the same service has one of the priciest options for 5 x 7 prints. Similarly, a company might sell the most expensive 4 x 6 prints and yet charge the least for a canvas print, so you shouldn&#39;t assume that your favorite service for ordering photo gifts is the most economical service for ordering prints and vice versa. Remember that you can find really good promos and discounts for prints and photo gifts near holidays, but you will want to give the company plenty of time to print your order if you purchase at these busy times; rush jobs near holidays will cost you extra.","To help you further, we&#39;ve broken down the average costs of the most commonly purchased prints and photo gifts based on the companies we compared:","4 x 6 Prints – We found that the least expensive companies only charged $0.09 per print while the most expensive company charged $0.29. This doesn&#39;t include the cost of shipping or taxes.","5 x 7 Prints – Individual prints ranged from $0.58 to $2.49. The most common price range being around $0.75 cents before tax and shipping.","8 x 10 Prints – We found the least expensive option was $1.59 per print, while the most expensive was $4.99. The average price was between $3 and $4 per print before tax and shipping was factored in.","11 x 14 Prints – The least expensive choice was $3.85 per print while the most expensive was $10.99. The most common price was about $8 before tax and shipping.","11 x 14 Wrapped Canvas Prints– The least expensive canvas print was only $29.99 while the most expensive was $89.99. The average price for a 11 x 14 canvas was between $30 to $60 before tax and shipping.","8.5 x 11 Photo Book – The least expensive price for a single 20-page hardback was $24.99, while the most expensive option was $70.00. Companies most frequently offered these books between $30 and $35. Keep in mind that prices will vary depending on the embellishments, number of pages and cover options you choose. Many companies offer large quantity discounts for photo books, but the discount will depend on the number of books you order. We recommend <a href=\"https://www.mixbook.com/\">Mixbook</a> as our best overall pick for photo books.","8 x 11 Calendar – The least expensive calendar option we found only cost $17.47 while the most expensive cost $34.99. Typically, companies sold 8 x 11 calendars for about $20 before shipping and taxes were factored in. Some companies will offer discounts if you order a large number of calendars at once. The discount will depend on how many calendars you purchase and the company you purchase through.","<strong>Important Factors to Consider When Choosing a Photo Printing Service </strong>","Storing &amp; Sharing<br/>Most photo printing services double as an unlimited <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/839-best-photography-sites.html\">photo storage site</a>. Since so many of your photos are on social media sites, it is smart to work with a photo printing service that can pull images directly from your Facebook, Instagram and other social media accounts. Plus, services that can pull photos from these platforms typically also make it easy to share your stored photos and albums on social media sites.","If you are constantly taking pictures and ordering prints, you might want to download a photo service app. Most apps allow you to order prints, but only some allow you to order photo gifts. If you think you&#39;ll be using the app regularly, you should find one that allows you to do everything you want.","Editing Tools<br/>Typically, every photo service will offer some form of editing capability. Some of the best ones include red-eye removal, cropping and the ability to adjust brightness and contrast. If you do crop an image, make sure the image is still high enough resolution that it will print well.","A photo’s print quality is tied to the printer that produces it. Most photo services have multiple printing locations around the U.S., which means the printing quality can vary. Find a service that works for you and offers the print sizes and gifts that you want.","<strong>Additional Gift Printing Options</strong>","Most printing services allow you to purchase a range of photo gifts that go beyond calendars, canvas prints and other basic paper products. For instance, many companies, like <a href=\"/walgreens-photo-center-review\">Walgreen’s Photo Center</a>, allow you to print photos on mugs, blankets, puzzles, decks of cards, coasters, furniture pillows and even iPhone cases. These make the perfect personal gifts for birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, Christmas and special events. The photo gift options will vary from one company to the next. Many printing services also allow you to create your own stationary like custom paper, envelope designs, notebooks and note cards. Services that offer custom stationary include several beautiful original designs to choose from, so you are likely to find something that works for you. You can also use <a href=\"/best-photo-cards\">photo card</a> companies to create custom wedding or party invitations, as well as thank you notes and greeting cards.","<strong>Best Printing Jobs in a Hurry</strong>","When you need to get prints of your favorite photos fast, picking up at a brick and mortar store is the way to go. Most companies will allow you to print at Walgreens Photo, CVS Photo and Walmart Photo. In our testing, Walgreens had the best print quality out of these three. Shutterfly had the second best print quality in our testing, and this service lets you pick up prints at your local Target. If you order directly at a physical Walgreens, CVS or Walmart, you’ll likely be able to have photos in hand within one hour of ordering them, whereas you’ll have to wait at least two days for processing and shipping if you order prints for delivery from an online store. Admittedly, two days isn’t very long to wait unless you’re in a time crunch and need your photos fast. Be aware that some sizes and print finishes are only available for mail order.","<strong>More Photo Printing Guides:<br/></strong>"]},"id":"479870bd-62c6-452d-b1d5-15083c4e2d2b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-photo-cards\">The Best Photo Cards</a>","<a href=\"/best-photo-books\">The Best Photo Books</a>","<a href=\"/best-photo-only-printers\">The Best Photo Printers</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"b9fdca80-a598-4e85-b392-91c461396645","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_72","url":"/best-digital-photo-printing-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T17:02:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T17:02:00Z","name":"Best Digital Photo Printing Services of 2019","synopsis":"We ordered the same photos from each printing service, in glossy and matte, to see how each service scored between the two finish types.","review":{},"strapline":"We ordered the same photos from each printing service, in glossy and matte, to see how each service scored between the two finish types.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-15T17:40:36Z","id":"o8xytd2Qp4deYXWJamaRNA","meta":{"title":"Best Online Photo Printing Services 2019 -
