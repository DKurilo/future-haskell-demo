Of course. Doing so gives you a sense of security. Your property won&#39;t be an easy mark for thieves.","The same is necessary for your computer; your internet connection leaves you vulnerable to hackers who want to access your financial and personal information. Some hackers may be after your high-speed connection so that they can send malicious viruses and worms, blackening your reputation. Other intruders have the power to destroy your operating system on a whim. How can you lock that computer door but still have the freedom to do your business online?","A solid firewall will help you stop intruders from accessing your system. You keep your internet link to the outside world but the outside world can&#39;t view you unless you want them to. With a firewall in place you will still have typical email access, but chat and other interactive programs will require you to take an extra step to grant access before you can use them. A firewall is powerful but unobtrusive, just like a deadbolt lock inside a door.","But unlike a single door to a home, the path to your computer data has two doorways. Some of your data is stored on a physical media storage device such as a hard drive, optical disk, thumb drive or some other form of media. The other method is your computer memory. An open door on either of these storage methods leaves your network and your data vulnerable.","Some of the most common methods to attack or view computer data include:"]},"id":"fed5ce2e-5072-42a6-9176-a659d97b8973","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":[""],"type":"ul"},"id":"38c4b6ff-bd77-4c1b-83c0-1736e6f9d14e","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["IP Spoofing - This form of attack occurs when someone outside your network spoofs (fools) your computer into recognizing the intruder as a trusted source--either a trusted internal source (by using an IP address that is within the range of IP addresses in your network) or a trusted external IP address that your system recognizes. This is like a stranger knocking on your door, claiming to be your long lost Uncle Joe. An IP address is like the computer&#39;s name, giving a computer a specific identity that other computers come to recognize.","IP spoofing only works when a hacker learns your IP address. The hacker then modifies the packet headers on his communications to your computer. A packet header is present in any transfer of computer data and is similar to a routing number on a check. The header guides the packet of data on its journey just as a routing number guides a check."]},"id":"78500551-e235-407e-aa68-2c08881d356e","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Password Guessing - This technique is often ineffective because it takes a long time to guess someone&#39;s password, even if the password is a common one. Attackers can either enter guesses manually or electronically.","Brute-Force Logon - This technique is essentially the same as password guessing, however, the attacker tries to quickly gain access to a user&#39;s username and password by using guessing tools to automate the process.","Password Cracking - This technique is more effective than the previous techniques.
