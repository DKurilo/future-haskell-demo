You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This substantial front load washer can be stacked with a dryer in case you live in a small dwelling or need more space. This 3.9-cubic-foot washer gives you a Ready Steam function to remove tough stains, 10 washing cycles, five different soil cleaning levels, a sanitizing cycle, and a special fresh-water rinse to really get white things white and remove even more allergens. If you need even a little more capacity, check out the <a href=\"http://www.toptenreviews.com/home/laundry/best-front-load-washers/kenmore-elite-review/\">Kenmore 41072</a>.","The Frigidaire FFFS5115PW works fast – you can do a full load in 20 minutes. It operates quietly so it doesn&#39;t disturb anyone who is napping or studying. An accompanying electric dryer for this <a href=\"/home/laundry/best-front-load-washers/\">front load washer</a> is the <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-4134430-10409817-1460478505000?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajmadison.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Fajmadison%2FFFSE5115PA.html%3Fmv_pc%3Dcj%26utm_content%3Ddatafeed&amp;cjsku=FFSE5115PA\">Frigidaire FFSE5115PA</a>, which provides a 7-cubic-foot drum, a quick dry function that even accommodates big loads, and a wrinkle release cycle that tumbles clothes without heat to cut down on wrinkling.","You have the choice of six wash and rinse temperatures on, including a sanitize option. The sanitize selection removes up to 99.9 percent of bacteria that can gather on your laundry. The Advanced Rinse Technology is also helpful for keeping your clothes extra clean. During the final rinse of the wash cycle, it uses fresh water, which reduces allergens remaining on the laundry and gives you even whiter whites.","Of its 10 wash cycles, there are some standard offerings and then some unusual features to suit your washing needs. You get a quick wash cycle that is a bit different from comparable cycles on other machines: This wash cycle can wash a full load of laundry in just 20 minutes. You also get helpful cycles that can handle heavy loads, bedding, delicate items and pure whites.","There is also a tumble action cleaning system with this washer, which you activate by removing the agitator from the interior of the machine. This protects clothing that needs a gentle wash and a thorough rinse.","Another great feature Frigidaire included in this front loader washer is a steam cleaning function that works well with different wash cycles to remove stubborn stains. You can add the steam option to certain cycles.","If planning your day shows you may not have the time to wait for the wash, you can use the delay start capability so that laundry will be washed, rinsed and ready for the dryer when it is convenient for you. This front loading washer also automatically saves your last washing setting as a time-saver.","A good companion dryer for this front load washer would be the Frigidaire FFSE5115PA. This is a spacious 7-cubic-foot electric dryer that comes with a steam cycle to eliminate wrinkles, a quick dry option and the ability to dry exceptionally big loads of laundry."]},"id":"08062720-ed16-408c-8a36-28566cbf08bf","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58381","url":"/frigidaire-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-09T21:55:41Z","datePublished":"2013-12-09T21:55:41Z","name":"Frigidaire FFFS5115PA","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":29,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-12-09T21:55:41Z","id":"EgAxXEU5ama6M7fEpXySgn","meta":{"title":"Frigidaire FFFS5115PA Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Frigidaire FFFS5115PA is a front loading washer with 10 wash cycles, including specialty settings.
