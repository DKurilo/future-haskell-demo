Some alert you with an audible signal that tells you to turn the machine off. Others shut themselves off when the cooking is finished. A few models even have a feature to keep the eggs warm until you&#39;re ready for them. Some electric egg cookers have a timer on the machine that you can watch, but the best models base cook times on how much water you put in the bottom of the machine and let you know when cooking is done. We did encounter some cookers with no alert system, which means you must watch the clock or time the machine with your phone, which is a nuisance.","Number of Eggs<br/>Another important feature is how many eggs a cooker can prepare at once. Electric cookers often hold up to 10 eggs in a cooking cycle. Microwave egg cookers, however, usually hold up to four eggs at a time. If you&#39;re cooking for a large family every day or you like to keep hard-boiled eggs on hand for a snack, having a cooker that can handle a dozen eggs at once can save you time.<br/><br/>What Does An Egg Cooker Cost?<br/>As kitchen appliances go, egg cookers are inexpensive. They tend to range from as little as $13 to as much as $40. We found that a high price doesn’t necessarily indicate good performance."]},"id":"c955fcf0-1f43-467d-93a2-5eb411da3415","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_214","url":"/best-egg-cookers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-15T12:47:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-15T12:47:00Z","name":"Best Egg Cookers of 2019","synopsis":"Steam cookers cook eggs without having a large pot of boiling water on a hot stove and microwave cookers offer quick cooking times.","review":{},"strapline":"Steam cookers cook eggs without having a large pot of boiling water on a hot stove and microwave cookers offer quick cooking times.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-14T17:38:25Z","id":"Ctxr22pu7sDGqDXcGyDz5D","meta":{"title":"Best Egg Cookers of 2019 - Boiled, Poached, Scrambled Egg Steamers","description":"Steam cookers cook eggs without having a large pot of boiling water on a hot stove and microwave cookers offer quick cooking times."},"products":[{"slug":"cuisinart-egg-central-cec-10","url":"/product/cuisinart-egg-central-cec-10","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","name":"Cuisinart Egg Central CEC-10","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","id":"ExrQnAa8omf5ZbcxYkfaPJ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"dash-rapid-egg-cooker","url":"/product/dash-rapid-egg-cooker","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","name":"Dash Rapid Egg Cooker","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","id":"Mn4eN6aVyUtUZBGHkt6gmP","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"hamilton-beach-25500","url":"/product/hamilton-beach-25500","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","name":"Hamilton Beach 25500","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","id":"BAvpfAHk3EzHDsptQXqe58","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"nordic-ware-egg-boiler","url":"/product/nordic-ware-egg-boiler","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","name":"Nordic Ware Egg Boiler","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","id":"ewW8PWKLkRmbpY9U27wtr9","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"elite-cuisine-egc-007","url":"/product/elite-cuisine-egc-007","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","name":"Elite Cuisine EGC-007","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","id":"WcXGMH5yZkTSpBVfUQQNAM","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/Gv95fwjGBGzPjaizfJhNA8.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Egg-Cookers-001.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/F/H/754829/original/Hero-Egg-Cookers-001.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","id":"Gv95fwjGBGzPjaizfJhNA8","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gv95fwjGBGzPjaizfJhNA8.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Egg Cookers of 2019","description":"Steam cookers cook eggs without having a large pot of boiling water on a hot stove and microwave cookers offer quick cooking times."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/Gv95fwjGBGzPjaizfJhNA8.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Egg-Cookers-001.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/F/H/754829/original/Hero-Egg-Cookers-001.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","id":"Gv95fwjGBGzPjaizfJhNA8","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gv95fwjGBGzPjaizfJhNA8.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Egg Cookers of 2019","description":"Steam cookers cook eggs without having a large pot of boiling water on a hot stove and microwave cookers offer quick cooking times."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"specialty-appliances","url":"/kitchen/specialty-appliances","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","name":"Specialty Appliances","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:09:58Z","id":"pjGYR2Qzeeo67PAvh7vTML","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
