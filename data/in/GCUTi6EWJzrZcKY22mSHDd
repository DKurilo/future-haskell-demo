You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The LG LDE3037BD is an <a href=\"/best-double-oven-ranges\">electric-range double oven</a>. It features a ceramic glass cooktop with five burners, convection cooking capabilities, and a handful of settings and features for making cooking easier. It also has a large touch control pad and ample cooking space.","This is one of the larger double ovens. Between the two ovens, it offers 6.7 cubic feet of cooking space. The upper oven is smaller at 2.32 cubic feet, while the lower oven provides 4.38 cubic feet. This double oven features convection cooking technology, which means a small fan inside the oven circulates the hot air, allowing food to cook more evenly and at a faster rate. It also features LG&#39;s InfraGrill technology. With this feature, the oven uses the same technology as outdoor grills and heats up quickly to the broil temperature.","The cooktop is electric and made from ceramic glass. It features five burners that range in size and power, from 100 to 3,000 watts. The center burner, which has only 100 watts of power, is designed for keeping food warm and does not have the power to cook.","You control the various settings and temperatures on the LG using a keypad on the back panel. You may have to reach over hot burners while cooking to reach this keypad, though this placement does put it out of reach of children.","This electric-range double oven provides convection bake and roast capabilities, though not convection broil, which is a more efficient alternative to traditional broiling. It also has a warming setting and a delayed bake option, which are beneficial on days when time is not on your side. However, there is no rapid preheat option to further save time or a built-in temperature probe to ensure you never serve undercooked meat.","This LG double oven is covered under a one-year manufacturer warranty. This is the warranty you find on most double ovens. However, a few double oven ranges are covered for two years or more, and the best available warranty is 10 years.","The LG LDE3037BD is an electric range with convection and LG InfraGrill technology to make cooking more efficient. It also has plenty of cooking space to help you cook a large meal in little time."]},"id":"39ec075b-b231-4377-aa19-95758321d8d9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67569","url":"/lg-electric-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-01-14T20:49:24Z","datePublished":"2016-01-14T20:49:24Z","name":"LG LDE 3037BD","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-01-14T20:49:24Z","id":"GCUTi6EWJzrZcKY22mSHDd","meta":{"title":"LG LDE 3037BD Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The LG LDE3037BD is an electric-range double oven with convection cooking.
