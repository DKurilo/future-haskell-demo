Homelite UT33650 Gas Trimmer is one of the least expensive and most basic <a href=\"/best-weed-whackers\">weed whackers</a> we reviewed. It works fine if you have a small yard, but it can’t handle much beyond that. This unit has some notable qualities but lacks the flexibility of weed whackers that can use attachments to tackle multiple tasks.","This gas trimmer operates on a 26cc two-cycle engine, which has a surprising amount of power for a budget weed eater. This engine starts easily and the entire trimmer weighs a mere 10.5 pounds, making it the second-lightest tool in our gas trimmer reviews.","Unfortunately, its light weight is offset by the lack of an anti-vibration feature, which fatigues your hands more quickly than others with this feature. It is best to rest your hands, wrists and arms occasionally when using this device to avoid muscle strain.","This trimmer comes with a grass deflector that minimizes flying debris as well as a bump-feed trimmer head, which makes it easy to add a new line with a quick bump on the ground after the old line wears away.","With a 17-inch cutting swath, the dual-line head does a good job slicing grass and weeds. You can adjust the handle on this gas trimmer to accommodate your height. Homelite does not offer landscaping attachments for the UT33650, so this would not be the string trimmer for you if you want to use attachments to edge your lawn or trim hedges. The <a href=\"/craftsman-gas-trimmer-review\">Craftsman 25cc 2-Cycle</a> is an affordable alternative that lets you add attachments.","Homelite&#39;s customer support can help you properly maintain this grass trimmer with two-year warranties that cover parts and labor and the drive shaft. For service needs, you can take the yard trimmer to a Homelite-recommended service facility, or contact Homelite by phone or email to find a repair service in your area."]},"id":"072646ee-b4db-4666-b6e6-f28cec7370a7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4c69aa7f-d299-4b25-a883-9ca52df22e3e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Homelite UT33650 Gas Trimmer is good for basic trimming.
