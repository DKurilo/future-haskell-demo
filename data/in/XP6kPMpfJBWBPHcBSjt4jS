Similarly, fireboxes are often sold individually so you don&#39;t have to buy a completely new fireplace. You can also create a custom mantel to hold an electric fireplace. The Real Flame 4099 model firebox meets all these needs. However, it&#39;s specifically meant to be used with Real Flame fireplace mantels. Mounting brackets and hardware are included for convenient installation.","This electric fireplace heater measures approximately 20 inches tall, 24 inches wide and 9 inches deep, and weighs about 30 pounds. The digital display shows what options have been set. For visual aesthetics, the control panel can be hidden from view. The electric fireplace insert can be programmed for temperature (displayed in Fahrenheit or Celsius) and length of operation (up to nine hours). You can regulate these settings using the included remote control or through the control panel directly on the unit.","If you&#39;ve set the timer, the electric fireplace heater automatically turns off when that time runs out. There are five brightness settings for the LED flames, ranging from dim to ultra bright. The ember bed is designed to change dynamically to mimic real burning logs. The flame can be used with or without heat.","The glass front of the Real Flame electric fireplace comes with a screen kit as an added safety protection. The unit is vent free, but the electric firebox requires clearance space on the top and back. Using 4,780 BTUs, the Real Flame 4099 has a lower heat output than other units, but it heats a 12 x 12 room (144 square feet). It also comes with a one-year limited warranty.","The Real Flame 4099 electric fireplace insert is a versatile unit. With this electric firebox, you can convert an existing fireplace to an electric fireplace, build a custom mantel and insert the Real Flame 4099, or use the insert directly in another Real Flame brand mantel. The control panel allows you to easily see the temperature output as well as the timed operation settings. The heat output is lower than other electric fireplaces, but for supplemental heat, the 4099 model is a good choice for smaller spaces."]},"id":"9ff88e7c-1b34-4ffd-a127-f22c59e0a27c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59386","url":"/real-flame-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-18T16:04:49Z","datePublished":"2014-04-18T16:04:49Z","name":"Real Flame 4099","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
