You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","How does lesser energy efficiency, smallish capacity and a $700 price tag sound? It did not sound great to us either. The Frigidaire FAFW3577KR <a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\">front load washer</a>  is underwhelming in some ways but still managed to make our top 10 based on some standout features.","In the first place, this style of washer will always look awesome when lined up next to your old top load washer. Always. This Frigidaire machine, along with most fellow front-loading washers, will automatically dispense bleach, detergent and fabric softener at the right time during each cycle. It will signal the end of each cycle and allow you to schedule a start up to 14 hours in advance. The design of this front-load washer makes it easy to add a rinse, too. We also like the drum light. We’re not really sure why this is not a standard feature on every front-load washer, but it is not. It is so easy to miss a stray sock wedged in a corner somewhere, and that could lead to a mildewed mess or at the very least an extensive sock search.","Even with those features, we think this Frigidaire unit fails on bigger issues, like energy savings. We think once you get into the $700 price range you should be able to expect pretty spectacular energy efficiency. That is not the case with this unit.","A few things that will make this Frigidaire washer easier to use include an available matching pedestal, digital display and a locking door. This machine also adjusts water levels automatically based on the amount of clothing in any given load.","We love the fact that you can run the same load of laundry over and over. This Frigidaire front load washer will remember the settings of your last load of laundry. You know which load you run over and over again, and your machine can too. Just hit one button and get the next load going.","This Frigidaire unit comes in a truly wide array of colors – white, black, red, blue and silver. This will be completely uninteresting to some consumers, but it is a nice to have so many color options for those that care.","As mentioned, we were underwhelmed by the energy savings, but that does not mean there is no savings at all. The Frigidaire FAFW3577K does bear the EPA’s Energy Star label and likely compares well to your old-top load machine. Yearly operating costs with an electric water heater will be only $19, or $12 with a natural gas water heater.","This machine is pretty standard in the customer support realm. The Frigidaire website is decent, though we wish they had live chat. The Frigidaire warranty for this machine is also just decent – a year of coverage on everything."]},"id":"349fb56f-a45f-4f2d-877f-068270cc4666","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4f5e46f0-42d7-4793-8e71-e0706ac8e8a1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Again, we stress that the Frigidaire FAFW3577KR will likely blow away your crusty old top-loader in virtually any category."]},"id":"a4fa065e-1242-488a-a08b-9b40c9876bd5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51093","url":"/frigidaire-washer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-12T21:10:54Z","datePublished":"2010-10-12T21:10:54Z","name":"Frigidaire FAFW3577KR","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":72,"verdict":"This machine should be better for its price.
