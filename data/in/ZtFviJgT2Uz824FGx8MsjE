The seat has a simple two-position carry handle, a reclining base and LATCH connectors. It has a weight capacity of 4 to 30 pounds, making it great for newborns, preemies and children close to 2 years old. It is compatible with three Quinny strollers, and its canopy folds away when not in use. As interesting as the Prezi is, though, it has a few awkward designs, the worst of which is its headrest that forces your baby&#39;s head forward.","Like all infant car seats, the Prezi is crash tested and meets federal safety requirements. The seat uses energy-absorbing foam and headrest padding to offer protection from a collision at any angle. In fact, the seat&#39;s base has an anti-rebound bar to reduce the energy of a front or rear collision. Although you can use the carrier without its base, you&#39;ll lose that extra collision protection. On the other hand, this is one of the largest seats we reviewed, and installing the carrier without its base saves you a couple inches.","The Prezi supports children as light as 4 pounds, so it is good for newborns and preemies. The base offers two recline positions: 4 to 11 pounds and 11 to 30 pounds. With its 30-pound weight limit, this rear-facing car seat should last most children up to two years, the amount of time the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends for this position.","The Prezi has a few issues. The cushions and fabrics are not machine washable, so if there is a mess, you&#39;ll have to clean it by hand. The canopy does a poor job blocking the sun or rain. However, the most troubling flaw is the awkward headrest. The headrest is at an angle and pushes your baby&#39;s head forward. When your baby is fully relaxed or asleep, his head will droop forward as you drive. One way to solve this problem is to place pool noodles under the base to increase the reclining angle and force your baby&#39;s head back."]},"id":"2619812a-22fd-4c75-8495-71bb7526bb91","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9fe53e30-b8e5-4aa2-9c41-002b885db3ce","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maxi-Cosi Prezi is a sturdy baby car seat with excellent safety and convenience features.
