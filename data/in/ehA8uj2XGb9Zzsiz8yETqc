You want to do everything you can to ensure your facilities and equipment remain in optimal condition and you aren t spending hundreds of dollars making unnecessary repairs. Preventive and predictive maintenance are two types of maintenance techniques that can help you stay on top of equipment failures and other facility losses. While many maintenance managers may prefer one type to the other, each one is important and plays a vital role when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-maintenance-management-software/\">maintaining your facility</a>."," "," ","<strong>Preventive Maintenance</strong>","Preventive maintenance entails performing a number of tasks on a regular basis to prevent large failures or losses from occurring. These tasks are designed to keep parts and machinery running smoothly and prevent any issues. Preventive maintenance tasks are similar to a routine inspection. These tasks are often scheduled into a calendar and occur every few days, weeks or months. Most often, you complete these tasks when machines are shut down and turned off.","Even though preventive maintenance is designed to ensure everything is working at its best, there are a few drawbacks to this maintenance option. For one, this type of maintenance takes employees and authorized personnel away from other essential tasks in order to regularly inspect equipment. Additionally, work that is not necessary may be performed. This has the potential to cause more harm than good and it is not cost effective.","<strong>Predictive Maintenance</strong>","Predictive maintenance requires much more preparation than preventive maintenance. With this type of upkeep, maintenance only occurs when it is necessary. You determine the necessity of the maintenance through data collection, use of certain technologies, tests, experiments and other methods.","For example, when using predictive maintenance techniques, you may not perform maintenance work on a piece of machinery until the machine s oil level, water content, or material output has been tested. If the machine fails at any operational tests, then certain maintenance tasks are likely needed.","Predictive maintenance can often save you money because tests are usually performed during regular operations anyways. However, if specific items are needed to perform the tests, this may require additional costs, which can be a drawback of this type of maintenance. In addition, performing the tests can be time consuming. Several of these tests can include vibration analysis, sound-level measurements, thermal imaging and more. The type of tests and equipment you may need will differ depending upon the facility, equipment, machine and even the test you need to perform.","<strong>Necessary Guidelines</strong>","Both types of maintenance are crucial for your facility to run smoothly and to keep your costs low. Without any type of maintenance plan or even a weak maintenance strategy, you will run into a multitude of problems resulting from damaged parts, ruined machines and a shut-down facility. It is also important to note that no matter whether you are performing predictive or preventive maintenance, you should follow a few best practices."]},"id":"102facfb-32ac-4309-8ebd-d6959b34b24d","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["The individual performing the tasks is qualified and honest, and has an ample amount of experience.
