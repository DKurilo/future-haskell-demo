is <a href=\"/best-encryption-software\">Mac encryption software</a> that protects your sensitive files and built-in applications alike. With this program, you can apply passwords to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your iPhoto, browser history, contacts and email. While this is a valuable feature, the bloated encrypted files can present a problem, and the software lacks some standard security features.","This software automatically locks when you close protected applications and uses a master password for its storage vaults. You can add these encrypted vaults to an external drive or network drive. This saves space on your computer and protects your files in case your laptop is stolen.","Space can be an issue with MacFort, though. In our file compression test, our 134.5MB file expanded into a 702MB monster. The best Mac encryption software keeps the file sizes the same to save you space, but some file growth is normal for encryption software. As a security measure, adding more information to the file conceals real content from the encrypted garble. MacFort gives you the option to encrypt with AES 128-bit or 256-bit encryption. These algorithms pad files, but only enough to increase the file by a few bytes, so the doubling in size is an unnecessary inconvenience.","The software&#39;s poor results in our speed test reflect the large file size. It took over 46 seconds to create a new vault for files in MacFort and just under 20 seconds to copy the small files into the vault. If the files encrypted in MacFort often grow to the sizes they did in our test, it&#39;s no wonder this program earned only a 50 percent speed score.","If you can keep track of your passwords, MacFort is easy to use. It earned a 70 percent score for ease of use in our evaluation, which is about average for Mac encryption software. The biggest issue we had with this program was the lack of password recovery. If you lock yourself out of your vault, there&#39;s no way to remind yourself of the original password. This is good for preventing theft, but bad if you forget your passcodes.","MacFort is a straightforward application with no extras. It lacks any password-strengthening features such as a password generator or strength meter. You can find these tools online, but having them in the application would save a lot of time. You can&#39;t delete sensitive files completely with this program either, because it lacks a file shredder.","Your Mac is compatible with MacFort as long as you&#39;re running OS X 10.7 or a later version. In terms of customer support, there are a few ways to find answers on the developer&#39;s website. It has a FAQs page, a blog with news on software updates, and three separate email contacts for general info, support and public relations."]},"id":"c54e1be3-0f23-45ae-8122-038f6a851cb2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5dd53b89-715e-46b9-b284-e448a9ba8c2c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["MacFort is the only Mac encryption software we encountered that lets you set passwords to the apps on your computer.
