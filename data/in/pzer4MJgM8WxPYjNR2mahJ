As such, the Siemens Pure has been discontinued. You can still read our review below but Top Ten Reviews will no longer update this product&#39;s information. </em>","Siemens Pure is a receiver-in-canal <a href=\"/best-hearing-aids\">hearing aid</a> that offers advanced features to help improve your quality of hearing. This hearing aid is designed for those with moderate to severe hearing loss.","With its small design, the Siemens Pure hearing aid has a receiver that sits in your ear, providing sound directly to the source. It comes in a variety of colors to match your skin tone and hair color so it seamlessly blends in, making it barely noticeable to others.","This aid comes with a telecoil feature that makes it convenient to talk on the phone by picking up only the noise within the telephone&#39;s receiver. This feature also comes in handy in facilities with induction loop technology, such as theaters, churches and other public buildings, as it transmits speech directly into your ears. This hearing aid also features tinnitus therapy to not only improve your hearing but to manage bouts of tinnitus effectively.","Equipped with BestSound Technology, this hearing aid mimics binaural listening, using both of your ears to detect sound, rather than just one. The result is clear quality sound that, when coupled with the unit&#39;s directional microphones, eliminates background and wind noise.","With Siemens&#39; touchControl App, you can use your Apple or Android smartphone as a hearing aid remote control for your Siemens Pure. Simply download the app to your phone and you can control your hearing aid&#39;s bass, treble, volume and programming. Additionally, you can use the easyTek app to transmit audio to your hearing aid from Bluetooth and other audio devices. The app converts your smartphone into a control center, letting you switch between devices like a TV or phone, or focus on a conversation in a noisy environment. If you don&#39;t have a smartphone, you can purchase the easyPocket remote control separately for the same functions.","The Siemens Pure features rechargeable batteries. When the batteries run low, you can insert the hearing aid into the eCharger case, sold separately, which takes six hours to fully recharge. You do need replace this unit&#39;s batteries about once a year. This hearing aid is IP67-rated and offers resistance to sweat, moisture, dirt and dust.","The Siemens Pure hearing aid is designed for those with moderate to severe hearing loss. Its advanced technology eliminates background noises, putting you in the heart of the conversation. You can also download apps that transform your smartphone into a remote control and interact with Bluetooth-enabled devices. This hearing aid has an IP67 rating, which means it&#39;s resistant to dust and protected against immersion in water up to a maximum of one meter for up to 30 minutes. In addition, because this unit is rechargeable, you eliminate the added expense of disposable batteries."]},"id":"b67e8651-ed2b-450f-a667-cc5ffc8bff3d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66642","url":"/siemens-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-21T20:45:52Z","datePublished":"2015-08-21T20:45:52Z","name":"Siemens Pure","synopsis":"Editor's Note: The Siemens brand has changed to Signia.
