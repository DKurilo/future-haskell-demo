The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-glucometers\">Glucometer Reviews</a> here.</em>","The Bayer Contour Next EZ meter is a glucometer that is quick to set up and start using. Known for its simplicity and ease of use, it&#39;s a good choice for anyone new to testing or those who don&#39;t need a lot of extra features.","A personal hi/low range setting lets you customize the Contour Next EZ meter to fit your specific needs. It accurately tests blood glucose levels between 20 and 600 mg/dL, but you can program in your typical upper and lower levels to help you quickly spot trends before problems develop.","The Contour Next EZ offers rapid test results of five seconds or less with a high degree of accuracy. The process starts with innovative test strips that utilize proprietary Sip-In sampling to absorb the necessary 0.6 microliters of blood to ensure accurate results on the first try. This blood glucose monitor then uses Bayer&#39;s Multipulse technology to evaluate the sample. This process repeats the evaluation of the blood sample six to seven times to ensure a more accurate reading.","Most blood sugar meters lose accuracy or stop working altogether at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher, but this one continues to give accurate readings up to an altitude of 20,650 feet. It does have temperature limitations and will not work properly when the temperature is 40 degrees F or less.","The Contour Next EZ meter isn&#39;t the smallest unit on the market, but at 3.03 x 2.24 x 0.74 inches, it&#39;s not considered large either, and it weighs just 1.7 ounces with the two CR2032 batteries installed. This no-frills glucometer has a black-and-white display that may not be as easy to read as some of the color screens found on other meters, but it does have the capacity to store up to 480 readings at any given time.","Bayer GlucoFacts Deluxe software is available on the Bayer website along with a series of how-to videos and other tools to help with nutrition planning and blood-sugar monitoring. The software is free to download and works on both PC and Mac operating systems. You do need to purchase a data cable to transfer data from the glucometer to your computer.","Bayer&#39;s Contour Next EZ meter is solid, yet simple. One concern for some is that it does not allow alternate site testing and requires blood samples taken from the fingertip. Test location aside, this is an easy-to-use glucose monitor with a five-year warranty and test strips that are readily available, making it a good choice if you are new to diabetic testing."]},"id":"1ea53c92-2488-43fd-bab4-4c9e38a6ed1b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60911","url":"/contour-next-ez-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-23T15:53:19Z","datePublished":"2014-10-23T15:53:19Z","name":"Contour Next EZ Meter","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
