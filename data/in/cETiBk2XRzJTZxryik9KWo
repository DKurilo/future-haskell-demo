Three cameras, modular accessories, a hot-swappable battery – LG has packed enough new and different in this smartphone to turn heads. There’s a stark contrast, however, between being unique and being worth hundreds and hundreds of dollars.","LG has struggled over the past few years to define the value proposition for its phones. Is it the rear-mounted home button? Is it the company’s Android skin with extras like Knock Code for unlocking your phone? Is it the historically great camera? It may well be all three and more, but LG has always lacked that intangible sense of polish and refinement you find in phones from Apple and Samsung.","The G5 carries on this problematic tradition.

Its 8MP sensor is as large as the competitions’, so selfies are crisp and look decent in moderate light.

The wide-angle lens has noticeable fisheye distortion around the edges and probably won’t do for cityscape photos, but it’s great for capturing broad landscape shots.

Some of LG’s additions are fun, letting you do things with the G5 like unlock it with a tapped-out Knock Code or take selfies by closing your fist. Others are just there to be different; almost all custom Android skins change at least a few of the default app icons.","Where stock Android is highly optimized to take advantage of every ounce of processing power, manufacturers have to do their own optimizations on their overlays. HTC and Samsung managed to do this well; LG, it seems, bobbled the ball. Transitions between app screens can stutter every so often, and many of the built-in apps take up valuable processor time.","Again, the LG G5 isn’t a slow phone – far from it.
