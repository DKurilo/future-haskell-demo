The original review is below, but check out our current top <a href=\"/best-photo-editing-software\">Photo Retouching Software</a> here.</em>","If you want to touch up your photos for your social media page or need to improve the glamour of your portrait models, photo retouching software is just the thing you need to get professional results. Akvis MakeUp is affordable photo retouching software that gives you the tools you need to enhance the natural beauty of your models without turning them into plastic dolls.","This photo enhancer has two modes of retouching. The first mode is Express mode, which is a simplified user interface that is perfect for a quick photo fix. This mode is great for busy photographers or casual user who just want to learn the basics of this software. Every feature is still available for use when you are in Express mode, they are just hidden to help minimize on-screen clutter. This photo fix program has over 36 preset adjustments and 17 customization settings to apply to your photos.","Advanced mode has all tools and settings available in their respective menus. This mode allows you to fine-tune your retouches like a professional. Ironically, this software does not have any ability to add cosmetic enhancements to your photos. Instead, this photo enhancer does allow you to adjust the contrast and color of your model&#39;s original makeup, making it pop more. There are tools to brighten teeth and remove spots and blemishes, as well as vignettes and other photo editing effects you can make to the whole picture.","Akvis MakeUp uses auto detection to determine where a subject’s face is in the picture and complete its edits. While it does detect facial proximity, the program does not single out eyes, lips or other facial features or place points to mask these areas. You can still perform skin smoothing, eye brightening and spot removal; you just have to do this by hand.","This software is ideal for single model, up-close portraits, not family photos or other group shots. The overall enhancements can’t be applied to just one part of the image; it blankets everything. You have to go in later with the history brush to remove the effect from unwanted areas.","This retouching software has a batch-processing feature that allows the user to edit hundreds of pictures at a time. Simply edit one photo from a large batch, save the changes as a preset and then apply that preset to an entire folder of images. In a matter of minutes, you’ve touched up an entire photo shoot.","This software can be purchased as a plugin for Adobe Photoshop or as a stand-alone program. Akvis also offers bundles with both versions. Not only are the programs sold separately, but they come in different licensing versions as well. There are home, academic and business license versions so you should be sure to get the right version that matches your needs.","This photo retouching software does a good job guiding users through its features. There is an online user manual and 13 text-and-picture tutorials that walk you through popular enhancement processes. A FAQ page is also available to learn from past user questions. Akvis does not have a built-in chat function, but they do provide their contact name for popular instant messenger programs such as ICQ, Yahoo, MSN Live Messenger and Google Talk. Akvis doesn’t offer a phone number for support, so an email or instant message might be your best option. The developer does provide support in multiple languages, including English, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian and Japanese."]},"id":"3692e1e6-264f-4dfe-8170-f3e50ef1cdb5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0ac5725e-fbf8-4b03-a0e6-21f44ccac64c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Akvis MakeUp&#39;s batch processing can make this photo retouching software a tempting choice when you have hundreds of portraits to retouch.
