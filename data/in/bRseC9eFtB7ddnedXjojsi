Smaller-sized kitchen TVs can fit on your countertop and allow you to keep up on your favorite shows when cooking, eating or even cleaning. These types of compact televisions can also be used in your bedroom, bathroom, office, RV or dorm room -- anywhere space is limited.","In our feature checklist, you&#39;ll find side-by-side comparisons of kitchen TVs that offer high-quality images and audio. In addition, there are also detailed reviews of each product as well as <a href=\"/electronics\">articles relating to televisions for the kitchen</a>. Using these resources will help you decide which television is best for you.","<strong>Kitchen TV Rating Criteria</strong>","Whether on the countertop or mounted on a wall, these small LCD kitchen TVs should be held to the same standards as the larger models. After all, just because you&#39;re choosing a smaller TV doesn&#39;t mean that you have to sacrifice picture or sound quality. As we reviewed each one of these products, we ranked them according to the following criteria:","<strong>Features</strong><br/>There is more to a television than it&#39;s screen size (though that is important). In this section we made sure each kitchen TV was built well and is easy to control. Viewing options, such as a built-in DVD player, are important for those who are using the TV in an area with poor reception. A good kitchen TV must also be compact in size and as lightweight as possible.","<strong>Display</strong><br/>If you can&#39;t see what is on the screen, then there is no point of having a TV in your kitchen. An adjustable aspect ratio will ensure you&#39;re getting the whole picture, while the brightness, resolution and contrast ratio make sure you get a sharp image and can see all the details. Horizontal and vertical viewing angles were also taken into account, as you may not be directly facing these TVs while you&#39;re watching them.","<strong>Connections</strong><br/>We live in a world of multimedia and a TV needs to be able to connect to more than just a power source. HDMI connections become more important daily as many television channels are quickly switching to HD. Standard RCA connections are also important to hook up some DVD players and gaming consoles. In addition, we checked to see if these televisions were also compatible with S-video, VGA, coaxial connections, USB drives, SD cards and headphones.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>Even though they are small and simple to use, these countertop TVs may have some issues. Whether the picture isn&#39;t coming in right or you don&#39;t know how to connect your Blu-ray player, customer support should be there to help you figure things out. If you just want a quick answer, we wanted to make sure options like a FAQs page or an online manual are available.","After reviewing each product based on the above criteria, we found the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">Coby TFDVD1595</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">ViewSonic N1630w </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">Toshiba 15LV505</a> to be the best kitchen TV options on the market today. Each one of these televisions offers great sound, superior picture quality and a variety of connectivity options. Plus, because of the compact design of these models, you won&#39;t take up valuable space in a confined area."]},"id":"595aa16f-6987-4060-abd3-3de015e505aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"05230619-f754-4a9b-8acb-9d5bb0033675","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003820PYI/?&tag=ttr_kitchen_tv1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|592[art|NA[pid|50337[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Coby TFDVD1595</a>","<a href=\"http://www.tacp.toshttps://recreationnation.me/main/content/toshiba-15-lcddvdhiba.com/dvd/product.asp?model=15lv505\">Toshiba 15LV505</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FH7GAS/?&tag=ttr_kitchen_tv1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|592[art|NA[pid|50341[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">SuperSonic SC-1568D</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00369T01W/?&tag=ttr_kitchen_tv1-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|592[art|NA[pid|50340[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Coby TFTV1525</a>","<a href=\"http://www.viore.com/PLC10V49.htm\">Viore PLC10V49</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"f287c8e8-4bf9-4c46-8234-d9812f926d1c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_592","url":"/best-kitchen-tvs","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-knoder","url":"/author/jonathan-knoder","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jonathan Knoder","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"yRHneGGUztMrGu99zxra6M","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-06T14:55:30Z","datePublished":"2011-09-13T22:10:12Z","name":"Kitchen TV Review","synopsis":"These 10-inch to 16-inch LCD televisions can fit on your countertop, under your cabinet or on your desk.
