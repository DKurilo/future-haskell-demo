On the downside, credit card processing is an extremely complex and nuanced process. On the plus side, there is plenty of help and many available options to get you started. First and foremost, you ll probably want to learn all about credit card processing machines, because depending on your business and the manner in which you run it, different machines can handle different scenarios in ways that are either better or worse than your competition. If you plan to run a fiscally sound and responsible business, it s a good idea to know what is out there and how it applies to your situation. For your convenience, you will find a list of several different types of credit card processing machines and specific details about them below.","<strong>Dial Up Terminal</strong>","The grandfather of credit card processing machines, dial-up terminals are still what the majority of retail locations use as their go-to system. As the name says, dial-up terminals use a phone line to connect you with a credit card processing company. The main advantage of this type of credit card processing machine is that they are normally inexpensive, comparatively, and they tend to be less complex than some higher-end options. The disadvantages lie in their much slower processor speeds, which means that these types of credit card machines generally can take anywhere from three to ten times as long to process a transaction as other options. Of course, you are talking a difference of seconds, but that time can add up quickly.","<strong>IP Terminal</strong>","A 21st-century upgrade to the dial-up terminal, IP terminals connect you, the merchant, to a credit card processing company over a high-speed internet connection. The main advantage that this type of machine has over a dial-up machine is speed. IP terminals can process transactions in about 3 seconds as opposed the 10 to 25 seconds that a dedicated dial-up machine might take. It also helps that IP terminals now cost about the same as dial-up units and that a single DSL link can accommodate more than one credit card processing machine.","<strong>Wireless Machines</strong>","The priciest yet most convenient type of credit card processing machine is a wireless unit that runs on a wireless network, much like your cell phone. These machines are widely used in businesses that require vendors to be out and among  customers.","<strong>Virtual Terminal</strong>","A credit card processing machine in a different vein, virtual terminals are simply computers running credit card processing software while being connected to a credit card reader. Virtual terminals are a great addition to an office that needs to eliminate space because they don t require a standalone credit card processing machine in order to get the job done.","As you can see, there are many options available for your business, and there s no single right answer. So whether you re on the go, stuck in a store, need extra space or have to get it done quickly, there s a credit card processing machine out there that will fit your business like a glove."]},"id":"1abd4d0f-f7cc-4343-83b1-7b896d67872b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5574","url":"/credit-card-processing-machines-all-you-need-to-know","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-poole","url":"/author/jonathan-poole","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jonathan Poole","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"y7WapaZTtRrsUwd8C9BWZ3","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-03-10T23:08:27Z","datePublished":"2011-03-10T23:08:27Z","name":"Credit Card Processing Machines: All You Need to Know","synopsis":"In this day and age, if you’re planning to start a business, then credit card processing is a must.
