You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Oxygenics Evolution features advanced technologies to increase the water pressure, a large <a href=\"/best-handheld-showerheads\">rotating showerhead</a> and four different spray settings housed in a modern design. One of the most intriguing features of the Oxygenics Evolution showerhead is the pressure-increasing technology that amplifies your existing water pressure. With this feature, you get a strong water flow each time your turn the water on. The only issue with this technology is that if your home water pressure is extremely weak, you may not be able to tell a big difference in this showerhead compared to one without the technology.","Unlike most showerheads, the Oxygenics Evolution showerhead allows you to effortlessly switch back and forth between settings with just the push of a button. The showerhead also rotates a full 360 degrees, so you can customize the amount of coverage you receive. While the showerhead doesn&#39;t have as many spray settings as some of the more expensive showerheads, the Oxygenics fixture features the most basic functions to get the job done.","When showerheads get dirty and clogged with mineral buildup or corrosion, the flow of water is usually limited. You can even tell by looking at a showerhead when it is clogged because water will cease to flow from dirty openings. The Oxygenics Evolution showerhead is designed from an industrial-strength acetal resin that guards against chlorine and other mineral clogs. This keeps your water pressure strong and your shower functioning as intended.","The handle is curved and ensures complete control when you are using it in the hand-held mode. It comes with a long, flexible hose that allows you to use the shower for washing hair, as well as rinsing legs and other extremities. The only issue with the unit may be the thickness of the handle. While it is curved to fit in the hand easily, those with smaller hands may find the handle a bit large and cumbersome. Weighing in at only 12.8 ounces, the fixture is extremely lightweight, so even with the added thickness, it may still be easier to handle than some of the thinner units.","The Oxygenics Evolution hand-held showerhead is easy to use and comes with a variety of features that can place it above its competition. The rotating head offers excellent coverage regardless of how tall or small you are, and you can&#39;t beat the lifetime guarantee that promises the unit will never clog."]},"id":"63333103-c70d-4e84-b721-1ed481c6cc4c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62900","url":"/oxygenics-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-19T22:22:26Z","datePublished":"2015-02-19T22:22:26Z","name":"Oxygenics Evolution","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-19T22:22:26Z","id":"evtVPYgzT8wsp8MPhx4PVA","meta":{"title":"Oxygenics Evolution Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Oxygenics.
