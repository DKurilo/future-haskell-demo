This thermometer comes with two probes and two grill clips, along with a receiver and a transmitter that displays the temperature of your meat. You can monitor the grill even if you are as far as an impressive 300 feet away.","Since this BBQ thermometer supports dual probes, you can simultaneously monitor food and your grill&#39;s temperature. In our tests, we used the additional probe to measure the temperature of a second steak.","With this digital grill thermometer, you can set multiple alarms to sound when your grill or meat reaches a desired temperature. The Maverick ET-733 also has preset temperatures for beef, veal, lamb, pork, chicken and turkey. It even has additional settings for less-common meats like deer, elk, moose and rabbit, among others.","When we grilled four steaks to four different degrees of doneness, we found the thermometer to be both accurate and consistent. However, the thermometer wasn&#39;t easy to set up. You will want to read the instruction manual to learn how to navigate the wireless receiver&#39;s many menus before you start using it. Unfortunately, even setting alarms wasn&#39;t intuitive, which was not the case with many other thermometers we tested.","This thermometer&#39;s response time isn&#39;t as fast as other thermometers. In our tests, the probes had an average reading time of 24.5 seconds. Both probes are 7-inches long and are capable of reading temperatures ranging from 32 to 572 degrees Fahrenheit.","One feature missing from this thermometer is automatic-shutoff. Since you are juggling both a transmitter and a wireless receiver, it&#39;s easy to forget to turn them off after preparing your meal, so an auto-shutoff would be useful.","Another complaint is that accessing the battery compartment of the transmitter requires a tiny Phillips head screwdriver. If you don&#39;t have one and use a larger screwdriver, it is very easy to strip the screws, making it almost impossible to change the batteries.","Maverick includes a 90-day warranty with this digital thermometer set, which is shorter than the warranties offered by other companies. The company offers telephone and email support, and you also can check the FAQs page on its website if you run into any difficulties."]},"id":"e596052e-8c5b-44a6-91bd-11a40704225b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63809","url":"/maverick-et-733-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-30T16:53:04Z","datePublished":"2015-03-30T16:53:04Z","name":"Maverick ET-733","synopsis":"With the Maverick ET-733 digital grill thermometer, you can monitor your grill without even being behind it.
