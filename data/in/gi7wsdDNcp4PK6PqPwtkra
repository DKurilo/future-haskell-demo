You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Photo Collage Studio is straightforward <a href=\"/best-photo-collage-software\">photo collage software</a> application that will help you create a photo collage in no time. The interface is slightly confusing to operate at first, but after a few minutes, you’ll get the hang of it.","The only drawback to this collage maker is the lack of modern embellishments and backgrounds. There are tons of templates and backgrounds, and if you are into bubbly cartoon and clip-art images, you’ll be happy. But if you’re looking for images that look like actual scrapbook paper and embellishments, you’ll be disappointed.","This program is quite simple to use. An initial window will pop open asking whether you would like to create a collage from a template or create a blank collage. There is no auto-collage feature, so either way you’ll have to insert your images manually. It is the ideal photo collage software for those of us who like to customize everything in our projects.","Exporting is as simple as saving your project. Unlike competitors, Photo Collage Studio doesn’t save your projects with its own special file format. When you save the project, you select which file format you prefer: BMP, JPEG, PNG and TIF. You can also set the collage as your desktop wallpaper or print it on your home printer. Wondershare, the manufacturers of Photo Collage Studio, doesn&#39;t offer its own printing services.","Wondershare has excellent customer support; it is one of the only photo collage software companies to provide live chat support on its website. We contacted customer service via chat and resolved our issues in minutes. You&#39;ll also find FAQs, an online forum of users, a contact email address and online tutorials."]},"id":"22030385-4496-4c22-91e6-2e94580c12cb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"78f5f9c8-0155-4da5-a6e6-a06359b25ed9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Photo Collage Studio is the perfect photo collage software if you&#39;re looking to completely personalize your project.
