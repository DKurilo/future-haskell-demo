Because this is big focus, its performance and features are somewhat lacking; for example, it has a low fan speed and no additional USB ports.","Producing airflow of just 22 CFM, the CFS8800BLK&#39;s fans aren&#39;t the most powerful available. They can certainly cool your laptop, but they&#39;re not quite as effective as some of the higher-power fans on other pads we reviewed. Because they are so low power, the fans are the quietest in our review, so you can run them constantly at full power without creating annoying noise.","This laptop cooler doesn’t have additional USB ports, and because it requires one of your laptop&#39;s USB ports to run, you may find yourself running out of places to connect your peripherals.
