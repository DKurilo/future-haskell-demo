They come with other benefits too. Business credit cards often have rewards programs that appeal to the needs of business owners, and you can issue cards to employees to streamline business-expense processes.","Business credit cards are not the same thing as consumer credit cards.

However, you&#39;ll want to ask for and carefully look over the terms of service before agreeing to sign up for a new card. Here&#39;s what you need to consider:","<strong>Teaser, Introductory Rates</strong><br/>Don&#39;t get teased into an attractive introductory interest rate while the actual rate lurks in the wings to make an unannounced appearance. Check the terms and conditions of service to see what your rate will be and if it will change after a certain time period. Another item to watch for is whether the rate is fixed or variable. A varying rate can skyrocket, leaving you paying much more interest than you planned, especially if you plan to carry a balance.","<strong>Late &amp; Over-Limit Fees</strong><br/>When reviewing the terms of service, take a look at what your late fees and over-limit fee may be. Late fees fluctuate depending on the card. Some cards don&#39;t have an over-limit fee, which can be good for those times in your business cycle when spending is high or if you lose track of your balance and overspend.","<strong>Foreign Transaction Fees</strong><br/>If you travel a lot, see if there is a fee for using your card overseas. Foreign transaction fees can add up when you are abroad and leave you with an unpleasant surprise on your statement.","The Truth in Lending Act and the Credit CARD Act of 2009 does not apply to business credit cards. That means issuers can legally charge you late fees. It is also well within their right to raise the interest rate on previously accumulated balances."]},"id":"b2fbcccd-5eb4-4937-ad9a-676dbe7ae035","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features to Look For"},"id":"aede385d-9605-456c-a328-c176418230aa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Choosing Your Benefits</strong>","Some banks reward your use of their card by giving you points that you can redeem for goods, airline miles, services or cash. Select business credit cards also offer statement credits as a reward.","If the card doesn&#39;t come at too high a price in terms of annual fees or high interest rates, you might be attracted to benefits that can include auto rental, baggage loss-and-damage insurance, or purchase protection in case of loss, fire, theft, damages, or price depreciation. Some providers offer advanced benefits such as access to exclusive events, hotel amenities and air travel upgrades.","When choosing a card for its benefits, be sure to take a look at the limitations. While the benefits may look good on the surface, limitations may render them nearly useless in reality. For example, some benefits may expire after a certain time while other card issuers require that you use the card for a certain period of time before you&#39;re eligible to use the rewards. Some cards also have rules about what types of purchases count toward points or cash-back rewards. Others have caps on how many points or rewards you can accrue in a certain amount of time.","<strong>Customer Service Options</strong>","When you have a question or an unexpected emergency (your card is stolen), being able to reach the credit card company quickly is paramount. You should have online access to manage your account.","In addition, you want to be sure you can quickly reach a customer service representative over the phone. Also check to see whether the company offers online live chat. This can be helpful when you don&#39;t want to wait on hold or you have a quick question.","Company credit cards are a convenient way to separate your personal finances from your business finances. This move will also help you each April when you prepare your tax returns. Your CPA will thank you for separating out your personal and business finances.","The benefits and rewards associated with business credit cards are intended to be helpful for business owners. However, the legal protections afforded by the Truth in Lending Act and the Credit CARD Act of 2009 do not apply to corporate credit cards.
