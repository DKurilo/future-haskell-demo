It also has the second highest sign-up offer in our review, giving you 40,000 bonus miles if you use the card to spend $3,000 within the first three months of having it. Another useful benefit is the 24/7 access to concierge service that it provides you with, which can be useful if you enjoy receiving restaurant and entertainment recommendations when you travel.
