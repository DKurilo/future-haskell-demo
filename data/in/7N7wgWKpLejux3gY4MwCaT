According to TSYS&#39;s 2015 Consumer Payment Choice Study, consumers largely prefer using credit and debit cards for the majority of their purchases, both in-store and online; only coffee shop and fast-food restaurant patrons prefer cash.","However, when your business pays between two to five percent in credit card fees for each transaction, it might not seem like great news. It&#39;s tempting to want to pass processing costs on to the customers that pay with cards – after all, cash is still a viable payment option.","The first step as a merchant is finding the <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">best credit card processor</a> for you. Then, if you choose to charge your customers convenience fees for paying with cards, there are factors that you need to consider:"]},"id":"e03714d6-da28-443d-933f-8934a2541de7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Is Charging a Credit Card Convenience Fee Legal?"},"id":"cba3e35e-d95a-4744-9112-b900d12e7cf7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Charging customers credit card convenience fees is legal in all but 10 states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma and Texas. California is a special case, because at the time of this writing, the civil code forbidding surcharges is under dispute.","However, even if charging convenience fees is legal in your state, there are regulations you need to comply with. Each credit card network has its own rules for when and how you can charge a convenience fee on credit card purchases. Here are some of requirements they hold in common:","•\tYou must notify the credit card company 30 days in advance of enacting convenience fees.<br/>•\tFees can only apply to credit card purchases.<br/>•\tYou cannot charge a convenience fee for debit cards or prepaid cards.<br/>•\tFees cannot exceed the processing fee you pay your credit card processor, or 4 percent, whichever is smaller.<br/>•\tYou must post signs at the entrance of your store and at the checkout clearly stating that you charge a convenience fee and how much your customer will pay. <br/>•\tConvenience fees must be clearly marked on the receipt.<br/>•\tIf you refund a customer his or her money, the return should include the convenience fee as well.","There are other card-specific regulations. For example, Visa mandates that you cannot require a customer to spend more than $10 in order to use a card to pay for his or her purchase. Additionally, all of the card networks have rules for when more than one type of card is accepted at an establishment. Most commonly, the card networks limit the dollar amount you can charge a customer for a convenience fee."]},"id":"ac888c75-3a08-4966-9a99-95f834b68952","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"<strong>Convenience Fee or Cash Discount?</strong>"},"id":"b32dd030-d678-4d1f-be7b-df4a6dc8a9dd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Charging convenience fees is a double-edged sword. With the exception of cases where accepting credit and debit cards is a real convenience – such as when the only alternative is using a money order – using plastic to pay is no longer considered a convenience but a common practice. Thus, charging a convenience fee may alienate potential customers and send them elsewhere.","Most merchants fold their processing costs into the prices they charge for their products, which means higher prices for everyone. Although charging a convenience fee for credit card users may let you offer lower prices to your cash customers, a better alternative, that&#39;s legal in all states, is to simply offer your customers a discount for using cash. This policy encourages your customers to use cash and allows you to avoid the appearance of penalizing customers that pay with plastic.","Credit card payments, and credit card processing fees, are a fact of business. In most states, you can pass processing costs on to the customer through credit card convenience fees, but in many cases, it might not be the best move for your business. There are strict requirements to follow, and the extra charge may turn off customers. Before enacting this policy, be sure to check the rules of the credit cards you accept and consider if a discount for cash might be a more favorable option.","<em>Contributing Reviewer: Karina Fabian</em>"]},"id":"9069815b-552a-4063-a4fa-2743e9bb5d62","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10128","url":"/charge-credit-card-fees","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"lori-fairbanks","url":"/author/lori-fairbanks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Lori Fairbanks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"p6N3q9MSBBLsV6BQ4Qpsyc","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-06T19:51:39Z","datePublished":"2016-10-06T19:51:39Z","name":"Should You Charge Your Customers Credit Card Convenience Fees?","synopsis":"Paying with plastic is increasingly the default option for most Americans.","review":{},"strapline":"Paying with plastic is increasingly the default option for most Americans.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-06T21:06:17Z","id":"7N7wgWKpLejux3gY4MwCaT","meta":{"title":"Should You Charge Your Customers Credit Card Convenience Fees?","description":"While it&#039;s tempting to pass credit card processing costs to customers that pay with cards, you need to make sure doing so is legal in your state.
