This waffle maker cuts your overall meal preparation time by making two waffles at a once. With its 1400-watt output, you’re as little as 2.5 minutes from having waffles. This is very helpful if you’re cooking for the whole family, as you’ll be turning out a fresh waffle every 75 seconds.","This waffle iron features a deep 1-inch waffle pattern and an overflow channel to help reduce spills. There are mechanical thermometers on both sides of the KitchenAid Waffle Baker that display a temperature range of Cool, Preheating and Ready rather than an indicator light. While this dial thermometer does provide a distinct aesthetic appeal, it serves the same function as an LED indicator.","The KitchenAid Waffle Baker features a timer that helps you control how long your waffle is cooked. The timer adjustment dial and display show your set cooking time, and that will stay in the appliances memory even after you’ve unplugged it. A built-in Overbake feature counts up the seconds from zero after the timer alarm has sounded to make it easier for you to modify the set cooking time with the next batch.","With the Waffle Baker user manual KitchenAid provides a decent set of waffle recipes but only basic recipes. Overall with the heavy-duty KitchenAid design and generous capacity of the waffle irons, the Waffle Baker is a good appliance for working the more complex Belgian and Liege waffle recipes as well."]},"id":"1b93270e-7c01-440c-b439-30ac2494e38d","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/WQD3mwh7XLnnQGHwgmdmqD.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"If you use low-fat waffle recipes, KitchenAid recommends that you add extra butter or oil as they tend to stick to the Teflon surface.

KitchenAid is so confident in its product that the company will ship you a replacement unit should your waffle maker fail inside the warranty period.","The KitchenAid Waffle Baker lives up to the KitchenAid name.
