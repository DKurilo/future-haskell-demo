It is available in 15 sizes. With its round shape, this solar pool cover from Leslie&#39;s Swimming Pool Supplies is ideal for curved and irregularly-shaped pools. Its material is a low-density material made from polyethylene resins. Although it has a low density, the pool cover is a heavy-duty cover with reinforced seams. This and its wide dimension make the solar blanket stay flat when spread on a pool.","The blanket has a thickness of 13 mils and is, therefore, one of the thicker pool covers available. A thick pool cover has its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it improves the ability to trap heat and warm a pool. On the other hand, the blanket is heavy and, therefore, requires at least two people and a reel to stow away and deploy. The thick fabric also makes the solar pool cover durable enough for Leslie&#39;s to cover it with a seven-year warranty. If youâ€™re in the market for a thinner, somewhat more affordable blanket the <a href=\"/best-solar-pool-covers\">SolarCovers.com Standard Blue</a> is a good option.","The solar blanket has air bubbles on its underside. The air pockets inside these bubbles diffuse sunlight and spread its warmth across the pool. The bubbles also serve as an insulation layer that prevents cooler air from drawing heat from the pool. In addition to those bubbles, the solar cover also benefits from THERMO-TEX technology, which helps to trap thermal heat in a pool better than a typical solar blanket.","Another benefit of the THERMO-TEX technology is enhanced durability, so the blanket can resist heat damage from prolonged sun exposure longer than a regular pool cover. However, the solar pool cover does not have a UV-resistant film. This means that while the THERMO-TEX layer makes it heat resistant, the solar blanket is still susceptible to UV damage. In order to keep the integrity of the bubbles and THERMO-TEX layer of the pool cover, you should make sure you do not leave it out in the sun on hot days and keep it covered when in storage.","With its air bubbles and clear, transparent THERMO-TEX material, the Leslie&#39;s 7-Year Round Solar Blanket with THERMO-TEX has the features required to deliver on Leslie&#39;s promise of reducing water evaporation from your pool by 95 percent and cutting the cost of heating the pool by 70 percent. However, the pool blanket lacks a UV-resistant film."]},"id":"9f7a2338-472e-4f8f-85e8-79d06d604833","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63265","url":"/leslies-7-year-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T20:06:56Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T20:06:56Z","name":"Leslie's 7-Year Round","synopsis":"The Leslie's 7-Year Round Solar Blanket with THERMO-TEX is a clear solar cover for in-ground and indoor swimming pools.
