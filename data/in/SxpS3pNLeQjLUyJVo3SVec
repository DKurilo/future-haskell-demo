The 3Doodler Start 3D Printing Pen is a safe and easy way for your child to experience creativity in a whole new way. Rather than being limited to pencils and paint on paper, your child can design and build three-dimensional items that stand up, roll and spin. The 3Doodler Start is recommended for ages 8 and up, but it’s also a good starting point for anyone wanting to explore 3D drawing at an affordable price point this <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lists/gift-ideas\">holiday season</a>.","You may be wondering how a pen that melts plastic could be safe for kids, but the 3Doodler Start Pen is designed to work with low heat. The plastic has a low melting point and is specially made for this particular pen. It’s still flexible but cools so quickly that you can manipulate the plastic with your fingers before it hardens should you want to play with the shapes.","The rechargeable, wireless pen has an on and off switch and only needs about a minute to warm up, similar to a glue gun, and has an LED light that indicates when it is ready for use. To start drawing, you just put in a strand of the proprietary Eco-Plastic and push the big yellow button.","The 3Doodler Start Essentials Kit comes with 48 strands of Eco-Plastic in eight different colors. You can buy additional strands on the company’s website and through a few major retailers. The plastic strands are non-toxic and food-safe, but they’re also biodegradable and will start to break down after 45 days if they’re in contact with soil.","Keep in mind that the 3Doodler Start can’t use the same materials that most 3D printers use, such as PLA or ABS plastic. You should also be aware that the plastic this pen uses is not compatible with the other pens in the 3Doodler line. The 3Doodler Start can only work with the plastic the company offers specifically for this pen.","The Essentials Kit also includes a Project book that contains several different stencils and project ideas to get your child started. Once you’ve exhausted the resources in the booklet, you can head online to the Community page on the website for even more free stencils and guides, as well as other kits you can purchase. The company also has a YouTube channel and a Facebook page where you can search for new ideas.","The 3Doodler Start allows your budding artist to begin thinking and creating in 3D. The rechargeable pen warms up quickly and never gets too hot to handle. Even the non-toxic plastic cools quickly, so children can easily create their own toys and new inventions."]},"id":"a461a1ed-236d-4177-ad9d-1cf62c5d3058","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68713","url":"/3doodler-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-04T17:04:31Z","datePublished":"2016-11-04T17:04:31Z","name":"3Doodler Start 3D Printing Pen","synopsis":"Do you have a budding artist that would like to take art into the third dimension?
