You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","When you’re looking for a <a href=\"/best-wall-air-conditioners\">wall air conditioner</a>, a variety of factors come into play. If you have several specific needs, you’ll probably want a higher-end model that has more to offer. Enter the Frigidaire FRA12EHT2 wall-mounted air conditioner, which has nearly anything you could want in a wall air conditioner—and then some.","With three fan speeds, a 12,000/11,700 BTU cooling performance and quick-cooling power, your room will be the perfect temperature in next to no time. And this goes for cooler months, too; this in-wall air conditioner has a supplemental heating function to keep you toasty. If humid summers are common in your area, you’ll be kept comfy thanks to this unit’s 3.5-pints-per-hour dehumidifying ability.","This through-the-wall air conditioner is capable of cooling, heating and dehumidifying a space of up to 640 square feet, which translates to a room size of roughly 25 feet square. The unit has an energy efficiency ratio of 9.0 and has an energy saver option, but it unfortunately is not Energy Star certified. In addition to the energy saver option, two functions help you save on your energy bill: sleep mode and a 24-hour timer. The sleep mode gradually cools less by a few degrees over the evening, while the timer lets you program what time your unit turns on and off in half-hour increments, so you never have to come home to a sweltering room.","The bacterial mesh air filter keeps your air circulation clean and free of bacteria, odors and other airborne debris. To make your life a little easier, the air filter alert tells you when to change the filter for optimal performance. Another handy feature is the remote control, which has a built-in thermostat to help you maintain your preset room settings. And if you lose power for any reason, this wall AC unit will automatically restart at previous settings when power is restored.","For DIY-ers, a variety of general, wiring and installation guides are available. A link on the manufacturer’s product page takes you to unit-specific product help, which includes links to the aforementioned manuals, a list of FAQs and a 1-800 number and email address for customer support. An “Owner Center” section of the website has more generic help options, including more FAQs, product registration, a “find service and parts” tool and extended warranty options to supplement the included one-year warranty."]},"id":"b22c4a67-0e0e-49ad-9e0c-7f4f1afd0497","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58548","url":"/frigidaire-fra-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-04T21:50:47Z","datePublished":"2014-01-04T21:50:47Z","name":"Frigidaire FRA12EHT2","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-01-04T21:50:47Z","id":"zrnYSRC4itprDzFbCURe2i","meta":{"title":"Frigidaire FRA12EHT2 Review 2017 | Best In Wall AC","description":"Compare wall air conditioners to find the right unit for your home, like the Frigidaire FRA12EHT2.
