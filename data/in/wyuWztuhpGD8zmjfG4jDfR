Random Access Memory, or RAM, allows you to run multiple applications simultaneously. The Gateway SX2865 has 4GB of memory and the capacity for 8GB. 4GB is plenty to run day-to-day programs, and 8GB will satisfy virtually any need apart from heavily intensive video rendering or 3D design. The storage capacity is 1TB – enough to store about 1,000 hours of digital video. The processor is an Intel Pentium G640 with a speed of 2.8 GHz, which is decent but could be better.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/53822-gateway-sx285511.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfNQwnPqXHJAdvLxoUSn7G.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"PfNQwnPqXHJAdvLxoUSn7G","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfNQwnPqXHJAdvLxoUSn7G.jpg","alt":""},"id":"17c8205e-8dfa-4e8c-895c-e74dd767baa7","type":"image"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"ed1bbf1c-2206-46dd-9220-4e289b15c2b5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The features included with the Gateway SX2865 desktop computer are comprehensive.
