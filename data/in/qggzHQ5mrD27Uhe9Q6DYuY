The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/beauty/best-electric-razors/\">Electric Razors</a> here.</em>","The Remington FR-750 comes packed with many features. Some of those features have become standard requirements for electric razors, but some of them set the FR-750 a bit apart from other electric razors. The best electric shaver will have a long the battery life and won&#39;t require an inordinate amount of time to recharge the battery. If your electric razor ran out of juice halfway through a shave, you probably wouldn&#39;t be very happy. If you choose not to rely on the battery, plug in the FR-750 for another option. The triple-bladed foil head gets close enough to your skin to give you a smooth shave.","With a battery life of 30 minutes, you probably won&#39;t have to worry about the FR-750 not completing a shave. However, if you spend a significant amount of time touching up and styling your facial hair, then you may want to consider keeping the razor plugged in. After the battery is depleted, you should allow 60 minutes for it to recharge. Shaving once a day will leave you with plenty of time in between charging sessions.","This electric razor will take care of you as long as you take care of it. Cleaning and maintenance on the FR-750 is quick and painless. The head of the razor pops off, which enables you to clean the razor under a faucet quite easily. If the head and cutters wear out, then you can purchase a replacement set to increase the life of the device. You can expect the FR-750 to last for several years.","A mobile head and solid overall design help ensure that your face will receive an excellent shave. The FR-750&#39;s full-flex pivoting neck provides the device with a wide range of movement. This allows the head of the razor to partially adjust itself to the contours of your face. As the head moves over your face, the hair moves into the holes on the head and is sheared off by the cutters. The triple-bladed head ensures that one stroke will cut most, if not all, of the facial hair in its path down to size."]},"id":"bdc4055d-f619-46d2-8a52-78efb58e18d1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58056","url":"/remington-fr-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T20:03:03Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T20:03:03Z","name":"Remington FR-750","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":23,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-10-30T20:03:03Z","id":"qggzHQ5mrD27Uhe9Q6DYuY","meta":{"title":"Remington FR-750 Electric Razor Review - Pros and Cons","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
