Sometimes you just need a jump-starter that has enough power to turn the engine over. That&#39;s what you&#39;ll find here. What you won&#39;t find is a host of emergency tools and features â€“ the Booster PAC is rather limited in that regard.","Even though its secondary features are limited, the Booster PAC is a very capable jump-starter. With 1,500 peak amps, it has enough power to turn most engines over. That&#39;s the second-highest peak amp rate on our lineup.","This car battery charger has rather long jumper cables. The 43-inch cables are stored on the charger itself, fitting snugly inside grooves. The clamps are stored on hooks on the sides of the unit. The ES5000 weighs in at 18 pounds and has a built-in handle, making life easier for those who have to carry this battery charger around. It measures 4.4 inches tall, 18 inches long and 8 inches wide, so you can stow this battery jump-starter under a seat or in a trunk or storage compartment with ease.","Unfortunately, the Clore Booster PAC does not have a reverse polarity warning feature. This means that you could potentially ruin a battery if you place the clamps on the wrong posts. Be sure to take your time and connect the cables correctly with this charger.","Should you need to recharge any electric devices while waiting for rescue on the side of the road, the Booster PAC has one DC power port. It doesn&#39;t have any USB ports for smartphones or tablets, though you can get adapters for those. The built-in battery tester can be very useful, especially if you have an older vehicle, as it shows you when your battery is close to dying. That&#39;s about it for emergency tools on this battery booster.","You won&#39;t find an LED flashlight or tire air compressor on the Booster PAC. The lack of these features doesn&#39;t detract from the device as a battery charger, but it certainly loses some versatility for different emergencies. The one-year warranty isn&#39;t fantastic, but it&#39;s still a good amount of time for you to notice any factory defects and return the product for replacement."]},"id":"37e80af0-3a5c-4cea-8cfa-d6608cd7f3a2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"df05afeb-13ab-4982-9367-aaa48dde2416","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Clore Booster Pac ES5000 can easily give any 12-volt battery a good jolt, but it leaves something to be desired in terms of safety and emergency features.
