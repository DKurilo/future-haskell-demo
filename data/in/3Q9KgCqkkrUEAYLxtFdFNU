This is important because a decrease of just 3dB SPL requires double the amplifier power to achieve the same output. Amplifiers produce much cleaner, more precise sound when they&#39;re not being challenged so much.","It doesn&#39;t take much power to drive these bookshelf speakers. You can use them with as little as 10 watts of power. On the other hand, they can handle a pretty impressive 150 watts maximum input.
