You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Tabcat Cat Tracker uses radio tracking, instead of GPS, and is a combination of traditional radio frequency and up-to-date technologies. It receives and transmits radio signals on the 2.45 GHz frequency band.","The homing tag is ideal for cats as it only weighs 0.175 ounces, even less than the <a href=\"/safepet4me-review\">SafePet4Me</a> tag. The Tabcat&#39;s slimline handset is about the size of a credit card. The tag comes with a splashproof case, which can be used to attach the tag to your cat&#39;s collar. The range of <a href=\"/best-pet-tracking-devices\">pet tracker</a> is up to 400 feet with one-inch accuracy.","Although this pet tracking device has no map or boundary alerts, it can send radio signals through doors and walls; however, these type of obstructions decrease the range. When you track your cat, the handset displays blinking lights to show how far away you are from each other: green for close, amber for a little further away and red for far away. It also guides you down and up as well as right or left. In addition, when you&#39;re tracking, both the handset and the homing tag beep; the closer you are, the faster the beeps sound. Because the homing tag beeps when you switch the handset on, it can also be used as a training device. As soon as your cat appears once the beep has sounded, give her a treat; she&#39;ll soon come whenever the beep activates.","The included batteries last for up to five months because you only power up the handset when you want to track your cat with the pet tracking device. The batteries are replaceable and are available for sale from Tabcat. The kit comes with a magnetic mount, so you can store your handset on the fridge or in another suitable position, which means it’s easy to find every time you want to use it.","The pet tracking kit comes with two homing tags, and you can purchase two more if you have four cats since the handset is capable of tracking up to four cats. There is no activation fee or monthly subscription, so you only pay the initial purchase price of the kit.","If you&#39;re looking for a reasonably priced pet tracking device to use at home and in the immediate neighborhood, the Tabcat is a good option. The handset is simple to use, and unlike the slightly bulkier <a href=\"/trax-review\">Trax</a> or <a href=\"/petrack-review\">PeTrack</a>, the tag is small and comfortable for a cat to wear."]},"id":"b82a6bc7-cea6-4f8a-9fb3-7900b09d07d4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62785","url":"/loc8tor-pet-gps-for-cats-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-18T00:10:40Z","datePublished":"2015-02-18T00:10:40Z","name":"Tabcat Cat Tracker","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-18T00:10:40Z","id":"RXGBBssjsTc5v8LChGXoBM","meta":{"title":"Loc8tor Pet GPS for Cats Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Uncover all there is to know about the Loc8tor Pet for Cats, so you can find your kitty in your home or garden.
