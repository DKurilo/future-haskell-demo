You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Reliability is a big factor when it comes to buying a new <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TV</a>. Sony stands for quality and dependability, and its products always compete with the best. The R Series LED TVs are just another example of Sony&#39;s predictably strong performance. The R510A sports impressive picture quality for an entry-level TV.","The picture on the Sony R510A TV is quite impressive, especially for an entry-level TV. The superb video quality on this LED screen is thanks in part to excellent color detail like many other Sony TVs. The picture looks vibrant and pops off the screen. Having a great black level means dark and light colors will contrast nicely, lending scenes a level of depth and accuracy that many TVs can&#39;t match at the entry-level price point. TV shows and movies look more realistic and dynamic as well.","This TV also sports a 240Hz refresh rate. This spec is handy if you like to watch live sports, play video games and catch every detail of your favorite action flicks. The refresh rate allows for more frames, which is ideal for fast action scenes. TVs with slower refresh rates have motion-blur problems. Certain scenes, like fast-action sports, move too quickly for the TV to refresh. With the Sony R510A, you won&#39;t run into this problem with most fast-moving scenes. Since this is an entry-level TV, you won’t find features like voice control or 2D to 3D conversion.","You can buy a Sony R Series as big as 60 inches, or if you want a smaller TV for a guest room or master bedroom, you can choose a 32- or 40-inch size. All the Sony TVs feature a slim frame around the TV that is hardly noticeable. The TV doesn&#39;t look clunky.","Not only does this Sony have a great picture, but it comes jam-packed with many features that come with the best LED TVs. With the Sony R510A, you can go beyond the box and use the built-in Wi-Fi to connect to the web. You can connect to video-streaming apps like Netflix, YouTube and Hulu Plus. You can listen to music on Pandora or turn on NPR. You can check news stories from the Associated Press or HuffPost Live. The features on this smart TV allow you to stay connected with the world, all from the comfort of your couch or bedroom.","You can display HD content by connecting a Blu-ray player, video game system or cable or satellite box to your TV. It is likely you have multiple units to connect to your TV, so having a good number of HDMI ports and older connections like composite or component connections is essential for a home theater system. This Sony delivers with three HDMI ports, which is not as good as the best LED TVs but is still workable with most home theaters.","High-end LED TVs tend to be a little pricey. The cost is worth it, as long as the device is dependable. A company like Sony, which has a long, rich history of producing quality dependable electronics, offers peace of mind. If you do run into a problem, or have any questions about your TV, Sony offers top-notch customer support. You can contact Sony through the toll-free number, live chat operator or email. If you feel like researching online, Sony also has a FAQs page and downloadable manuals. Sony also includes a one-year manufacturer&#39;s warranty."]},"id":"36407685-e910-40ad-b581-254f48b606d2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"388cc471-d8ef-4310-a674-5dc9c117320b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The dependable Sony R Series has a strong competitor with the R510A.
