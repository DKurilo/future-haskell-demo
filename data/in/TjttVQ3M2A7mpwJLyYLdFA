The traffic information is made especially relevant because of the trafficTrends feature, which helps the 3760LMT learn traffic-flow trends based on the time of day. This means you will always have the most accurate estimated time of arrival based on the time of day and day of the week during which you are traveling.","Garmin units come with access to six million Points of Interest, and you can set aside up to 100 of your own. You can mark hotels, restaurants and stores of your choosing and have the 3760LMT give you directions to them from wherever you are at any given moment.","This is one of the Garmin products that lets you have a lot of choice in your final route.
