Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Google is back for round two with their <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> the Google Nexus S. This cell phone offers the Gingerbread operating system, Google applications and a 4-inch display. It is fast, can multitask and allows you to video chat. Even with these excellent features, there are some areas where this cellular device is lacking.","The 4-inch touchscreen is responsive and offers stunning picture on the Nexus S. The display features 480 x 800 pixel resolution, which is one of the highest resolutions you will find on a smartphone. The colors are vivid and bright, and images are crisp and detailed. Unfortunately, the touchscreen does have a little lag time after keys are pushed on the virtual keypad and while programs are opening.","Even with such a large display screen, the dimensions of the phone stay fairly small. The device is 4.8 inches long and 2.4 inches wide. This smartphone weighs 4.5 ounces, which is lightweight compared to many devices with similar design features.","The multimedia features available on the Google Nexus S are those you would find on most smartphones. There is a built-in MP3 player that lets you listen to music while you are on the go. A 3.5mm headphone jack is available on the device so you can plug in a pair of headphones and listen whenever you want.","There is a 5MP (megapixel) rear camera on the device. We were disappointed to see Google only settled for a 5MP camera instead of 8MP or higher. There is an autofocus feature, along with flash, so you can still take high-quality photos.","All of your basic call features are available on the Google Nexus S. These features include conference calling, call holding along with call waiting. You can view your call history and see your dialed, received and missed phone calls. You can also customize the contacts in your address book by assigning specific ringtones or pictures to their contact information.","This smartphone offers up to 402 talk-time minutes on a single battery charge. The battery drains quickly when any of the phone’s displays are active. If you are constantly texting, listening to music, playing games or making phone calls, your battery will not last long and you&#39;ll need to charge it frequently. Luckily, up to 428 standby hours are available on a single battery charge. This gives you days, even weeks, of power if you use it sparingly.","Gingerbread, also known as Android 2.3, is the operating system available on the Nexus S. Gingerbread gives the phone additional speed, a different file system for applications and an improved keyboard compared to the Android 2.2 system. Gingerbread also improves gaming and offers a variety of new games. We were disappointed to see that even with an improved operating system, this smartphone lacks 4G capabilities. The 4G technology is quickly becoming a must-have in several new cell phones, and without it this cell phone is quickly falling behind the competition."]},"id":"83db9d07-84c1-48d9-aaf7-945a21727f8b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3565fd54-a34f-4d4c-8627-26f7b296fbc8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Android 2.3 operating system and stunning design of the Google Nexus S are the standout features available on this smartphone.
