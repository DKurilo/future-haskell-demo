With that in mind, the <strong>LG LSC27921SW</strong> has a similar appearance and features to other LG <a href=\"/best-side-by-side-refrigerators\">side-by-side refrigerators</a>. One of the main ways this refrigerator is unique is the look of the ice dispenser. Instead of having one paddle that dispenses both water and ice or two side-by-side paddles that dispense either water or ice, the LG LSC27921SW has one large paddle-like button that dispenses cubed or crushed ice. Above that is another smaller button that dispenses water.","The water dispenser button is flush with the door of the refrigerator freezer, while the ice dispenser button is deeper, lying flat instead the indent created by the ice dispenser. This layered look gives the LG model a unique, modern design. Since many side-by-side refrigerators have the same features and layout, the appearance of a refrigerator and how it will complement the other appliances in your kitchen is definitely something to consider. If you like the overall look of the refrigerator with the unique ice maker, the LG may be the side-by-side refrigerator for you.","The digital control panel is arranged vertically on the left side of the dispenser, unlike traditional refrigerators that place the control panel horizontally above the ice dispenser. This design makes for a sleek appearance, although we did have one qualm about the layout. The child lock is located at the bottom of the column of controls, meaning it is the perfect height for children to reach, set and unset. We don&#39;t see the point of having a child lock that is not child-proof.","The LG unit has a total capacity of 26.4 cubic feet. It is an energy-efficient side-by-side refrigerator, and as such is ENERGY STAR compliant. Users will spend an estimated yearly sum of $63 to operate this appliance. That means you would pay $2.38 yearly for every cubic foot, which is lower than the average side-by-side refrigerator.","There are plenty of space and storage options in the LG. The three spill-proof shelves are adjustable, as are three of the four refrigerator door bins. The adjustable storage options allow users to customize their refrigerator for their needs, and if those needs change, they can readjust accordingly.","The storage options in this side-by-side refrigerator keeps all your food fresh longer. There are two humidity-controlled crispers in this refrigerator, while most models only have one. The humidity controls allow users to adjust the temperature to suit the foods they are currently storing in the crispers. The snack drawer, dairy corner, three freezer shelves, four freezer door bins and freezer drawer also help users keep their foods organized and easy to find.","The LoDecibel Quiet Operation keeps the LG refrigerator running quietly. This is an important feature as no one wants loud noises roaring in their kitchen day and night. Another helpful feature is the door alarm, which sounds if anyone has left the door open for too long.","Most warranties only last for one year. While the LG has a one-year warranty on parts and labor, it also has a seven-year warranty on the sealed system.","This side-by-side refrigerator comes in smooth white, smooth black, stainless steel and titanium."]},"id":"a72d90ae-eb8d-40e5-8318-272eb2c23452","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3f852bf5-cea3-41ad-9b87-ae6c549898fa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>LG LSC27921SW</strong> looks sophisticated and modern, while still sporting all the essential storage space, shelves, door bins and crispers to keep your food organized and fresh."]},"id":"73c28ee0-9a8b-43bd-a2ab-6d055a3fbf22","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51866","url":"/lg-lsc27921sw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-01-12T20:53:50Z","datePublished":"2011-01-12T20:53:50Z","name":"LG LSC27921SW","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.
