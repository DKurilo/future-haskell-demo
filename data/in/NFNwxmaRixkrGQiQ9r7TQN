The software features a clean, easy-to-use design and has some good customization and burning options. But of all the <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">Mac DVD copiers</a> we reviewed, it took the longest – 1.5 hours – to complete the copying process.","This application is pretty easy for beginners to use. There are two options for copying: Full Disc Mode and Movie-Only Mode. Full Disc Mode lets you burn your movies while leaving the menus and features intact.  If you only want the movie and don&#39;t want the menus and extraneous material, use the Movie-Only Mode. This option tells the program to find the file on the DVD with the longest run time and to only copy that file.","Xilisoft can burn to both types of blank DVDs: DVD-9 and DVD-5. If you want to make an exact copy of a commercial DVD, use a DVD-9 since they have enough space. If you use a DVD-5, the program will compress the video to fit onto these smaller discs, but you&#39;ll notice some quality loss in the video.","If you don&#39;t have a blank DVD, the program can rip the movie and its contents onto your hard drive as an ISO image file. Then it will store that image until you have a blank DVD handy, when you can use the ISO file to make a copy. You can also use this file as a virtual DVD that you can watch with compatible software,  which is easy to find on the internet.","This software&#39;s simplicity makes comprehensive help and support options an unnecessary luxury. However, you can find help though the in-program help menu or the support email address provided on Xilisoft&#39;s website. If the online tutorials  and in-program help menu fail you, then the email form will surely get you the answers you need. It would have been nicer to have more options, but given that this program is a snap to use, this omission isn&#39;t too troubling."]},"id":"a1bfa4ad-2c18-4294-aab9-fcfd22052375","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"362ebc23-3851-4b3c-8480-6294e126c296","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Xilisoft DVD Copy for Mac is an intuitive way to make personal copies of your DVD collection.
