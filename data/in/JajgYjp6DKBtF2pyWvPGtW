The 18-Volt ONE+ Laminate Trimmer router has a no-load speed of 29,000 RPMs and it&#39;s unique in that it is cordless and has a positional base that can be maneuvered freely, regardless if you are right or left-handed. This gives you unsurpassed freedom in your shop or with your outside projects.","The compact size of this Ryobi laminate trimmer gives you the exact control you need with your projects. In addition, it feels good in either hand. You can change the ¼” collet sized bits quickly by utilizing the oversized spindle lock. This does require a wrench to turn, but fortunately, the Ryobi Trim Router includes one. Adjusting the height securely and quickly is easy as well with the sturdy Cam lever clamp.","The Ryobi 18-Volt ONE+ Trim Router is great addition to your tool line-up, and has an attractive design. The combination of blue, black, silver and yellow make it a very nice-looking tool. The trimmer has a see-through laminate sub-base for easier visibility. This is extremely helpful, and helps eliminates guessing where your bit is while you trim. The package comes with the P600 trimmer, bit wrench and an operator’s manual. Ryobi offers a 30-day guarantee along with a 3-year warranty.","This trim router is part of Ryobi’s extensive ONE+ collection. This collection of over 50 tools uses the same kind of battery and charger, which means the 18-Volt ONE+ trimmer is interchangeable with the green or blue ONE+ collection batteries and chargers, as well. Unfortunately, this unit’s battery and charger are sold separately.","With interchangeable batteries, you can save time and money by sharing your ONE+ tools’ power sources. Ryobi also has multiple battery style options, and you can purchase a lithium-ion battery for your trimmer that makes it even lighter than its 2.3 pounds performs better than standard battery packs."]},"id":"6b23b59d-33d7-42e4-b310-ff5e5a9debc2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61662","url":"/ryobi-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-17T19:38:58Z","datePublished":"2014-12-17T19:38:58Z","name":"Ryobi 18-Volt ONE+ P600","synopsis":"If you constantly have multiple projects, you need a handheld router that can trim quickly and with precision.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"If you constantly have multiple projects, you need a handheld router that can trim quickly and with precision.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-12-17T19:38:58Z","id":"JajgYjp6DKBtF2pyWvPGtW","meta":{"title":"Ryobi 18-Volt ONE+ P600 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Ryobi 18-Volt ONE+.
