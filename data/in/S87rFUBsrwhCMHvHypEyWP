The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 </em><a href=\"/best-baby-video-monitors\"><em>Baby Video Monitors</em></a><em> here.</em>","Not all video baby monitors are alike. While the Angelcare AC1120 doesn&#39;t have all of the features we look for in our baby video monitor reviews, it makes up for those drawbacks with some unique and incredibly helpful features. This isn&#39;t the best video baby monitor available, but there are some good reasons to consider it.","The Angelcare AC1120 has an impressive maximum transmission range at 650 feet. That will allow you to roam around your house in comfort. The 2.8-inch screen size also is somewhat small compared to other video baby monitors. We were most disappointed to see that the system doesn’t have a multi-camera expandability option, so you have to buy two sets and carry two monitors if you want to check on more than one room. Likewise, a lack of Skype and video recording functions means you have to be within the 650-foot range to use the system. We did admire the pan, tilt and zoom controls, as well as the infrared night vision.","The baby video monitor can operate in continuous mode, or you can switch to the VOX voice-activated monitoring mode. The two-way talk feature turns the unit into a walkie-talkie, allowing you to soothe your baby from the other side of the house. A signal indicator lets you know how strong the wireless signal is.","In addition to the signal indicator mentioned above, the AC1120 also has alerts to let you know when you’re about to go out of range, and when the battery is low. But perhaps the most impressive design feature is the parent unit locator, which helps you find the video baby monitor if you misplace it. Other impressive and comparatively hard-to-find features include an on-camera nightlight and a room thermometer. The camera also can run on AAA batteries instead of the A/C adapter in the event of a power failure. Unfortunately, the monitor unit doesn’t have a belt clip, making portability a little less than convenient.","We were a bit let down by the company’s comparative lack of help and support. The website displays a contact phone number and email, but no online chat or web contact form. The AC1120 doesn’t have an online manual. FAQs are mainly geared toward other models, but there is a troubleshooting section for the AC1120."]},"id":"9a550c11-6064-4979-93bc-caf4098fbf59","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2f19a2a5-68b7-4404-b081-e2ea157afe04","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, we feel that the drawbacks of the AC1120 model of the Angelcare AC11 baby video monitors don’t entirely outweigh the unit’s positive features, and therefore doesn&#39;t compete with the best baby video monitors out there.

Still, the AC1120 does offer at least the basics, making it more than capable of meeting most parents’ needs."]},"id":"7bb2cf80-308f-432e-b88d-16e07fc39a48","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56555","url":"/angelcare-ac11-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-30T13:06:54Z","datePublished":"2013-05-30T13:06:54Z","name":"Angelcare AC1120","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
