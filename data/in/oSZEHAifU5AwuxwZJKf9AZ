The sheer number of hot tub models at Cal Spas is a little overwhelming, especially since the website doesn’t offer a good way to directly compare models. Still, with twice as many models as most other <a href=\"/best-hot-tubs\">hot tub manufacturers</a>, Cal Spas is sure to have a hot tub that exactly fits your needs.","Like many other hot tub manufacturers, Cal Spas does not have any pricing information available without contacting a dealer. You can get an idea of the manufacturer’s model prices relative to one another based on the product line. For example, a hot tub in the Patio Spas line is likely to cost less than a model from the Escape line. ","Cal Spas 51 hot tubs are broken up into six product lines. Really, it’s three product lines, but each line has a regular and Plus sub-categories. The first line is the Patio line, which has eight models that use a 110 V outlet so you can install them without special electrical work. The Patio Spas seat three to six people. The Patio Plus Spas line has nine models, six of which are upgraded versions of Patio models with more jets, but require a 220V outlet. With the Escape and Platinum lines, the Plus models generally have more jets, as is the case with the Bel Air models, or an additional pump, like the Avalon models. Some hot tubs have more than a regular and a plus version of the same model. For example, there are two models in the Escape line called the Bel Air, though these hot tubs have different product numbers. The naming conventions used by Cal Spas isn’t clear, which is something to keep track of when shopping.","The Platinum Plus line, which has four models, has more customization options than other CalSpas hot tubs. For these top-of-the-line spas, you can choose between 10 jet configurations for your spa seats to personalize your spa to your hydrotherapy needs. Though this offers more customization than most hot tub brands, <a href=\"/bullfrog-spas-review\">Bullfrog Spas</a> offers better custom massage options.","As expected from a company that gives you so many model choices, Cal Spas also has a ton of upgrade options and features. In addition to the basics, Cal Spas also offers the Fountain of Youth hydrotherapy system that uses a bunch of tiny bubbles to increase the oxygen in the spa water. This gives the water a silkier feel and stimulates cell and collagen regeneration. Another exclusive to Cal Spas is the Adjustable Therapy seat, one seat in select spas that has adjustable jets. This lets you tailor your hydrotherapy further by controlling the power and type of jet blasts from low, rolling flow to a powerful, continuous burst. ","In addition to water filtration and chemical sanitization, Cal Spas offers salt water, UV-C and ozone water sanitation options. You can also opt to have your hot tub insulated with full foam, which is a good idea if your climate is regularly below freezing. Cal Spas also sells a variety of spa surrounds and steps. Entertainment options include waterfalls and fountains, Bluetooth sound system, additional LED lighting and Wi-Fi module."]},"id":"9b84bed6-53b7-4158-b54e-1455128de586","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"83e0f6e4-cb03-40a0-8d0d-4eee2c01c7fb","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Cal Spas is a great place to start shopping for a hot tub because it has so many choices, even if the website makes it a little difficult to compare models, features and prices.
