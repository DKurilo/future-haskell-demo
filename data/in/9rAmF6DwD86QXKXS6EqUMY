Pro Nano Titanium 3-in-1 Lock &#39;n Style Convertible Styler gives you versatility and flexibility with your hair that very few curling irons offer. This <a href=\"/best-curling-irons\">hair curler</a> features three different barrels that snap and lock into place. The barrels allow you to curl, spiral or add volume to your hair. Additionally, this curling iron can reach a high temperature of 430 degrees Fahrenheit, which is plenty of heat for even thick and coarse hair to lock in curls.","This curling iron stands out because of its excellent design. It features three different barrels that you can snap and lock onto the curling iron&#39;s handle. Each barrel provides a different type of curl. A 1-inch spring barrel is available to give you a tight curl. There is also a bubble wand, which is 1.25 to 1.75 inches. The bubble wand is particularly useful for thin and fine hair. It is also designed to give you a more spiral curl, and the wand allows you to get closer to your head and add more volume. Finally, there is a 1.5-inch hot brush, which is a heated barrel with heat-resistant combs around it.","We tested this product on all hair types and lengths. The variety of barrels provide versatility with your curls. The overall performance of this device is excellent, and its lightweight design makes it easy to hold and maneuver for long periods of time.","In addition to the variety of barrels, this hair curler can reach a temperature of 430 degrees Fahrenheit. This is one of the hottest curling irons we reviewed, and it provides plenty of heat for thick and coarse hair. However, it also offers five separate heat settings, so if you have thin or fine hair, you can choose a lower setting to avoid causing heat damage to your hair. The minimum temperature of this curling iron is 220 degrees Fahrenheit. Another curling iron with a wide temperature range is the <a href=\"http://staging.toptenreviews.com/health/wellness/best-curling-irons/farouk-chi-arc-review/?status=InProgress\">Farouk Chi Arc</a>, making it a good choice for different hair types.Â ","A heat-resistant glove is included with this hair styler to prevent the product from burning your fingers, particularly when you&#39;re using the curling wand. It does not feature any digital screens, which would enhance the ease of use. However, there is a power light on the iron, so when the curling iron is powered on and heated, a light will notify you.","The power cord on this curling iron is 7.8 feet long, making it one of the longest power cords we saw on this type of device. The best power cords are 8 to 9 feet long. Additionally, the power cord swivels, so you can easily reach the back of your head to curl your hair.","A two-year warranty comes with this curling iron. We would like to see a longer warranty, but two years is the average amount of time for these products. If you do have any problems or is-sues with the product, you can reach BaByliss representatives via email and telephone."]},"id":"36d12ce6-29a8-4aa9-b1bc-4832d0f138c3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"afe01165-d129-4aa6-8914-5939988a09c7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium 3-in-1 Lock &#39;n Style Convertible Styler allows you to choose the exact type of curl you desire without the need to purchase an additional curling iron.
