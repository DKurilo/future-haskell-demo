The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/beauty/best-electric-razors/\">Electric Razors</a> here.</em>","Comfort, control, convenience and reliability all contribute to the overall design of the Philips Norelco 1290X. The triple-rotary head of this electric razor makes it look like something from the future. Each rotary blade sits on an independent axis, which grants those blades unprecedented mobility. With the 1290X, you will only need  a couple of minutes to complete shaving.","One major criteria to consider when looking at electric shavers is how long the battery will last before it runs out of power. In the case of the 1290X, the battery life is 60 minutes, which is likely more than you will ever need. The manufacturer claims that this electric razor will get you through 20 days of regular shaving  before needing to be recharged. In that case, the 1290X is ideal for extended vacations when you don&#39;t want to bring along the stand. The battery requires about 60 minutes to charge, so you should keep that in mind.","If you don&#39;t want to deal with the mess of shaving cream or gel, then the 1290X gives you the ability to shave with a dry face. This electric razor is designed to allow you to shave the way that you want – it can handle just about anything you want. The attached trimming tool  helps you style and maintain your sideburns and other hair. The 1290X also provides you with a plethora of tools and options to get the job done. All you have to do is decide how you want to do it.","Skin irritation can be annoying for anybody and the 1290X does everything it can to avoid anything akin to razor burn. With highly mobile shaving heads and a special coating over those heads to help them glide along your skin, this electric razor won&#39;t cause much irritation. The best electric shaver will combine comfort and a close shave. The 1290X comes very close to that sweet spot, providing features to reduce discomfort and also to increase the effectiveness of every stroke.","You never have to worry about how much power is left in the battery because a touch-control display underneath the power button will always keep you informed. With the length of the battery life, it isn&#39;t likely that the Philips Norelco 1290X will run out of power unless you forget to charge it occasionally."]},"id":"49ba6931-adc8-41dd-bebf-62eca6d8f9f1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58047","url":"/philips-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T19:59:49Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T19:59:49Z","name":"Philips Norelco 1290X","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":29,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-10-30T19:59:49Z","id":"67gkKjYD426HTVGsuWH9b4","meta":{"title":"Philips Norelco 1290X Electric Razor Review - Pros and Cons","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
