Live monitoring security systems can be a costly investment, with locked-in annual contracts and expensive monthly premiums. For DIY-minded or budget-conscious homeowners, DIY home security systems constitute an effective and inexpensive alternative. The latest DIY alarm systems are smart, affordable and easy to set up.","With a do-it-yourself home security system, you pay for the hardware and install the system yourself. If something triggers the system, it alerts you via text message. Most of these systems, such as <a href=\"/home/smart-home/best-diy-alarm-monitoring/simplisafe-review/\">SimpliSafe</a>, <a href=\"/home/smart-home/best-diy-alarm-monitoring/iris-review/\">Iris</a> and <a href=\"/home/smart-home/best-diy-alarm-monitoring/piper-review/\">Piper</a>, are wireless and come with a mobile app that you can download onto your smartphone and use to control the system remotely. If you prefer to have professionals monitor your DIY security system, you might be looking for something in our other <a href=\"/best-diy-home-security\">DIY home security review</a>.","<strong>DIY Home Security: What to Look For</strong>","There is a dizzying array of DIY security systems on the market; which you choose largely depends on how you want to monitor your home and control the system. While pricing may be a strong determinant for budget-conscious shoppers, there are more important factors to consider when shopping for the right DIY system for your home, such as the following features:","<strong>Setup &amp; Usability<br/></strong>When it comes to <a href=\"/best-home-security-systems\">home security systems</a>, effectiveness and reliability shouldn’t equate confusion and complexity. The best DIY systems are easy to set up and offer an intuitive and straightforward user experience. Look for a system that provides plug-and-play devices, clear setup instructions and a user-friendly app that allows you to control the system from your preferred mobile device.","<strong>Control &amp; Customization</strong><br/>An appealing benefit of using a DIY wireless security system is that you can tailor it for your specific needs. You can choose the type and number of sensors and cameras that comprise the system. Many systems also let you add additional peripherals to augment the system whenever you want. This is beneficial because you can adapt the system if your family grows, you move into a new home or your security needs change over time.","The best DIY security systems also give you full control via an app. You can download the app onto your smartphone or Wi-Fi-enabled tablet. From there, you can arm and disarm the system, view real-time camera streams and control specific peripherals. Many apps also allow you to upload photos and rename certain sensors (e.g. back door sensor) for a more personalized and intuitive experience.","<strong>Service &amp; Support</strong><br/>Look for a system that’s backed by at least a one-year warranty. The warranty should apply both to security systems sold as kits and to devices purchased separately. Additionally, opting for a DIY system without live monitoring doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice customer support. Most systems come with technical support from the manufacturer. If you have an issue with a device or installation questions, you should be able to contact the manufacturer via telephone or email.","Do-it-yourself wireless security systems give you access to an affordable and legitimate security solution. If you’ve never been able to consider a home security system before, a DIY system may be the right option for your home and family."]},"id":"676c9ecb-f02f-45b8-8d2d-c20d286aaf66","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"9ec72491-aa0e-4657-9542-736fdbc722cc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A1D911K/?&tag=ttr_budget-3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1281[art|NA[pid|60286[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Fortress</a>","<a href=\"http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-7649290-10926682?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd_388553-41166-KIT651_0__%3FproductId%3D3735295&cjsku=388553-41166-KIT651\">Iris</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ESVCRJO/?&tag=ttr_budget-3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1281[art|NA[pid|60288[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">iSmartAlarm</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MB3LMP6/?&tag=ttr_budget-3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1281[art|NA[pid|60289[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Piper</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008E06CKA/?&tag=ttr_budget-3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1281[art|NA[pid|60291[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">SecurityMan</a>","<a href=\"http://simplisafe.com/home-security-system-classic\">SimpliSafe</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MP93BW/?&tag=ttr_budget-3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1281[art|NA[pid|60293[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">SkyLink</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057A2OY8/?&tag=ttr_budget-3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1281[art|NA[pid|60294[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Swann</a>","<a href=\"https://www.tattletale.com/shop/\">Tattletale</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHE9J56/?&tag=ttr_budget-3d-printer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1281[art|NA[pid|60296[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Viper Home</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"9e6e7c66-3be1-4d42-81d3-7fd6399be82d","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1281","url":"/best-diy-alarm-monitoring","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-20T17:25:50Z","datePublished":"2016-10-17T23:20:24Z","name":"DIY Alarm Monitoring Review","synopsis":"Affordable home security is within your reach with a DIY wireless security system.
