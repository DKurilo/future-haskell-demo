In fact, they are the <a href=\"/most-efficient-floor-standing-speakers\">most efficient</a> speakers we tested. These efficient speaker components are housed in a good-looking cabinet – we suggest against hiding the attractive platinum-color woofers behind the speaker cover, if possible.","These floor speakers have a unique way of delivering treble frequencies: The 6.5-inch midrange driver is responsible for all the midrange content as well as the high-frequency information. This is the only pair of speakers in our review that doesn’t have a dedicated high-frequency driver, which translated to smooth vocals in our music test and up-front dialogue in our movie test.","On the other hand, it yielded unpleasantly harsh-sounding treble frequencies during our movie test – so much so that one of our panelists squinted and turned her head every time a gunshot rang out in the movie. That’s not the reaction you want when listening to action-scene sound effects, and it can be fatiguing. The best performer in our movie test, the <a href=\"/emotiva-airmotiv-t1-review\">Emotiva T1</a>, did a better job of projecting a smooth and accurate sound.","Based on manufacturer specifications, this pair of speakers boasts the widest frequency response of the models in our review. To evaluate low-frequency accuracy in our music test, we listened to an electronic dance music track by Laxx called “Semi Auto.” BIC claims that the 8-inch low-frequency drivers can recreate frequencies as low as 25 Hz, which is nearly inaudible to the human ear. The speakers seemed to deliver low-frequency content but at a volume that was drowned out by the loud midrange content.","BIC covers the PL-89 II with an eight-year warranty, which is exceptional considering that most manufacturers cover their speakers for five years or less. You can contact the company via email or phone if you have any questions, but the user manual is currently unavailable for download on BIC’s website.","Because of its overemphasized midrange frequencies, these speakers are best suited to music with acoustic instruments like horns and strings. We suggest adding a subwoofer alongside these floor standing speakers if you plan on listening to bass-heavy music or frequently watch action movies."]},"id":"b97d9c10-0183-4232-a00b-dd96612713a7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54397","url":"/bic-acoustech-pl-89-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-02-09T20:33:40Z","datePublished":"2012-02-09T20:33:40Z","name":"BIC Acoustech PL-89 II","synopsis":"Because of their 98 dB sensitivity rating, the BIC Acoustech PL-89 II floor standing speakers can project sound at incredible volumes with very little  amplification.","review":{"rating":85,"verdict":"The PL-89 II reproduces quality vocals and dialogue in both music and movies, but high frequencies sound harsh and low frequencies tend to get drowned out.
