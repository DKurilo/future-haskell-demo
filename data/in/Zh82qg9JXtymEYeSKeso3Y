Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Bowflex is known for its excellence in fitness equipment, from bikes and elliptical machines to tread climbers and home gyms. The Bowflex Series 7 <a href=\"/best-treadmills\">treadmill</a> is part of this superior fitness family and provides you with the features you need to get a low-impact or high-cardio workout, to help you meet your fitness goals.","The heart rate monitor on this treadmill is an excellent way to measure your pulse before, during and after your workout. Your measured heart rate will appear on the console, enabling you to record the information for future personal or medical use. The metal pulse sensors are located on the front bars situated in the middle of the console and handrails. If you prefer not to grasp the handles to take your pulse, you can use the provided wireless chest strap. You should place this strap on your bare skin to get an accurate reading.","The Bowflex 7 treadmill console has 16 program buttons. You&#39;ll find options ranging from a manual mode where you select your workout time, incline and speed to preset programs such as cardio, running, fat burn, fitness test speed, calorie goal, a 5K run and more. We were impressed with the workout options on this treadmill, and we know you will appreciate variations in your workout routine as well.","The treadmill odometer is a simple feature, but it&#39;s one of our favorites as you can easily keep track of the total miles you have run. If you have a summer goal to run 200 miles, the odometer will store the mileage after each run, just like an odometer on a car. The Elevation Gain feature is also useful as it represents the total distance you have traveled during your treadmill workout session based on the miles and incline level.","The design of the Bowflex Series 7 treadmill is simple. Simple lines, simple color panel, simple console – nothing fancy, which is fine with us. Its low profile is unobtrusive, which is perfect if you want to position your treadmill in front of a television for workout entertainment.","Running takes a focus and drive that is quite inspirational. If you are too focused and forget you&#39;re on a treadmill, however, you may trip on a side rail or over your own feet, causing you to fall on the treadmill. The safety key is bright red and conveniently located for emergency grabs. During a workout, secure the clip attached to the safety key to your clothing. If you pull out the key, the treadmill will immediately stop. If you find yourself needing to stop the treadmill for another reason, press the power or stop button on the treadmill console, which will cause the belt immediately to stop.","Maintaining the health of your treadmill aids in its performance and your safety. The treadmill&#39;s walking belt, for example, needs regular lubrication to keep rotating smoothly. Your treadmill console will alert you when the belt needs lubrication, which is roughly every 250 miles of belt travel.","We just have to say &#34;thank you&#34; to those who have written the user manual for the Bowflex 7 treadmill. This user manual is categorized nicely, so you can find things quickly, and it is illustrated well, making your treadmill assembly as easy as possible. We were disappointed, however, that Bowflex does not offer live chat support or treadmill FAQs. And, although you can call a technical support number, make sure you do so early in the day, as the call center is closed after 5 p.m. They are also only open on weekdays.","A treadmill is an investment, which means you want it to last you a very long time. The Bowflex 7 warranty leaves us wanting as it is not equivalent to other treadmill warranties in its class. The frame and motor are the key components of the treadmill. The Bowflex Series 7 treadmill frame has a 15-year warranty, while the motor has only a 10-year warranty. Most treadmills in its class have lifetime warranties on the frame and motor. Parts and electronics both have a one-year warranty, which is dismal."]},"id":"2c164c90-5945-4474-afb6-e31b26c34416","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f07b66aa-5221-4436-bf30-96719d8ba402","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Whether you are purchasing this treadmill to lose weight, tone specific areas of your body, train for a 5K or to simply gain more self-confidence, the Bowflex Series 7<strong> </strong>treadmill has the capabilities to help you reach your fitness and personal goals.
