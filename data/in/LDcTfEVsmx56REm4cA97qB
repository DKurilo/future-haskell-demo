Doctors can diagnose your ailment and prescribe medications as needed. This service is for general, urgent but non-emergency illnesses only. It offers certified physicians with an average of 15 years&#39; experience each. This telemedicine service accepts insurances and works with major health care programs.","Also called Amwell, this is a popular <a href=\"/best-telemedicine-services\">telemedicine company</a> because you can speak to a qualified physician any time 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Using web-based streaming or a mobile app, you can consult with an online doctor to get a diagnosis and treatment, and, when needed, prescriptions sent to the pharmacy of your choice.","This telehealth service treats common non-emergency but urgent-care conditions, such as flu, pink eye and urinary tract infections. The physicians can also treat hypertension, allergies and gout. If you are suffering from migraines, you may find this service especially helpful because you can talk to the doctor while laying down quietly in your room. Also, if you have a question about a family member&#39;s health and need advice, these virtual doctors can provide that too.","This telemedicine company charges a set fee per visit, which is hundreds of dollars below an emergency room visit and not much higher than some copays. It also takes some insurances. You can enter your insurance information during the pre-visit process. In addition, it works with major health plans like United, Anthem, Highmark and some Blue Cross Blue Shield programs.","Amwell doctors are available in nearly all the states; the online map shows the exceptions. To speak to an online doctor, you first select one from the list. You can review the education and experience of each physician. Next, you answer some brief questions on your ailment. You can upload images (such as if you have a rash) and lab results at this time. Next, you choose your pharmacy in case you need a prescription. Then comes the painful part of putting in your payment information, and finally, you talk to the doctor.","Visits typically run 10 minutes, which is about the national average for common conditions. If you need to add more time, you can. These doctors do not replace your primary care physician, but serve to assist in non-emergency situations when it&#39;s not convenient to see your regular doctor. They can prescribe some medication but not controlled substances like narcotics or muscle relaxants. If you need a sick note for work, it can provide one if appropriate.","American Well connects you to a virtual doctor for common non-emergency situations. This telemedicine service lets you get advice and treatment for common but distressing situations, including stomach flu and UTIs. Doctors can diagnose and prescribe most medications as well. The visit fees are not much more than a copay, and it takes some insurances and works with some health care plans."]},"id":"2a9eed11-59d7-4703-b479-96463bbde5bb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68812","url":"/american-well-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-22T21:19:38Z","datePublished":"2016-11-22T21:19:38Z","name":"American Well","synopsis":"American Well (AmWell) offers 24/7 online doctor visits for one low fee.
