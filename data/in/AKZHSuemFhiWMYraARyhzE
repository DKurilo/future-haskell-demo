At $2.27 per milliliter, the ink it uses is just a little more expensive than that of the other art printers we reviewed. Even at that price, it’s more cost effective than the smaller snapshot printers in our review, which cost between 30 cents and 50 cents per photo. If you need to print in any sort of volume, this is a good photo printer to choose.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/69030-epson-expression11.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tid7HVpJ6oZjQmoXADZvy7.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"tid7HVpJ6oZjQmoXADZvy7","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tid7HVpJ6oZjQmoXADZvy7.jpg","alt":""},"id":"0066972f-1c6e-4278-aca0-37204970c589","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This top-rated photo printer can print up to 11 x 17-size pictures.
