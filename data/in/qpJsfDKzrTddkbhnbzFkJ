You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Backed by the international and manufacturing giant Samsung, the DMT400RHS <a href=\"/best-dishwashers\">dishwasher</a> offers what you’d expect for the price, and not much more. Despite lacking many innovative or unique features, this dishwasher performs well, a quality we expect from Samsung appliances.","This Samsung DMT400 dishwasher offers average energy consumption and sound level. The dishwasher uses 279 kilowatt-hours of energy, for a yearly operating cost of 30 dollars. The sound level is rated at 51 dBA. All of these stats fall squarely in the middle of the range other dishwashers we reviewed.","The features included in this dishwashing machine are rather limited to the basics. In addition to a sanitizing option, eco-friendly drying and a cancel and drain option, the dishwasher is both NSF and Energy Star rated, which helps indicate the standard level of performance for this type of device. While it offers the basics, major and convenient features like additional drying options, wash sensors and delayed timers are missing, which limits this dishwasher.","The Samsung DMT400RHS dishwasher gives a very unpresuming appearance, with a simple flat face and bar handle that displays three LED lights that indicate the dishwasher’s progress through a load. The integrated console is hidden on top of the door along the right-hand side, allowing you to quickly set cycles and run times. Additionally, the dishwasher&#39;s controls are touch sensitive. Aside from the stainless steel color, you can also get this unit in a black or white color.","Samsung is well known for its wide range of electronic products, which means they’ve got some practice in terms of technical support. The company offers all of the necessities and then some, including everything from phone and email support to tutorials and FAQs. This Samsung DMT400 dishwasher is backed by a standard warranty of one year for parts and labor in addition to five years for racks and electronics. There is lifetime coverage for tub and door liners."]},"id":"7d180b32-6324-469b-ae51-23412423c75f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b32cc2b6-48b8-4741-a915-6a7ba1ec61f7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Samsung DMT400RHS dishwasher is meant to be a mid-range dishwashing unit and succeeds quite well in this categorization.
