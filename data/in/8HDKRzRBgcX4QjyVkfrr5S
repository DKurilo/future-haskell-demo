None of the components are dishwasher-safe, but with some warm and soapy water, you can easily clean the freezer bowl.

One of the only downsides to this machine is the powerful, but unfortunately very loud, motor.

Even though the manual claims it takes about an hour to make and eat the ice cream, in our experience it takes at least an hour of mixing and lots of ice and rock salt to get a consistent ice cream texture. You will need to be prepared to spend the extra time and effort to create your dessert. In addition, you will have to deal with some design drawbacks. It has a short cord and no handles, making it tough to move around. It also doesn’t have an on-and-off switch, which means you’ll have to unplug the machine if you want to check on your mixture or if you need to add any ingredients – although the motor does have an automatic shutoff mechanism when it senses the mixture is at the right consistency.

The Oster 4 Quart FRSTIC-WDB-001 Ice Cream Maker also creates the most consistent ice cream, according to our testing panel, but not without a few headaches and some extra effort along the way.","This Oster ice cream machine requires a lot of rock salt, ice and preparation. The included recipe and instructions leave out some important info that we had to learn the hard way in our testing. We found that the first time you use the machine you must fill the bucket 2/3 of the way with water and let it soak for at least 90 minutes to let the wood expand, which is called “swelling.” Otherwise it will leak as the ice melts, and that messiness adds more time to cleanup. The instructions also didn’t state that we would need more ice and rock salt midway through the process.

In that time, we have mixed up countless batches of ice cream and tirelessly read through instruction manuals, user reviews and product specification pages. When we conduct our ice cream consistency tests, we have a panel of testers sample each batch from a machine multiple times and provide feedback.","We also document how long it takes to clean each ice cream maker. All our research, combined with our thorough hands-on testing, allows us to make strong recommendations.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We went through a lot of ice, rock salt and ice cream during our testing process. Our testing panel tasted multiple batches of ice cream from every machine to provide consistency ratings. To make the ice cream, we followed the specific instructions for each machine, refining our process and adjusting the amounts of ice and rock salt through multiple batches. We took notes on how easy each machine was to use; how useful the included instructions were and several other factors.","We also enlisted a taste testing panel of ice cream lovers who evaluated the flavor and especially the consistency of the ice cream that we had produced from each machine. Their opinions and ratings were incorporated into the scores that we gave each machine. Finally, we documented how long it takes to clean each machine for the next use. All these factors went into determining the best overall ice cream maker.","<strong>Here&#39;s What The Experts Have to Say</strong>","Lifestyle expert Martha Stewart loves making ice cream at home, and she notes in her “Up Close &amp; Personal” blog: “You might be surprised to know that making your own ice cream is 60% cheaper than buying a good quality brand. Plus, you can use all-organic ingredients, making it a much healthier dessert. Homemade ice cream is quite an easy task, providing you have an ice cream maker. Plus, it&#39;s really fun to create your own flavors or flavor combinations.”","Ina Garten, a Food Network star and author of several cookbooks, said she uses a simple Cuisinart ice cream maker for homemade ice cream, according to an article by Faith Durand in the online publication “Kitchn.”"," “‘A freeze-the-bowl model?’ I asked – surprised, as I expected her to have some super-fancy chef’s quality gelato machine,” Durand wrote. “But no, she (Garten) has the same sort of ice cream maker that most of us have, and she uses it all the time.”","<strong>How Much Do Ice Cream Makers Cost?</strong>","Home ice cream makers range in price from about $20 to nearly $90. Some higher-priced models have special linings that help chill their freezer bowl as well as more powerful electric motors. Still, a modestly priced, well-designed machine can make fine ice cream.","<strong>What to Look for in an Ice Cream Maker</strong>","Freeze Power<br/>If you make ice cream often, a freezer bowl is probably best for you. If you make ice cream just for special occasions and like to make a lot of ice cream, then the rock-salt-and-ice method is the best.","Prep &amp; Cleanup<br/>Knowing how long it takes to prepare ice cream and the cleanup afterward can be a key factor in your decision. If the amount of prep and cleanup time outweighs going to the store and buying ice cream, then a machine might not be for you.","Final Considerations<br/>Think about what matters to you in terms of storage space in your home, especially for some of the salt-and-ice models that are heavy and bulky. If you have plenty of storage space, this isn’t a concern, but if you have tight kitchen or limited storage space, consider which model will fit best in your home. Also, don’t automatically reject the recipes that manufacturers include with the model. It&#39;s true that with an ice cream maker, you&#39;ll be pinning recipes left and right, but the recipes that come with your machine are tailored for that appliance.","<strong>Making Your Own Ice Cream Keeps You In Control</strong>","When you make homemade ice cream, you can control what you put in it. For example, if you want to make healthier ice cream, you can use lower fat milk or even skim milk in place of the heavy cream. You can also reduce or increase sugar content, substitute honey, or use sugar substitutes.","In addition, making your own ice cream opens the way for experimenting with different flavors. Until recently, many Westerners had never heard of green tea matcha ice cream. It is popular in Asian countries, especially Japan, and with an ice cream maker, you can try it without shelling out lots of money for specialty ice cream at the grocery store.","A good electric or hand-cranked ice cream maker is also useful for people who have digestive troubles or who avoid animal products on principle. Anyone who is lactose intolerant or vegan can adjust ice cream recipes to use milk made of soy, almonds, cashews, peanuts, coconuts, or if you’re feeling really daring, hemp. As radical as it may sound, you don’t need to worry about getting your guests high on hemp ice cream. According to an <a href=\"https://honestmarijuana.com/hemp-milk/\">article</a> published by Honest Marijuana, “Hemp is a non-psychoactive variety of the Cannabis sativa plant. Hemp is non-psychoactive because it contains less than one percent of the<a href=\"https://honestmarijuana.com/cannabinoids/\">cannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)</a>,” which is the ingredient in marijuana that creates a high."]},"id":"f8cf56f2-9850-44dc-838d-d17b712519ee","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"3fd02e9c-d353-4249-8cbe-02d9696ce37b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/cuisinart-ice-review\">Cuisinart ICE-21</a>","<a href=\"/oster-review\">Oster FRSTIC-WDB-001</a>","<a href=\"/hamilton-beach-4-quart-review\">Hamilton Beach 4 Quart 68330N</a>","<a href=\"/hamilton-beach-1-5-quart-review\">Hamilton Beach 1.5 Quart 68880</a>","<a href=\"/cuisinart-pure-indulgence-review\">Cuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence</a>","<a href=\"/nostalgia-electrics-review\">Nostalgia 4 Quart ICMP400 BLUE</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"c2021e7d-a425-433b-a8e7-592fa486b90c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_239","url":"/best-ice-cream-makers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-22T13:34:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-22T13:34:00Z","name":"Best Ice Cream Makers of 2019","synopsis":"We made several batches of vanilla ice cream with each model to test ease of use, ease of cleaning, consistency and other factors.","review":{},"strapline":"We made several batches of vanilla ice cream with each model to test ease of use, ease of cleaning, consistency and other factors.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-15T20:26:39Z","id":"8HDKRzRBgcX4QjyVkfrr5S","meta":{"title":"Best Ice Cream Makers of 2019 - Reviews and Test Results","description":"We made several batches of vanilla ice cream with each model to test ease of use, ease of cleaning, consistency and other factors.
