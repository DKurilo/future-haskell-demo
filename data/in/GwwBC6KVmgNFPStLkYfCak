Few tires provide off-roading capabilities without sacrificing much of their on-road performance, but this <a href=\"/best-tires\">truck tire</a> excels in regards to both.

Relying on wraparound sidewall treads, the BFGoodrich Rugged Trail T/A is capable of retaining a maximum grip on precarious terrain without losing traction.","BFGoodrich advertises this tire as ideal for trucks and SUVs driven on paved surfaces with the need to go off road on occasion. The tire succeeds quite well in that respect, providing adequate levels of roll resistance and grip on loose terrain such as dirt and gravel. It isn’t until you try traversing mud that it loses some traction and control. However, it isn’t a mud tire and is not designed for such terrain.","This tire is designed to perform well on dry, wet and snowy pavement. It doesn’t offer perfect traction and gripping under icy conditions, but few all-season and moderate off-road tires prove themselves capable of dealing with ice as well as dedicated snow tires. The design of the treads gives this tire more of an advantage over competitors for on-road wear. The greater depth of the tread means it wears longer than most other comparable tires and will easily exceed its life warranty of 50,000 miles.","For truck owners in need of tires that perform well on the road, but still allow for comfortable and safe travel in mild off-road conditions, the BFGoodrich Rugged Trail T/A is one of the best tire options available. It combines a deep tread design with the reliability of the manufacturer’s brand name to deliver a long-lasting and effective tire. With an extended tread life, precision handling at high speeds, and quiet road noise, this is a tire that will appeal to most truck and SUV owners."]},"id":"877b94f0-a82b-404c-bf2b-ab2fdfed165b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58238","url":"/bfgoodrich-rugged-trail-t-a-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-19T20:22:54Z","datePublished":"2013-11-19T20:22:54Z","name":"BFGoodrich Rugged Trail T/A","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
