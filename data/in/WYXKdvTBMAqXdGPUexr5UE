You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Ducane Affinity Series 4100 has a simple, sleek design, but it is one of the best <a href=\"/best-gas-grills\">gas barbecue grills</a> available. It lacks a side burner, which is disappointing, but the main burner can reach high temperatures without using too much fuel. In addition, it&#39;s made with sturdy stainless steel and has two side shelves for extra storage. The Ducane website could use some improvements, but, for the most part, we are pleased with the 4100 gas grill.","Four stainless steel burners line the bottom of the Ducane Affinity Series 4100 gas grill. These burners can generate up to 48,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units). BTUs should not be the only factor in deciding what grill is best, but it is a good measurement as to how hot a grill can get and how much gas it will use in the process. This grill&#39;s 48,000-BTU rating is high enough to get well-done burgers fairly quickly, but it&#39;s not so high that you&#39;ll burn through tanks of propane at each backyard barbecue party. We would have liked to see a side burner or rotisserie burner on this gas grill, but some people may not need those extra features and will be perfectly happy with just four burners.","With the primary cooking area and the warming rack area combined, this gas grill features approximately 693 square inches of grilling space. This size is average for the grills we reviewed, but it should be more than enough space for most meals and parties. Moreover, the warming rack will allow you to keep everything at the right temperature until it&#39;s time to eat. There is also a built-in thermometer on the lid to ensure that you know how hot your cooking area is.","You can choose either the liquid propane or natural gas model of the 4100. Propane used to be practically the only way to fuel a gas grill, but natural gas is quickly becoming a popular alternative. Connecting your grill to a natural gas pipeline negates the needs to refill a tank and natural gas is generally less expensive than liquid propane. No matter which option you choose, the Ducane Affinity Series 4100 has you covered.","This gas grill measures 29 inches deep, 58 inches wide and 62 inches tall, with the lid open. It should fit on most patios or decks without a problem. Even though it weighs 178 pounds, you&#39;ll be able to move it around almost effortlessly with the four casters on the bottom.","The stainless steel cooking grate on this gas grill is resistant to rust, and the porcelain enamel coating on the grates make it easy to clean. The cooking surfaces are also scratch-resistant, so your Ducane grill will continue to look new after prolonged use.","There&#39;s not much to the Ducane customer support page. On the website, there is simply an email address, a phone number and a postal address. We also had some issues with the online manual. It crashed our Firefox browser each time we tried to open it. There is no FAQs page, but if you have any questions, you can call their customer support team."]},"id":"849d4959-78b2-4520-92d4-b50d51a3d5c2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5cc5b101-0e1b-4d8a-95ea-bb0366aeddc5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you want a simple, well-made gas grill, the Ducane Affinity Series 4100 should be among your top choices.
