You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Bissell OptiClean Compact Canister Vacuum 1535 is a budget model that uses cyclonic technology to break up dust before it&#39;s emptied in the dust cup. This helps remove allergens from the air and makes emptying the dust cup a cinch. Its 10-amp motor was adequate, but in our tests, this <a href=\"/home/vacuum-carpet-cleaning/best-budget-vacuums/\">budget vacuum</a> struggled with bigger jobs as well as medium-pile carpets.","We tested this vacuum on both low-pile and medium-pile carpet. The Bissell left the carpet spotless, but it required several passes. For larger messes and pet hair, it didn&#39;t perform as well as the best budget vacuums on our lineup. The vacuum lacks suction and couldn&#39;t pick up several embedded pet hairs. For pet owners, this is not the best choice for a budget vacuum. On a positive note, it does have a brush roll button, which adjusts the rotating bristles to make it easier to clean tile or linoleum floors.","The Bissell OptiClean was one of the easiest vacuums to carry and store. The canister is small, and the entire vacuum weighs only 8 pounds, making it one of the lightest vacuums in our lineup. (The Eureka AS One also weighed 8 pounds.) A handle on top of the canister makes carrying the vacuum more comfortable. Despite its light weight, the canister doesn&#39;t move well. The wheels have trouble moving, and we struggled with the hose to get the canister to move in the desired direction.","This is a bagless model with a dust cup that clips off. A light indicates when the bin is full, and it’s not difficult to detach the dust cup from the base. Dirt and debris are broken up into smaller pieces during vacuuming, which makes it fall right out of the cup and into the garbage.","The best thing about this vacuum is how quiet it is. At 85 decibels, the OptiClean was the quietest model we tested. Vacuums are typically one of the loudest appliances you operate in your home, but this vacuum&#39;s noise level is reasonable.","Bissell offers a standard one-year warranty as well as a high level of online customer support. You can reach the company by phone and email, and you can find videos, FAQs as well as cleaning tips on the website."]},"id":"7e50ab16-6c2a-4634-a429-a37539d4ae6c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"611586bf-a4b7-48f1-91e9-696eb1c57fee","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bissell OptiClean Compact Canister Vacuum 1535 is a quiet, low-maintenance vacuum that is lightweight and storable.
