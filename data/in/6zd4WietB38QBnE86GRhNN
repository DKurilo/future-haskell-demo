We judged the software by comparing each application’s conversion fidelity, speed, ease of use, and device optimization features.","We also reached out to video and media professionals who use these types of programs every day to see what they value in their own video conversion software.","We spoke to Drew Tyler, instructor of digital media at Weber State University. He stressed the importance of having the right kind of video format for each video platform. He also noted that different cameras speak different languages, so it’s important to have a program that will convert for common and obscure video file formats to ensure that all devices communicate together during the editing process.","When asked what the most important thing is to consider when purchasing a video converter, Tyler said, “Look for ease of use. So many factors that go into compression, there are people who get paid a lot of money to do it professionally. Look for the software that gives you the presets that are easiest to choose. Avoid the hassle and let it do the thinking.”","Greg Andersen, of Andersen Media in South Weber Utah, stressed that not all video converters are created equal, and that he looks for programs that retain 100% quality. He noted that you won’t get a better video than what you put in, but you should at least get one of equal quality. He also noted that the ability to add a watermark makes it easier to deliver a video that a client can evaluate, but not use until they pay. Most importantly, he says a converter should be as comprehensive as possible when it comes to format choices.","Andersen said, “The reason for having the correct file format is that there are so many different platforms that require different formats. It’s important for me to have a program that is compatible with formats that my client needs. Some want MOV or AVI or MP4, and I need to be able to deliver that, and need to have a program that’s all inclusive.”","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We subjected each video converter program we reviewed to a battery of tests. They included usability tests, quality and timing tests. The results of these tests were weighed against the reviewer’s personal experience with each program to come up with their final score.","Ease of Use Test<br/>This test began with an evaluation of the software’s interface. We noted how long it takes to learn and perform common tasks such as loading a video into the program, selecting a profile and starting a conversion. We then moved on to the more advanced aspects of each program, keeping track of how accessible features were, how intuitive they were to use, and if their functions were clearly explained for the user.","Quality Tests<br/>We converted dozens of videos during our testing phase. We picked a graphics-intensive video to convert with each program, then examined the results and compared it to the original. Our video experts looked for imperfections such as compression artifacts, motion blur and pixelation. They noted how pronounced each problem was and whether it would be a distraction to the average viewer. Each program was given a grade based on this evaluation.","Timing Tests<br/>Lastly, we timed each program as it converted an hour-long video. Some products took longer than an hour to complete this task, while the fastest took only a few minutes.","<strong>Key Features to Look For<br/></strong><br/>Video &amp; Audio Format Conversion Choices<br/>All the programs we chose to evaluate for this category have all the most popular video file formats available for conversion. Included among these are MOV, AVI, MP4, FLV and MKV. But some programs offer not-so-common formats such as XVID, SWF and 3GP. Most users won’t find much use for the more obscure formats, but video professionals will be glad to know they’re there. You should also have the option to convert a video into an audio file, which is great for video games, lectures or other videos where the sound is the star. Formats such as MP3, M4A, WAV and AIFF should all be included, but others will be available depending on the program. Make sure you check that the software you choose supports all the file formats you need.","Optimization Profiles<br/>The best video converter software doesn’t end with simply swapping out one file extension for another. They all include a library of preprogrammed optimization profiles that tailor videos for playback on specific devices such as smartphones, tablets, gaming systems, televisions and set-top boxes. Choices in these libraries range from fewer than 50 to more than 400. The larger libraries cover more devices and specific models, while smaller libraries tend to focus on brands and device types.","Customization Tools<br/>There are times when you don’t want to convert an entire video file. The best video converter software will provide some basic video editing tools that allow you to trim, crop and enhance your video. This allows you to remove unwanted footage, add effects and adjust picture values such as hue, saturation and contrast, so you get exactly what you want out of every conversion.","How Much Does Video Converter Software Cost?<br/>","All the programs we reviewed will cost you in the neighborhood of $50. Most video converter programs range from $40 to $60. And given the disparity in performance from best to worst, you probably want to spend the extra $10 to get one that has everything offered.","<strong>What’s the Difference Between MP4, MOV and AVI?</strong>","You’ll have to decide which file type to convert your videos to. Here’s a rundown of the most common file types and their characteristics:","MP4 - This file type is highly compatible with other platforms, which makes it one of the most popular video file types today. MP4 compresses files into smaller sizes than other file types, making them easier to store and share. MP4 also captures high-quality video without blurring your imagery. This file type is considered the standard media file, and it plays on both Windows and Apple devices.","MOV - This file type was originally created by Apple as a support for QuickTime media player. Although it was created for Mac, it also works on Windows. However, it doesn&#39;t always work as well on non-Apple platforms. This file type is great for storing and sharing high-quality video. It sometimes creates larger files than MP4, but the two file types are mostly interchangeable. MOV files can be converted to MP4 files easily.","AVI - Microsoft created this file type specifically for use with Windows Media Player. Although this file type used to be the most popular due to its high compatibility, Microsoft no longer updates it. Therefore, AVI is often incompatible with newer and more advanced software. If you have a choice, it’s better to use MP4 or MOV.","If you’re working on an Apple device and know that your video will be edited and played on other Apple software, it&#39;s a good idea to save your video as a MOV file. However, if you plan to share your video more widely online, consider going with the MP4 standard because it can be read by more platforms.","<strong><br/>More Guides for Converting Files:</strong>"]},"id":"422b681b-1866-467e-8011-d0806c6c77de","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-audio-editing-software\">The Best Audio Editing Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-audio-converter-software\">The Best Audio Converter Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-mac-video-converter\">The Best Video Converter Software for Mac</a>","<a href=\"/best-professional-video-editing-software\">The Best Professional Video Editing Software</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"5c0fe852-0325-4b9e-afc4-67609542680c","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_66","url":"/best-video-converter-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
