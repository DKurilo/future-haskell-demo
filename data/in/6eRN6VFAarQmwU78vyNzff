comes to <a href=\"/best-digital-voice-recorders\">affordable digital voice recorders</a> for students, there isn’t a better option than the Sony ICD-UX533. This digital voice recorder has been around for years, and it’s one of the most popular handheld recording devices online. In our tests, it handily outperformed the Sony ICD-PX440. While both devices feature two microphones with decent stereo imaging, the ICD-UX533 records at a higher bit rate and has a better noise reduction filter. It’s also the smallest device we tested – at just 1.44 x 3.99 inches, it’s only slightly bigger than most flash drives.","The Sony ICD-UX533 is extremely easy to use. You just turn it on and hit record, and when you’re done, you hit play to play back what you captured. That’s it. The menu isn’t overloaded with superfluous features you’ll never use. There are a few prerecording options and a few post-audio options, and that’s it. A student shouldn’t have to study a manual to use their recording device.","Prior to recording, you can choose from five audio-quality formats: LPCM 44.1kHz/16-bit, MP3 192kbps, MP3 128kbps, MP3 48kbps (mono) and MP3 8kbps (mono). It also has different EQ recording filters for specific situations: meeting, lecture, voice notes, interview, music and custom. This takes the guesswork out of recording the best audio in a given situation.","Its playback features are excellent as well. After recording, you can slow down the audio so it’s easy to transcribe, cut large audio files and remove dead air. The best feature is the noise-cut filter, which removes ambient frequencies. When we applied the filter to recordings of our lecture-like meetings in the tests, it minimized chatter, breathing, coughs and other unnecessary noises. This allowed the speaker’s voice, which is naturally quiet, to stand out clearly.","This digital voice recorder doesn’t have many cons for students wanting to record lectures and study groups. It’s small and affordable, and it has 4GB of storage and a rechargeable battery with a 30-hour battery life. That said, the audio we recorded wasn’t much higher quality than that taken with an app on a smartphone. Sure, the sound recorded in stereo versus the mono recording of a smartphone, but the noise reduction filters on the smartphone were better.","The Sony ICD-UX533 is one of the most intuitive digital voice recorders available. Its storage, battery, filters and recording options make it a good choice for any student looking for a simple but effective voice recorder. However, the lack of additional features means it&#39;s barely one step above using a smartphone with a dictation app."]},"id":"ae799e6a-5ce8-4bb9-820f-28da30cfd0c2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57011","url":"/sony-icd-ux-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-07-15T19:18:31Z","datePublished":"2013-07-15T19:18:31Z","name":"Sony ICD-UX533","synopsis":"When it comes to affordable digital voice recorders for students, there isn’t a better option than the Sony ICD-UX533.","review":{"rating":79,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"When it comes to affordable digital voice recorders for students, there isn’t a better option than the Sony ICD-UX533.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-07-15T19:18:31Z","id":"6eRN6VFAarQmwU78vyNzff","meta":{"title":"Sony ICD-UX533 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Sony ICD-UX533 is a small digital voice recorder that&#8217;s easy to use.
