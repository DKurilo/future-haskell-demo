You can use it as a dedicated home computer, though its small size allows for portability. It isn’t as powerful as traditional units but has plenty of connectivity options making it a fair option, especially for Apple product lovers.","This mini desktop is sleek and has a fourth-generation Intel i5-4260U processor. However, the clocked CPU speed of 1.4GHz paired with its 4GB memory may limit your ability to use multiple programs at the same time or large programs. If you feel like you need more power, you can opt for a model with a more powerful processor or more memory when you purchase directly from Apple. The computer uses an Intel HD Graphics 5000 graphics card.","While other desktop computers have 1TB or 2TB of storage, this machine only has 500GB. This is still a decent amount of storage for most users, and you can always use cloud storage or an external hard drive should you require more.","Despite having less surface area than a traditional tower, the mini still comes with a full variety of ports so you can stay connected. It has four USB 3.0 ports – up to par with the top-ranking towers we reviewed. While it doesn’t have any USB 2.0 ports, it has two impressively fast Thunderbolt 2 ports. It also has an HDMI port, an SDXC slot and Gigabit Ethernet. In addition, it has built-in Bluetooth and 802.11ac Wi-Fi, providing you with further connectivity options.","One of the Mac mini’s biggest perks is – as the name implies – its small size. Measuring 7.7 inches square and 1.4 inches tall, this mini machine goes beyond space saving by being sleek, modern and even portable, should you require it. It is also one of the most affordable desktop computers we reviewed.","Apple has extensive support options available, whether you prefer to visit an Apple store in person or talk with its reps via email or live chat. Depending on whether or not you’re still under the included one-year warranty, you may even have access to free tech support via phone. You also have the option to extend the warranty on your Mac mini up to three years for an extra charge."]},"id":"ad775840-52dc-4d9f-ae01-06b3bf2a0811","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"69f97963-ea0c-4f15-870a-20941a83c21d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you aren’t a stickler for powerful processors or ample memory and just need a simple, small and functional computer – or an affordable Apple desktop - without the hefty price tag, the Apple Mac mini is an option.
