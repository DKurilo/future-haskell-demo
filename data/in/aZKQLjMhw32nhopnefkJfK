Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The VTech DS6151 is the third cordless phone we reviewed from this Hong Kong-based manufacturer. VTech has surged into a leading role when it comes to <a href=\"/best-cordless-phones\">cordless phones</a> – as well as quite an extensive variety of other consumer electronics. However, this model is just average. While it can accommodate a lot of handsets, it has a relatively short battery life and lacks some of the extras that the best cordless phones offer.","The VTech DS6151 provides a rather lean seven hours of talk time from a fully charged battery, which is not very much. However, it can be expanded to accommodate up to 12 handsets from a single phone jack, which makes it highly practical for many households and small businesses. You also can connect to two different phone lines. This can add another dimension of usefulness if you do something like operate a home-based business.","It does not include Bluetooth capability, which can be limiting for households that have gone to cell phone-only living. It also does not have a headset jack or an alarm. This phone includes a caller ID, a call waiting ability that lets you see who is calling while you are talking to someone else, a digital answering system that can hold up to 13 minutes of messages, and a phone book directory that you can fill with 50 entries. The blue backlit LCD display is quite big and easy to read, as is the backlit keypad, which is a boon if you have individuals in your household who have limited vision. There also are handset volume controls that can be adjusted as needed.","This phone does offer a base speakerphone, unlike a number of other models. Besides the keypad on the base handset, you also get an extra keypad on the base itself that includes oversized buttons and numerals.","This cordless phone has convenient and varied intercom capabilities: You can communicate handset to handset, base to handset and handset to base. If this is something you would use often, then this cordless phone is the choice for you and the lack of Bluetooth capability is perhaps not a particular concern. You also can conference an outside call between handsets.","The VTech DS6151 is easy to set up and use. Anyone who absolutely needs the Bluetooth capability would be smart to choose another model, but if you want plenty of flexibility with the intercom system, the VTech DS6151 works nicely.","You get a one-year limited warranty with the VTech DS6151 cordless phone, which insures the device against manufacturing error and material failure. If you have any questions about the phone, you can consult the user manual that comes with the phone. Another user manual is available online. For more information, you can consult the online FAQs section or contact customer support through email or by telephone."]},"id":"6134bb18-7d2b-4b64-ba1f-ce8d07666a23","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5acfb8ee-f526-4c86-b0ae-8481a9e701c8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You get a reasonable number of features with the VTech DS6151, and for many consumers, it will provide the level of usefulness that is exactly right for their needs.
