You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Kenmore 70085 <a href=\"/best-wall-air-conditioners\">wall air conditioner</a> is energy efficient and gives you full control over temperature, air flow intensity and direction. Plus, it has a programmable timer. The system’s 8,000 BTUs (British thermal units) are powerful enough to cool a room of 350 square feet. It’s less powerful than other units, which makes it better equipped for small dwellings over large open spaces.","Its maximum air flow of 273 cubic feet per minute will help cool your room quickly. This ratio is higher for this unit than others in our lineup. Three fan speeds allow you to choose which flow intensity you want to experience. It also uses R-410a type refrigerant to cool your air, which is environmentally friendly.","This unit has an energy-efficient ratio of 9.4, which is on par with the average for units in our lineup. It also has the lowest estimated annual energy cost, coming in at $73.44 for three months of use for eight hours a day. The system is ENERGY STAR certified and has passed public safety testing.","The fan-only mode gives you the option to use the air conditioning or run only the fan for a breeze. The sleep-mode feature starts the air conditioner at a cool temperature and gradually raises the temperature. This is good if you’re sleeping, as it reduces wasteful electricity consumption. When you are awake and wanting to save money, you can use the energy-saver mode, which runs at a slightly warmer temperature.","With the included remote control, you can control the air conditioner at a distance instead of having to use the device’s interface for everything. You can also take advantage of the programmable timer feature, which gives you the option to set a specific time for the air conditioner to turn on or off.","It measures 14-1/2 inches tall, 19 inches deep and 24 inches wide, and is one of the smallest on our lineup. It is also the lightest unit, weighing just 60 pounds, though it does not come with a sleeve for installation. The air filter is made of polypropylene mesh, and it is easy to access, clean and replace. You can adjust the air flow with the four-way directional louvers.","You can contact Kenmore’s customer service any time with questions or concerns about your product. The company is available via telephone and email, though Kenmore does not have a live-chat feature on its website. Kenmore also has a product manual on the website as well, should you ever need to refer to it."]},"id":"2123e9a9-81ea-49ad-a0b8-5b8fa5291a21","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"18e72c8a-3e5c-4017-a937-5a8370af5301","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore 70085 wall air conditioner works well for small areas.
