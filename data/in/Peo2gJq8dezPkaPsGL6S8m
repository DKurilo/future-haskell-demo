It is stylishly designed and allows access to your home through either a card or fingerprint scan. Members of the household can be programmed in, and the electronic lock has five slots for temporary users, like your nanny or guests. The smart door lock is easy to program. However, the company website is hard to navigate and customer support could be better.","The design of the electronic door lock is stainless steel construction with black accents, a polished chrome finish and a blue fingerprint reader. The Anviz lock is a latch, not a knob. The lock comes standard with an RFID key tag, so if the fingerprint scanner is not working, you can also open the lock with a card. In case of an emergency or if the lock runs out of power completely, backup keys are also included.","The Anviz L100II Lock runs on four AA batteries that will last for up to 5,000 uses. Depending on your needs, how often you have to replace the batteries will vary. A small family won&#39;t have to replace the batteries for up to six months. If it’s a busy office, however, you should expect to change the batteries more frequently. When the power has run out, the remote door lock will revert to an emergency 9-volt battery, a nice feature that will make sure you’re not locked out.","Programming your fingerprints on the Anviz L100II Lock is simple. Hold down your fingertip for five seconds, the lock memorizes your imprint and access is granted. The main gatekeeper can add or remove access for people, and you can completely reset the lock as well. This isn’t the most advanced fingerprint reader available though. For example, the company recommends taking several imprints for the same person whenever you want to open your door, instead of just one. Still, for the price, it’s an affordable reader.","The company offers support through its website. There is a remote desktop support tool you can download, but, after a request is put in, there is still a delayed response of a few days. If you lose the instructions, bayou can download them online. The language is a bit difficult to read, however."]},"id":"4a5c2f4d-2819-4682-b4a5-fdec487786c0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ff670790-5f16-41c1-a6e3-0a79c602692d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, the Anviz L100II Lock is designed well and has an average battery life.
