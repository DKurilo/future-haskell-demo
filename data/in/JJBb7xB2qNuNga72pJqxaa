These applications work with advertising, brochures, magazines, books and newspapers. With QuarkXPress, you can also create applications, digital magazines and eBooks for tablets. Features such as callouts and ImageGrid give you the tools to import grids that automatically move with the flow of your text. These applications are all about layout automation and allow you to design quickly and efficiently.","<strong>Word Processing vs. Page Layout</strong>","Although page layout software offers features similar to word processing applications, the two should not be confused. Word processing handles the writing and editing of content, with some limited design capabilities. However, first and foremost, these act as an electronic typewriter where you can edit, move, delete, save and print simple documents. Page layout software delves more deeply into the realm of design, allowing you to become your own printing press. You can configure the size of a publication and its overall layout, and you have greater control over the formatting of text and paragraphs.","Both word processing and page layout applications serve a specific function in the development of publications. Whereas in one it’s easier to write copy, in another it’s easier to create unique layouts reminiscent of larger publications in circulation. Page layout software enables you to produce documents that combine text with graphics and is thus more preferable when designing things like newsletters, magazines and brochures, when layout is most important.","The comparison between application types ultimately comes down to the perception of quality. To make a publication look like it was produced professionally, it must meet certain standards associated with that publication type. Otherwise, you’re less likely to attract buyers. Page layout software gives you maximum control over the appearance of a page, all the way down to the position of type on that page. Many such capabilities are difficult or impossible to accomplish in a word processor, which means you’ll want something with superior text and graphic handling.","<strong>Page Layout vs. Desktop Publishing</strong>","Depending on who you talk to, page layout and desktop publishing software are used interchangeably. Truthfully, the two are arguably synonymous, but they actually indicate different grades or complexity of software. Desktop publishing is most often associated with at-home publishing, which means the application is cheaper, but it also focuses largely on basic features associated with page layout. Thus, such applications are easy to learn and use for basic publications.","In comparison, page layout software traverses closer to the enterprise or business level of software. These applications offer both simple and complex features alike but allow you to create publications professional and unique in appearance. If you’re planning on self-publishing a single book, you likely won’t be able to justify the expense or extensive training required to use page layout software and you should instead consider desktop publishing. But if you’re a business or freelancer that plans on doing multiple publications, then page layout software is better suited to your needs. Likewise, if you plan on interacting at greater depth with printing presses, you’ll want to consider page layout applications that accommodate the more complex and rigid expectations associated with such a relationship.","While the more economic decision is to consider desktop publishing, consider how this may still affect the appearance of your publication. Basic layout tools will only help you so far in making something look professionally produced. For greater control, whether you are a professional and self-taught designer, you will want to pick page layout software.","<strong>Outputs</strong>","Page layout applications offer a wide range out file outputs, meaning you can create a variety of publications from a single application. You aren’t restricted solely to PDF format, and you can create files in various outputs for a variety of purposes. For example, some software allows you to create eBook-reader-friendly publications, such as EPUB or MOBI files. Other applications allow you to generate HTML websites, XML files and even images from the original layout. This is because the world of printing is a multifaceted one where a single publication can find consumers throughout the digital and physical market. With page layout software, you can increase the reach of a publication to greater distances across media.

There are several things to consider besides the price, and we explore the features that will help your publications stand out.","<strong>Layout &amp; Organization</strong><br/>Page layout software can be complicated, so finding a user-friendly workspace makes your workflow quicker and more accessible. Having the ability to group objects, work with layers and arrange your objects can give you the greatest satisfaction from your software. Find software that has project templates that let you jump right in and that let you turn the snap-to-grid alignment on or off. We also noticed the best page layout software lets you quickly reconfigure paragraphs to span more than one column, such as a headline, without creating separate text frames.","<strong>Graphic &amp; Design Tools</strong><br/>No page layout application is complete without the option to create and manage your own graphics. While many programs let you add photos and have artistic filters and several drawing tools, the best applications go further by letting you design smartphone apps, eBooks and even QR codes. You should also look for software that has options to blend colors, add effects to photos, and create easy grids and guides.","<strong>Text Options</strong><br/>Every print design program lets you drop text into your projects, but the best ones let you create sophisticated typography. This means you can create drop caps as well as text on a certain path you outline. If you want to take standard text to the next level, look for programs that allow you to apply visual effects and convert letters to editable shapes.","Layout software serves a variety of your digital publishing needs. Whether you want to use this software to create a magazine layout, self-publish your first novel or see what your website may look like, make sure that you find the right software that both fits what you will use it for and your budget.","For more information and hints on how these products work, check out our <a href=\"/electronics\">articles on page layout software</a>."]},"id":"be842404-19f9-4116-95a3-823167d6708f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"88a4dd80-254a-4b45-8c05-0b27a1718b76","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=264355&a=2856467&g=22804962&url=https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html\">InDesign</a>","<a href=\"http://track.webgains.com/click.html?wglinkid=266209&wgcampaignid=75640\">PagePlus</a>","<a href=\"http://shop.quark.com/default.aspx\">QuarkXPress</a>","<a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-5402756-10274094-1463178368000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coreldraw.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fgraphic-design-software%2F%3Fdv%3D1&cjsku=ESDCDGSX8AM\">CorelDraw</a>","<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Cty0dj6o3sg&subid=&offerid=402138.1&type=10&tmpid=6075&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoftstore.com%2Fstore%2Fmsusa%2Fen_US%2Fpdp%2FproductID.323025400\">Publisher</a>","<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-5402756-10502971-1220035881000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.broderbund.com%2Fp-869-the-print-shop-professional-40.aspx&cjsku=4140\">The Print Shop Professional</a>","<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/framemaker.html\">Adobe FrameMaker</a>","<a href=\"http://www.creativeoutlet.com/creatorsoftware/\">Creator Professional</a>","<a href=\"http://www.pagefocus.com/pfpro.html\">PageFocus Pro</a>","<a href=\"http://www.pagestream.org/\">PageStream</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3eb74802-0f2d-4fcc-82c6-3e72c0f8f700","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_887","url":"/best-page-layout-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-07-19T14:08:51Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T20:45:23Z","name":"Page Layout Software Review","synopsis":"Page layout software is an easy way to combine graphics and text to make anything from magazines to webpages.
