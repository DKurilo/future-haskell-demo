The original review is below, but check out our current reviews of the best <a href=\"/best-walk-in-tubs\">Walk-In Tubs</a>.</em>","The Ella Ultimate 93217 is more like a spa than a traditional bathtub. This walk-in bathtub includes everything you could want in a bathtub and shower combo. What sets this safe step tub apart from other walk-in tubs is its triple massage system.","This Ella model includes water jets and air jets for a total of 26 jets, which are placed to massage your back, legs and feet. The built-in seat is 20 inches wide and contoured for comfort. The faucet fills the tub at 18 gallons per minute, so you won&#39;t sit in the cold for long. This walk-in tub also comes with a dual drain system, so your tub empties quickly.","The safety features of this Ella bathtub are what you&#39;d expect of any walk-in tub. It has a low threshold of 8.5 inches, so it&#39;s easy to step in and out, and if that isn&#39;t low enough, you have the option of lowering it to 5.5 inches. This isn&#39;t quite considered a handicap bathtub, because the narrow door doesn&#39;t provide wheelchair access, but it does include two grab bars, which offers you stability as you sit or stand in the tub. The textured floor is designed to prevent slipping.","You get several added accessories with this walk-in tub, including a swivel tray to hold your bath supplies and a five-piece faucet set with a retractable handheld shower. Even the drain opener is designed for those with limited movement – the extension handle makes it easy to grip and turn.","Although this tub is a similar size to traditional bathtubs and fits in a standard bathtub alcove, it is much deeper and can hold up to 95 gallons of water unoccupied. The frame is made of stainless steel, and the tub shell is made of acrylic with a glossy finish that&#39;s easy to clean. The cost of a safe step tub like this is higher than for traditional tubs and basic soaker tubs, but the warranties mean you don&#39;t have to worry about pricey repairs or replacements. Ella offers a lifetime warranty on the frame, door, seal and shell. All of the other parts are covered by a five-year warranty."]},"id":"5df9f0d8-9f3d-4e00-8f7a-ca0170779199","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68022","url":"/ella-ultimate-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
