This <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/56811-educational-toys-for-elementary-students.html\">chemistry set</a> is safe for children, using only household chemicals, but that does not detract from the experiments.","There are 25 experiments in all, covering such areas as chemical identification, acids and bases, crystallization, the composition of inks and dyes, and the properties of oils, soap and water. Children can find out what makes sparkling water sparkle, study the makeup of inks and dyes, and even make their own perfume.","Young chemists also get to make their own test tube racks from plaster, and they can learn scientific concepts that can serve them well in later science classes. This chemistry set for kids also teaches your child how to correctly use chemistry equipment, including beakers, filters, test tubes, pipettes and measuring spoons.","You can find the chemicals you need for the experiments in your home, particularly in the kitchen or laundry room. The equipment that comes with this science kit for kids is reusable, so you can repeat the experiments as much as you and your child like. You might need to buy a few extras, such as balloons for the experiments involving acids and bases that inflate the balloons, but overall, you will have what you need on hand.","Included with the kit is a 48-page manual that gives clearly written instructions for conducting chemistry experiments for kids. Your child can learn the importance of safety in a chemistry lab through such directions as making sure that everything is labeled correctly and never dumping the remaining ingredients of an experiment back into a container of the original ingredients."]},"id":"291a9690-b69e-4d42-8389-232895060646","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3aa92591-7bb4-405b-8e15-9f1079dd4866","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kids First Chemistry Set is a great choice for some fun and instructive experiments, as well as a solid introduction to the basic principles of chemistry lab safety and the methodical approach needed to conduct any experiment in a scientifically sound way.
