The average person reads approximately 200-300 words per minute, which may sound like a lot but compared to most speed readers, it is nothing.","Speed reading is the practice of reading sentences at a rapid pace. This type of reading doesn t just focus on getting through the words, but understanding what you are reading as well. There is one event, the World Championship Speed Reading Competition, which stresses comprehension while speed reading. Some of the best contestants read 1,000 to 2,000 words per minute and have at least 50 percent or higher comprehension of what they ve read. And yet, Howard Berg reads more than these contestants.","Howard Berg is considered the fastest reader in the world. &#34;The Guinness World Record Book&#34; recognized Berg in 1990 for his ability to read more than 25,000 words per minute and write more than 100 words per minute. Berg has built a career as a speed reader and sharing his knowledge with the world. He wrote two best-selling books and developed home techniques for aspiring speed-readers.","<a href=\"/best-speed-reading-software\">Speed reading</a> is something that people must train for using different techniques and skills to get quickly through the words. This is done using methods such as skimming, chunking and meta guiding.","<strong>Skimming</strong><br/>A person skims when he or she quickly reads through sentences in an effort to pick out clues to find the meaning. The problem with skimming is that there is a low comprehension, so it is not the best option for certain types of reading.","<strong>Chunking</strong><br/>Chunking involves splitting information into &#34;chunks&#34; of information so it is easier to read and understand.","<strong>Meta guiding</strong><br/>Meta guiding is when you guide your eyes using a finger or a pointer as you read. This forces your eyes to move faster along the length of the passage. You are drawing invisible shapes on the page you are reading to help broaden the visual span to help you read faster.","Some of these methods are better depending on your purpose for reading. For example, if you are studying for an exam, you will want to read fast and comprehend what it is you are reading, so chunking and meta guiding will work best.","People who are interested in learning to speed read can purchase software to teach them to do so. The available software includes 7 Speed Reading and AceReader. This software uses various exercises to teach you how to speed read. As your speed reading skills increase, you advance to the next level. Most software includes a beginner, intermediate and advanced level.","Howard Stephen Berg may be the fastest reader in the world currently, but the tips and tricks that he and speed reading software are teaching to people may result in others beating his record. Only time will tell."]},"id":"44d6274e-856e-4157-8836-8a5ad27febb8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9346","url":"/who-is-the-fastest-reader-in-the-world","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-08T23:39:24Z","datePublished":"2015-04-08T23:39:24Z","name":"Who is the Fastest Reader in the World?","synopsis":"Not only does reading a sentence take some time, but comprehending it does too.","review":{},"strapline":"Not only does reading a sentence take some time, but comprehending it does too.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-04-08T23:54:45Z","id":"hn3oExUQX7FYpuwTnjhPFm","meta":{"title":"Who is the Fastest Reader in the World?","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
