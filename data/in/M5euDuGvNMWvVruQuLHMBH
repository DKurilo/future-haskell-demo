It is great for small apartments and dormitories where space is limited. Even though it is compact compared to other espresso machines we reviewed, it has some unique of features.","The Maestria has a flip tray to accommodate taller coffee mugs. It also has a removable water tank so that you can easily fill it before each use without worrying about accidentally spilling water onto the espresso maker. The drip tray is removable for easily cleaning up drips and spills.","This cappuccino maker doesn&#39;t come with a measuring tool or a tamper. Both of these are necessary for brewing espresso from coffee beans, so you will need to purchase them separately. Tampers and measuring cups aren&#39;t hard to find and don&#39;t cost very much. Some machines in the Nespresso Maestria series comes with a cup warmer and a frothing cup.","The adjustable steam wand heats milk to a variety of textures. Depending on the consistency of the milk, you can turn your espresso into a latte, cappuccino or macchiato. The Maestria is also programmable, so you can set the espresso to begin brewing before you roll out of bed. The automatic shut-off safety feature will turn off your machine nine minutes after the Maestria is finished brewing.","The Nespresso Maestria is lacking in safety features. It doesn&#39;t have an on/off indicator so you can&#39;t know at a glance whether the machine is on and hot. It also does not have either a polarized plug or short cord, features that are especially helpful in keeping curious children safe.","Nespresso has great support options for its customers. The website is user-friendly and easy to navigate. It is easy to locate email addresses and phone numbers to contact support personal 24/7. Nespresso also has a Facebook page where you can find great recipes and additional product support from both Nespresso service reps and other Maestria users."]},"id":"1f3a55d8-f847-43ce-9008-59c48370ea7c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"758ac5e5-5316-4708-8e78-166c52e14931","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nespresso Maestria is a great, compact cappuccino maker that is programmable, so your drink is ready when you are.
