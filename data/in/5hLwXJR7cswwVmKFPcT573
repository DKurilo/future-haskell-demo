You capture images and screenshots through five options that form the acronym SWORD. The S for Screen Capture, W for Window Capture, O for Object Capture, R for Region Capture and D for Document Capture.","Each letter of the acronym is on a ribbon attached at the top of the screen while the software is running. You simply click on the letters to initiate each of the capture modes. The screenshot then appears in a window, ready to edit. It works smoothly and effectively.","In addition to the capture types mentioned above, FullShot collects images and screenshots in a scrolling capture, so you can catch more than appears on screen. This is handy for capturing webpages and spreadsheets. The time-controlled function schedules times to take automatic screenshots.","This screen capture software does not let you record video of your screen, only still shots. It&#39;s limited to standard capture shapes such as rectangles, ellipses and freehand. It does not let you capture images from multiple locations at once, like our top pick, <a href=\"/snagit-review\">Snagit</a>.","The program itself has two toolbars, one on the top of the FullShot interface and one along the side, to make editing and image manipulation easy and fast. The toolbars offer a wide range of editing and drawing functions, as well as special effects. Using these toolbars, you can crop, rotate and flip an image. In addition, you can add text and color. You can also change the color of your text.","You can add drop shadows, tear effects and frames to the screenshots you capture. In addition, you can add text bubbles or arrows and lines. You can even make them different thicknesses and colors. These elements are good for slideshows, manuals and presentations.","Many FullShot features are smooth, but some are not. When applying effects to your screen captures, such as torn edges, frames, drop shadows and glares, you first select the effect in the toolbar and then must capture the image to apply that effect. You cannot apply effects to images after you capture them.","With this screen capture software, you can create images in 16 formats including JPG, PNG, PDF and GIF. This means that you can create small files for sharing online or large high-resolution files. FullShot can import images from your connected camera or scanner, allowing you to fine tune them before sharing them.","The one big downfall of this program is price. It costs a whopping $80, when compared to our top pick at $50 and <a href=\"/ashampoo-snap-review\">best value pick</a> at $20, it’s hard to justify spending this much on a screen capture program.","FullShot Pro offers a number of useful tools, screen capture methods and additional features, making it a good choice for anyone who needs to take screenshots and edit them. This meets the standard screenshot needs to capture images, objects and webpages and to manipulate them for presentations, reports and other projects. But you’ll have to decide if all that is worth $80."]},"id":"c6ffa69d-2d82-4458-ade8-85c0abd8016a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_1054","url":"/fullshot-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
