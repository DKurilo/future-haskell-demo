Try using these natural ingredients the next time you have a nasty spill on your glass-top stove."," First, make sure the stovetop isn&#39;t hot and sprinkle baking soda generously on top of the affected area. Then moisten the baking soda with either white vinegar or lemon juice. These liquids cut naturally through grease and make your clean up easier. It is a good idea to have a spray bottle filled with these liquids on hand so you can touch up your range. Be sure to clearly label the bottle so you don&#39;t accidentally use it for the wrong application."," Leave the baking soda solution on the stained area for at least 15 minutes, more if the soiling is extremely hardened or greasy. After time is up, use a soft washcloth to wipe away the baking soda mixture until your range top is clean and shiny, spraying more white vinegar as needed to remove any remaining paste or film.","<strong>Use a Manufacturer Approved Cleaning Solution.</strong><br/>Yes, it may cost more, but many manufacturers have developed specialty cleaners that can work wonders with your stove. The main problem with using these cleaners is you will have to either order them online or have an authorized reseller nearby.","If the officially recommended cleaners are not in your price range, there are plenty of third-party cleaners available at your local supermarket. You may want to test these cleaners on a less seen part of the stovetop, just in case it has negative results such as discoloration or scratching.","<strong>Scrape it Off</strong><br/>Some food just won&#39;t come off without a little &#39;encouragement&#39;. If the above methods are unsuccessful, you may need to use a specialty scraper or razor blade to remove tough residue. While scraping food off can be effective, be extremely careful not to use the corners of a blade or an abrasive scrub pad or steel wool, as this can leave scratches on glass or metal.","Scraping in conjunction with the baking soda and vinegar treatment is an effective way to speed up the removal process. Just remember to be cautious with any sharp edges and soak the most resistant residue first to aid the removal.","A clean stovetop is a thing of joy and shows you take pride in your kitchen. Even the best ovens can be a pain to clean, so don&#39;t let stubborn messes keep you from enjoying your electric range. Take the time to give your stovetop the proper care it deserves."]},"id":"cffd368a-102d-4a13-9e72-97c1c8fac7ae","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8781","url":"/grease-busters-3-tricks-to-clean-your-electric-range","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-09-18T20:11:07Z","datePublished":"2014-09-18T20:11:07Z","name":"Grease Busters: 3 Tricks to Clean Your Electric Range","synopsis":"No matter how neatly you cook, it is nearly impossible to prevent your stovetop from being coated by bacon grease, pasta sauce spills and boil-overs while you whip up your latest culinary masterpiece.","review":{},"strapline":"No matter how neatly you cook, it is nearly impossible to prevent your stovetop from being coated by bacon grease, pasta sauce spills and boil-overs while you whip up your latest culinary masterpiece.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-09-23T15:09:14Z","id":"dzrYLMzCnFKqrSSxNQGU46","meta":{"title":"Grease Busters: 3 Tricks to Clean Your Electric Range","description":"Tired of the grease and food stuck to your stovetop?
