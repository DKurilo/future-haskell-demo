You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you&#39;re in financial hardship, drowning in debt and unable to make your minimum monthly payments, anyone who claims they can help you can seem like a knight in shining armor. In reality, most of the <a href=\"/best-debt-settlement-companies\">debt settlement</a> firms on the internet are wolves in sheep&#39;s clothing. Companies like Debt Help Plan offer a legitimate strategy to reduce your debt. Unfortunately, it often has the effect of making your financial situation worse and limiting your ability to borrow money for the foreseeable future.","The general idea behind all debt settlement plans is that the company will negotiate with your creditors for a settlement that is less than the amount you owe based upon your inability to pay the amount owed. The lynchpin of this process is the fact that your creditors must believe that you will pay them nothing if they do not accept the settlement offer.","This is accomplished by you opening a special account with Debt Help Plan and depositing money into it on a monthly basis. The amount you pay monthly is determined by how much you owe to your various creditors and an estimate of what Debt Help Now thinks they can settle the debt for.","This all sounds great for people who are behind on their payments and looking for help. The only problem is that other than taking your money, holding it for months and then offering a settlement to your creditors, the service actually does very little to help you with your money problems.","Debt Help Plan does not halt collection calls. In fact, if you are current on your payments, it&#39;s generally advised that you stop payment on unsecured debt so that the creditor will accept a settlement. This will result in your credit score, if it is not already tarnished, becoming completely devastated. And there is no guarantee or legal obligation for your creditors to accept any settlement offer nor is there any guarantee.","If Debt Help Plan cannot reach a settlement agreement with your debtors, they still have the right to keep you in collections, write you off as bad debt, damage your credit score and take you to court to claim what they are legally owed. Nothing Debt Help Plan does eliminate your obligation to pay your bills."]},"id":"fba32549-b936-4ca6-b35f-e5e77180cb4f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"89281584-179f-4c52-bf92-eb5f7e3dd27a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It&#39;s a pleasant thought for anyone facing the possibility of bankruptcy or wage garnishment to find a way out of the situation.
