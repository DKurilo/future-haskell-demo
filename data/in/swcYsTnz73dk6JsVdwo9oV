It has a 25-pound flywheel and a high gear ratio for smooth performance, and its four rear wheels ride on heavy-duty rails to provide added stability. This <a href=\"/best-elliptical-machines\">elliptical machine</a> has a 375-pound user weight maximum.","The E35’s 20-inch stride length is average, and the machine weighs 231 pounds. It has a lift handle and transport wheels to help you move it, and uses <a href=\"https://www.explainthatstuff.com/eddy-current-brakes.html\">magnetic eddy current resistance technology</a>. It also has a power incline ramp that’s adjustable from 0 to 20 incline levels. This incline targets muscle groups in your lower body for greater exercise efficiency.","The pedals on the E35 are oversized and cushioned. They have a unique design with a 2-degree inward slope to reduce ankle and knee stress, and you can adjust them to your favorite of three positions. To help you get a total body workout, the machine has moving handlebars with multi-position grips. Its stationary handlebars have pulse sensors, and it comes with a heart rate chest strap.","This elliptical machine has a cooling fan and water bottle holder, and its built-in speakers are compatible with any MP3 player. Its console is adjustable based on your preferred angle, and it has a 7.5-inch white backlit LCD display. This is similar in size to the displays of the NordicTrack and ProForm machines we reviewed, but each of those ellipticals had a touchscreen.","The E35 has 10 workout presets, which is the fewest among the elliptical machines we reviewed. These include two heart rate programs and two custom programs, and you can store two user profiles. Its console workout feedback includes time, distance traveled, calories burned and resistance. The E35 also has Bluetooth compatibility to let you transfer workout data directly from the machine to your smart device. You can either use the Sole app or transfer your data to one of four other compatible fitness apps.","The Sole E35 has one of the best warranty packages we’ve seen. It is backed by a lifetime warranty on its frame, with five years on electronics and parts and two years on labor. Sole also offers a no sales tax promotion on all orders — unless you live in California or Utah. This elliptical machine’s dimensions are 82 x 31 x 67 inches (length, width, height). Sole provides free curbside shipping for the E35 and will deliver it inside your home for $99. Professional assembly is available for $239, which is $10 cheaper than most companies. If you need help with DIY assembly or have other needs for consumer support, customer service is available by phone and email.","During our review of the best treadmills, LifeSpan Fitness taught us that manufacturers of exercise equipment often list a perpetual “sales price” for a product that is far below its official MSRP. In the cases of the Sole E35 and <a href=\"/sole-e95-review\">Sole E95</a> ellipticals, these price differences are well over $1,000.  Because their MSRPs are so high, these ellipticals both scored lower in our rankings than they would have if they weren’t priced so high by their manufacturers."]},"id":"a88c5639-277a-471a-aa2a-cadceefbd4ad","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52707","url":"/sole-e35-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-05-02T19:51:37Z","datePublished":"2011-05-02T19:51:37Z","name":"Sole E35","synopsis":"The Sole E35 has a thick steel frame and features a quiet drive system with both forward and reverse functionality.
