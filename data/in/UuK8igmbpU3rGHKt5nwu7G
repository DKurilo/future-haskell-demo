This system can reduce up to 82 contaminants from your drinking water. It uses a five-stage process to filter your water, and the filters have a lifespan of approximately six months. This drinking water filter system will fit nicely underneath your kitchen sink and comes with an included faucet. However, it does have several drawbacks, including the need for professional installation.","This water filter system can reduce up to 82 contaminants from your drinking water. These contaminants include cysts, chlorine, lead and asbestos. However, the system cannot reduce various bacteria from your drinking water, while many the best water filtration systems do offer that capability.","This system uses five stages to filter your water. It includes three pre-filters, an RO membrane and a post filter. Each stage of the water filtering process will remove different contaminants from your water, including heavy metals and chemicals. The three pre-filters on this product have a lifespan of approximately six months, while the RO membrane can last two to three years. One large drawback to this system is it doesn’t provide any type of notification system that will alert you when a filter is ready for replacement. You will need to keep track of all maintenance issues on your own.","One of the biggest drawbacks to this water filtration system is its installation. It is recommended that a plumber install this water filtration system under your kitchen sink. Still, the size of this filter isn’t large. It is only 15.75 inches wide, 5.25 inches deep and 14.25 inches tall. However, it does weigh up to 35 pounds. A lighter-weight water filter system with similar dimensions that has DIY-installation is the <a href=\"/ge-reverse-osmosis-filtration-system-review\">GE Reverse Osmosis Filtration System</a>.","There is a standard faucet included with this system, but there are no faucet options. Many similar products offer several faucet designs you can choose from in order to match your kitchen decor.","The Multipure AquaRO is covered under a one-year warranty, which is the average warranty you will find on this type of product. If you do come across any issues or have concerns regarding this system, email and telephone options are available for reaching a Multipure representative. In our experience, we were impressed with representatives from this company, especially in regards to the multiple email inquiries we sent. We always received a fast response with answers to all of our questions. However, live chat support options are not available from the company."]},"id":"0d118bff-993d-42b1-b780-eabd7330f376","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"13d530cb-3fce-48fd-b893-b21ba18c7c34","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Multipure AquaRO excels with its ability to filter numerous contaminants.
