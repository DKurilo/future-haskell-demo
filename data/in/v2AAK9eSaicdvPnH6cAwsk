Sometimes you just can&#39;t wait 24 hours for the cash, so thankfully there are San Antonio stores that let you apply in person and get the money on the same day. There are no hidden fees or other requirements to get your borrowed money immediately, so this could be a huge convenience for you.","<strong>Payday Loans in San Antonio: Read Before You Borrow</strong>","Payday loans are a tricky business that recently came under serious scrutiny by local governments. In San Antonio, lawmakers wanted to make sure residents were protected from the predatory payday loan companies that seemed to be on every city street corner. In 2012, strict restrictions were put into play for all payday loan companies, whether local or online, and this is in addition to the state and federal rules. All Credit Access Businesses, or CABs, must register with the city to receive a certificate which allows them to do business in San Antonio. Also, you cannot borrow more money than you could reasonably repay. So, limits were placed on the loan amount, per your income. That means you can only borrow up to 20 percent of your gross monthly income. Car title loans are under similar restrictions: You can only borrow up to 3 percent of your annual income, or 70 percent of the car&#39;s value, whichever figure is lower.","Here’s an example:  "]},"id":"201253a8-2714-4272-abf3-55436e5e8fc2","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["You make $34,000 annually, about $2,800 monthly","Payday advance max: $560","Title loan max: $1,020 (based on annual income)"],"type":"ul"},"id":"8e9499df-3b03-411d-b2fd-e863aff899fe","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["One of the problems with payday loans is that you can get stuck in a loop of paying off the interest and fees of a loan, but never chip away at the principal, and then you&#39;re required to do a rollover, which tacks on more fees and interest rates. San Antonio government leaders wanted to put an end to that, or at least limit it, so loans must be paid back in no more than four installments. Plus, if you renew your loan, you can only do so three times.","Perhaps one of the best requirements by the San Antonio ordinance is that the repayments must be set up in such a way that you pay down the principal by 25 percent. You need to keep in mind, though, that there are no federal, state or local laws put in place to limit CAB fees or interest rates. The companies are required to make the fee schedule clear to the borrower, but we found that some try to make a payday loan look like a better option than other financial options.","<strong>Borrower Beware: A Hard Cycle to Break</strong>","The biggest risk with payday loans is that you could easily fall into a cycle of borrowing money, repaying and then borrowing again to cover the bills that you needed the loan for. And in the end, you&#39;re paying a huge premium just for the privilege to borrow money. Not only is it a dangerous loop – it could lead to bad credit.","Payday loans with no credit check in San Antonio are easy to come by. For the most part, payday loan companies only care about your credit when you default on a loan. So, they&#39;ll report to credit agencies when you don&#39;t pay, but not when you&#39;re a faithful customer who never misses a payment. It can be frustrating, but there are some payday loan companies online that make it a point to help you build credit. It can be a double-edged sword, though, because there&#39;s a chance that a $1,000 loan hitting your credit report, along with a note that it was maxed out immediately, can look bad to some lenders.","Generally, you should not use payday loans as a long-term financial solution. It isn&#39;t a great way to build credit, and you&#39;re paying literally 30 times more in annual percentage rate (APR) with some companies than you would with a bank or credit union loan.","<strong>CAB Fee: What Is This Extra Cost?</strong>","Earlier you learned that a CAB is a Credit Access Business. You may also see CSO, which stands for Credit Services Organization. All payday loan and title loan businesses must register with San Antonio and allow the city to inspect their stores to make sure they&#39;re in accordance with the rules outlined in the ordinance.","If you study the fees and interest rates, you&#39;ll notice something labeled &#34;CAB fee,&#34; whether you take out a payday loan online or locally in San Antonio. The CAB is sort of a middleman that finds a lender that&#39;s willing to give you money. Then the CAB acquires the loan and passes it along to you. For its work, the CAB charges you a fee that&#39;s usually somewhere around $15 for every $100 you borrow, but it can be pricier. The only reason the amount stays somewhat low is competition – otherwise there is no regulation on the charge. The industry-average APR for a payday loan is about 391 percent, for a 14-day loan, which is ridiculously high anyway, but it often gets much higher.","Single-payment payday loan example:"]},"id":"c41cbebd-a931-4769-bbfe-84e670d37e16","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Loan company XYZ offers: $300","Loan length: 14 days","CAB fee: $45","Interest charge: $1.31","Total payment: $346.31","APR: 402.46%"],"type":"ul"},"id":"92cf4a5a-6e0a-4070-95c3-3a4c90781bea","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Taking out a single-payment loan over only 14 days is actually not that bad.
