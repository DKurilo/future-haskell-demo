But after entering specific details of home values and zip codes, we were able to find the right information. Chase offers 15-, 20-, and 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgages and 7/1 and 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages (the number before the slash refers to the fixed-rate term, after which the rate is adjustable annually). In the jumbo category, borrowers can get up to $1 million for investment properties and $3 million for primary homes. There’s also an interest-only jumbo mortgage for borrowers with qualifying credit profiles.","In addition to FHA and VA loans, Chase has its own DreaMaker program for homebuyers with less cash or lower credit scores. Through the program, you can put as little as 3 percent down (if your credit score is 680 or above; 5 percent if it’s 620 to 689), and they may be eligible for a $2,500 grant to use toward closing costs, discount points or a down payment. You can get another $500 for completing a homebuyer education course. The bank’s private mortgage insurance costs are also lower through this program.","Chase’s conventional refinancing options are the same as its purchase mortgages, and it offers home equity lines of credit and cash-out home equity loans, too.","<strong>Rates and Fees</strong>","Chase does not openly advertise its rates until you enter a home value and zip code, and even then, those rates are calculated with discount points, so they’re difficult to compare with other lenders’ rates. Chase’s rates did appear to be slightly higher than those of other large lenders, such as <a href=\"/wells-fargo-home-mortgage-review\">Wells Fargo</a>, but the difference between its interest rates and annual percentage rate was minimal, indicating lower fees. An online calculator shows you the fees you might be charged for your loan. Instead of an origination fee, the estimate lists a “processing/underwriting fee.”","Many mortgage hunters who choose a large bank like Chase do so because they already use, and like, one of its other products. One advertised benefit for Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card holders is their potential eligibility to earn 75,000 Ultimate Rewards points when they open a mortgage with the bank.","<strong>Customer Experience</strong>","If you live in one of the 22 states with Chase branches, visiting one in person might be the best way to get a complete picture of the bank’s loan offers. Of course, the phone works for that, too. If you’re hoping to get all your information online, however, lenders such as <a href=\"/money/loans/best-mortgage-and-refinance-lenders/rocket-mortgage-by-quicken-loans-review/\">Quicken/Rocket</a> or <a href=\"/sofi-review\">SoFi</a> are a better bet.","Chase ranks slightly above average in customer satisfaction on J.D. Power’s 2017 survey. As one of the largest lenders in the country, Chase is the target of a fair number of complaints on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau database but not a very high percentage relative to its loan volume, and most have to do with the loan modification process. As is the case with other lenders, your experience will depend in large part on the individual handling the loan."]},"id":"8dfb071a-71a0-498a-bbd9-dce3b986dbb2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_48666","url":"/chase-mortgage-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sabrina-rojas-weiss","url":"/author/sabrina-rojas-weiss","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Sabrina Rojas Weiss","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"tVZv6ejiouijuHU3n7n49Y","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-01-31T21:02:18Z","datePublished":"2010-01-31T21:02:18Z","name":"Chase","synopsis":"If you’re looking online, don’t expect to find a list of all the mortgages and home loans available from Chase; that page was “not found” at the time of this publishing.","review":{"rating":35,"pros":["Chase charges lower closing costs than its rivals.
