You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Kenmore Elite comes in a two-slice and <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-toasters/\">four-slice toaster</a> variety. It has extra-long and extra-wide slots that are great. The extra-wide and long slot design allows for more toasting options. For example, artisan breads can be very tricky to toast as they hardly ever come pre-sliced, but the Kenmore Elite allows you to cut thick slices of bread and still toast them evenly.","The digital display lets you know the exact shade setting you are using during the toasting cycle. This means you’ll be able to get consistent and precise browning on different types of bread. There are nine preset shade settings. You are limited to the preset nine. This means if you want your toast just a little lighter than one of the settings, you’ll have to watch carefully and manually hit the cancel button.","The aesthetic design of the Kenmore Elite is not up to par with the rest of the toaster&#39;s features. The plastic casing doesn&#39;t provide a great heat shielding, and it detracts from the nice stainless steel cross section on the toaster. There is no hideaway cord feature that stores the cord out of sight when it’s not in use. This means you’ll likely end up using more counter space and storage space for the toaster.","The Kenmore Elite has an amazing warranty. If the product fails due to a defect in material or workmanship in the first five years, you can return it to a Sears store or other Kenmore outlet for a free replacement. A normal warranty for a toaster is usually about a year, and they are generally very limited in scope. The ability to return this toaster to a local store is a real benefit. Kenmore also provides live chat support for its products through Sears, and there is an email form on the website where you can submit questions. Kenmore does not provide digital copies of its user manuals online."]},"id":"d3fede18-a6b8-4769-9f38-82a2bc0fa8dc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c02a7bf5-8ad6-47f2-9527-57d35a4f3ee5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore Elite has a great warranty and support for a small appliance.
