Traditional power sources heat the air, surface of the stove and can be inefficient with their energy. Induction uses a low-voltage electric current to produce a magnetic field around your cookware. The electric current in the pot produces resistive heating to heat the food while keeping the surface cooler.","This efficient method of cooking boosts cooking times and safety to minimize surface burns if you accidentally touch the cooktop. The power assist function boils water in 90 seconds and responds to temperature changes more quickly than electric or natural gas power.","The Electrolux induction range has expandable elements ranging from 6 to 10 inches. If a standard refrigerator magnet can stick to your cookware, it is compatible with this slide-in range. The heat focuses on the surface of the pot or pan and only heats that concentrated section. The flat glass surface keeps your food stable while cooking and makes it easy to slide from one burner area to another. Controls for this induction range are touch oriented. Simply touch the main control panel to activate. After you make adjustments or turn on the oven or stove, the panel returns to its sleek, blank sleep mode. You can activate this at any time for adjustments and deactivation.","The two-chambered oven below the stove holds 4.2 cubic feet for large meals and includes a smaller lower oven for pastries, breads and other baking. The Electrolux induction range has many cooking methods available for convection and non-convection baking, roasting and broiling. The non-convection modes include standard bake, broil, keep warm, slow cook and Sabbath Mode. Whether you use the feature or not, the automatic convection conversion option makes it easier to cook. Convection uses a fan in the back of the oven to circulate the already hot air in the oven chamber. This keeps your food consistently warm all over without cold pockets or uneven baking. You can bookmark your favorite settings for your most frequent dishes to make the cooking process go a little more smoothly.","The three levels of self-cleaning features use pyrolytic technology to char and burn food messes inside the oven with temperatures up to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The Electrolux 30-inch induction range is ADA compliant if you or any of your family have disabilities and comes with a one-year parts and labor warranty.","The stylish and modern look of the Electrolux induction range combines beauty and science to help you prepare your favorite meals quickly, safely and more efficiently. Induction cooking uses magnetism to heat your cookware instead of hot coils or flames that could cause a potential safety risk. From its cobalt blue interior to the sleek induction stove top, this Electrolux model really has magnetism."]},"id":"95cb395c-6898-4cf5-bddc-29b78a22f2c0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58004","url":"/electrolux-slide-in-range-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T12:56:20Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T12:56:20Z","name":"Electrolux EW30IS65J","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued, has been replaced by another product.
