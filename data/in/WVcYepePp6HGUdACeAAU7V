You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Piper nv Pro is the only all-in-one <a href=\"/best-diy-home-security\">DIY home security system</a> we tested – its hub is also a security camera and motion detector. The Piper nv Pro Bundle lets you choose a combination of three accessories; we tested a door and window sensor, a Z-Wave lightbulb, and a smart outlet. This Piper nv DIY security system starter kit also works as a home automation system.","Installation is fairly simple because the Piper nv is the definition of plug and play. We set the <a href=\"/best-home-security-systems\">home security system</a> up through a wireless connection, so we didn&#39;t even need to plug the hub into a router. Although it&#39;s an easy-to-use system, the Piper nv doesn&#39;t have as many helpful features or devices as other systems we tested. It doesn’t come with key fobs or RFID tags, so you have to use your mobile device to arm and disarm the system. You also have to set up how Piper should react if motion is detected, the temperature changes, the door or window sensors are triggered, or there is a loud sound.","Piper nv coordinates with the Z-Wave home automation platform and connects with smart devices such as smart plugs, pet immune motion detectors and smart code door locks. There aren&#39;t many home security devices to choose from compared to other systems we tested. The company also doesn’t offer professional monitoring. The security camera records footage that is then stored on the cloud, and you can review the video there.","The built-in alarm was the loudest of all the systems we tested, even compared to the best DIY home security systems. The siren registered at 105 decibels at 3 feet away, which is the equivalent of a loud sporting event or a lawn mower. At 20 feet, the alarm registered at 90 decibels.","If you need help from customer service or tech support, the company&#39;s support team is more available than any other DIY home security system we reviewed. You can contact the support team by phone, email or live chat weekdays and weekends from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. EST."]},"id":"2e333fa7-b910-46fa-9438-6da3e5541d35","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fba64dc9-b8ba-4d02-a104-bf67b69e5a7d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Piper nv is a convenient choice for DIY home security because it&#39;s an all-in-one system, and you don&#39;t have to add many devices to make it work for you.
