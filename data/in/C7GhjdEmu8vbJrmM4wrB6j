GXT1000VP4 is a great walkie talkie that has good range over GMRS frequencies and offers access to NOAA weather alerts. It also features an SOS siren.","The GXT offers 50 channels, the most of any of the <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-walkie-talkies\">walkie talkies</a> we tested. However, be aware that if you want to make use of the extra channels, you’ll have to communicate using GXT radios because most other walkie talkies don’t offer channels beyond the regular 22. On the 50 channels available, you can access both FRS and GMRS frequencies. FRS frequencies have shorter ranges, but they are open for anyone to use. GMRS gives you additional range, but it requires a license through the FCC.","In our walkie talkie tests for range, the GXT tied for the highest score on the high-power GMRS frequency. However, on the lower-power FRS frequency, the GXT performed much worse. We found call clarity and accuracy to be exceptional up to a range of 1 mile on both high- and low-power channels, but in increasing that distance to 1.5 miles, we saw a significant decrease in the amount of our test message that got through on the FRS frequency.","Midland’s GXT two-way radio has several emergency features that make it useful. The walkie talkie has access to NOAA weather alerts and automatically scans local channels. It even sends you an alert for severe weather. If you get stuck, lost or hurt and need help, you can press and hold a button on the unit, and the SOS siren sends a loud distress signal.","This is a durable outdoor walkie talkie, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bulky or cumbersome. The GXT is about average when it comes to weight. Additionally, it comes with a variety of accessories, including multiple charging methods and headsets.","The GXT isn’t as waterproof as other models we tested. While other units in this category boast full IPX7 waterproofing, the GXT is only rated at JIS4. The JIS system is an IPX equivalent, and the JIS4 rating means the GXT is only water resistant, not fully submersible.","The belt clip on the GXT is an adjustable, alligator-style clip, which means that it’s easy to attach to the straps of a backpack or to the front of a vest or jacket if you’re outside working.","The GXT comes with a rechargeable battery and a charging pack. There is a battery meter with a low-battery indicator. If you are stuck in the woods and unable to charge your radio, you can use four AA batteries.","The only thing missing from this walkie talkie radio is an effective noise-canceling feature. Many walkie talkies include an auto squelch function, which gives audio priority to voices and mutes all ambient noise, but the GXT lacks this feature. If you are in a noisy environment, people listening to your transmissions may get a lot of background noise.","Midland walkie talkie sets come with a three-year warranty – a great warranty for a device that is going to take some falls and the longest warranty length of any of the units we reviewed. From the product page on the website, you can access the full user manual, a FAQs section, warranty information and the contact page."]},"id":"1cbf9a7a-207d-4181-8351-911f43dfe56b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c35ca875-879d-4680-bfcb-f2eb9ccd3237","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Midland GXT1000VP4 is a top walkie talkie, thanks to its durable design, many features and excellent support options.
