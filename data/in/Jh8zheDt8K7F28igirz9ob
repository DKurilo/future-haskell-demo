Both the cherry wood and black veneer finishes provide great visual impressions. These speakers stand tall and provide a ported enclosure with one 7-inch woofer, one 6-inch driver for the midrange frequencies, and a 1-inch silk and polymer dynamic-balance dome for high frequencies.","The dynamic sound spectrum for these speakers is crystal clear â€“ so clear that the high frequencies tend to sound too sharp and abrasive. Hi-hats and cymbal sounds from a drum kit seem to cut right through to the front, becoming overbearing at times when rock and electronic genres are on display. These speakers excel at representing jazz and classical music, two genres where high and midrange tones are prominent.","The midrange tones and low-register sounds are solid, warm and punchy. The dual-ported enclosure gives these speakers plenty of air to breathe and rounds out the sound of the bass without being too thumpy. Give these speakers enough room away from walls for the rear port to push air. Giving these speakers room to breathe will provide the best sound possible. If these speakers didn&#39;t have such an overpowering high register, they could run for the best floor standing speakers on the market today.","These tower speakers have a low sensitivity rating of 89dB. In order for these speakers to flourish, you need to push them with more power than most speakers we reviewed require. You&#39;ll need a much more powerful amplifier when using these stereo speakers. An underperforming amplifier coupled with the Polk RTiA7 could result in both damaged speakers and a blown amplifier.","These speakers are some of the tallest and heaviest speakers that we reviewed. Each speaker weighs 55 pounds and is 42.25 inches tall. The real wood veneers give these speakers the classic look characteristic of the Polk brand. These speakers are covered by a five-year warranty."]},"id":"ff680d77-2d65-490b-8e28-873ffc524472","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2ad4205e-bbf8-4d9c-a70a-d88453c79b01","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Polk RTiA7&#39;s overall sound doesn&#39;t match its exterior beauty. The dynamic range of the speaker sizes does cover all frequency ranges well, but the high overtones can be too much to handle, coming off as abrasive at times.
