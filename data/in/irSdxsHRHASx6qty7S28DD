Clicking the Buy button will take you to this version for purchase. We will evaluate, rank and review the new version when we next update the Mac Photo Editing Software reviews. Meanwhile, enjoy our review below about Pixelmator 3.3.<br/></em>","The <a href=\"/best-mac-photo-editing-software\">Mac photo editing software</a> Pixelmator is a full-featured software offered at an affordable price. The software includes a wide selection of basic and advanced editing tools, sharing capabilities and file compatibility.","You&#39;ll only be able to purchase this software directly from the company so there is no Amazon buying option. It sells for roughly $30, which makes it one of the least expensive programs we tested. To get a better feel for the program, check out the 30-day free trial period.","Pixelmator comes with a wide variety of editing tools, all available on the program’s clean interface. The software features a black workspace you can customize by moving around floating windows.","This Mac photo editor serves as a good option for beginners. In addition to being very usable, the software has all the basic tools you need to successfully edit your photos. You can crop, zoom, resize, select, paint and draw. You also can adjust the colors in your photos.","Pixelmator uses layers, so you can make changes to your photos without permanently altering the original. You also can use layer masks to hide unwanted objects without erasing parts of your image, or you can use the cloning tool. While they alter your photo, the layers protect your original image.","You also can use the healing tool to remove objects from your images or fix blemishes on your subjects’ faces. The content-aware fill tool can be used in this process to intuitively fill in the removed spots based on samples taken from the surrounding area.","In addition to this software’s advanced capabilities, the program includes several tools to help you perfect your images. You can apply one of the 126 creative filters to add texture or adjust the color of your photo. You also can use the color management tools or highlight and shadow adjustments to change your picture’s appearance.","While this photo editor for Mac offers a variety of both standard and professional tools, it lacks some capabilities. This application cannot create HDR images or panoramic photos. It also does not have a lens distortion corrector, which can be helpful when working with images taken on digital cameras. If you&#39;d like your photo editing software to have these features, you&#39;ll be interested in <a href=\"/corel-aftershot-pro-review\">Corel AfterShot Pro</a>.","Like several of the Mac picture editors on our lineup, Pixelmator does not have a built-in photo organizer. Instead, it relies on Apple’s Photos app to organize and manage your images. If you use your Mac’s built-in photo organizer to manage your photos, you need to relaunch Pixelmator in order to see any changes.","While the software does not have a photo organizer, it does have a photo browser that allows you to browse, preview and search for images to edit. When you use Pixelmator’s photo browser, it automatically pulls photos, albums and libraries from Photos. You can view the image files whether Photos is open or not.","Pixelmator supports a wide variety of file formats, including popular image files like RAW, JPG, TIFF, PNG, GIF, PSD and even PDF. You can also optimize your photos for online content by using the Export for Web feature, which resizes your file to allow for quick page load times.","This Mac photo editor makes it easy to share your photos with friends and family. You can post individual photos or entire albums to social media sites like Facebook and Flickr. You also can send your edited photos in an email directly from the application.","Pixelmator offers extensive technical support options. You can access video tutorials, FAQs and a user forum directly from its website. You also can access links to third-party tutorials that help you learn how to perform certain edits. If you still need help, Pixelmator lists a technical support email on its website. We found that Pixelmator always responded quickly to our inquiries with useful information.","Not only does Pixelmator offer an extensive list of photo editing tools, but it also is easy to use and a good program to learn on. While the photo editor does lack an organizer, the photo browser is compatible with the photo manager that comes preinstalled on Macs. Between the advanced capabilities, ease of use and support options, Pixelmator serves as a good option to beginner and professional photographers alike."]},"id":"9a85011f-fbf6-4cf4-a367-936afd425c7b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49603","url":"/pixelmator-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-05-23T19:10:46Z","datePublished":"2010-05-23T19:10:46Z","name":"Pixelmator 3.3","synopsis":"Editor's Note: Pixelmator 3.8 is now available.
