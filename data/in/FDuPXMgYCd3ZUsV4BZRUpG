You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Grundig FR250 <a href=\"/best-crank-radios\">crank radio</a> won&#39;t fit in your pocket but it will give you reliable features that could serve you well in an emergency. The FR250 has access to AM/FM radio stations, and you can access shortwave radio as well. And with a powerful LED flashlight, it will give you visual as well as audio help during an emergency.","The crank on this emergency radio will give you 90 minutes of run time for about 2 minutes of cranking. Fully charged, this device will last almost 12 hours if you use it on low volume. The bulky design, which is almost 7 inches tall by 6 inches wide, does allow for longer listening times but makes it harder to carry around.","The flashlight is very powerful. The LED lights allow for viewing of up to 25 feet during the darkest hours of the night. It&#39;s not quite powerful enough to turn vampires away, but you don&#39;t have to worry about where you are stepping when it is on. The FR250 does have access to AM/FM and shortwave radio stations. While shortwave radio can give you decent weather reports, it&#39;s more of a hobby and the reports may not be accurate. The NOAA stations that most other emergency radios have can provide much more thorough reports.","Some other useful features you can find with the Grundig FR250 are a headphone jack, a cell phone charger and the largest speaker we saw in our comparison of emergency radios.","The main overall purpose of a crank radio is to serve you in time of emergency, especially outdoors. The FR250 is convenient for outdoor occasions since you can get weather updates through it but it is a device that isn&#39;t built for the rugged outdoors. You will have to keep it hidden from water as it is not splash or waterproof. There also isn&#39;t a special rubber casing on the outside to keep it from getting dinged up.","Charging this unit is standard. You can crank the handle or plug it in using a 12V AC jack. This has one of the largest running times when fully charged (12 hours), but unfortunately you cannot charge it through a solar panel because there isn&#39;t one. There are slots for three AAA batteries as well, which will give you even more playing time. The warranty on this product is one year, and you can get technical help via phone or email. We recommend getting questions answered by phone, since emails tend to take a couple of days."]},"id":"256af3c1-c818-4a7a-8aaf-f276f6424b64","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"05d1a981-cab3-469a-9971-5c9b153babf6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Between the bright LED flashlight and long playing time you get with this device when fully charged, the Grundig FR250 can be an effective tool for anyone going camping, hiking, caught without power or just seeking the enjoyment in the backyard.
