You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Our testers noted that while some of the images displayed well enough on the TENKER <a href=\"/best-digital-photo-frames\">digital photo frame</a> screen, others appeared super pixelated. The color quality was decent but the blurriness distracted from the images themselves. This digital photo frame is very basic as it doesn&#39;t have Wi-Fi connectivity or any additional features. All in all, this device is a great pick for anyone looking for a basic and low-cost photo frame.","TENKER sells this frame for roughly $50, which makes it the least expensive device that we tested. It also happens to be the smallest device we tested. It has a display resolution of 1024 x 768 and an aspect ratio of (16:19), which is preferred for video watching. This device is compatible with MP3 and MP4 files so you can easily upload your favorite music or videos taken from your phone. While using the TENKER, we noticed a delay when responding to the remote, which can be a little annoying. Pulling up a menu or selecting a specific photo to view takes some time and results in a loading screen for a few seconds. When browsing your image files, it takes a while for the thumbnails to load, which is frustrating if you&#39;re looking for a specific photo. If you want a frame that responds faster, you should look at the <a href=\"/nix-advance-review\">NIX Advance</a>.","You can display both portrait and landscape photos but the unit doesn&#39;t have an internal gyroscope so it won&#39;t rotate your photos based on the vertical or horizontal position of the frame. Additionally, the stand only allows you to position the frame landscape-wise and there isn&#39;t a way to mount it on the wall so it must be placed on flat surface. Since there is no Wi-Fi connectivity or Bluetooth, you cannot download images from social media sites or the internet in general. All your files must be placed on a USB thumb drive or SD card and inserted in the back of the frame. There is no internal storage, so you cannot upload images directly to the frame using your computer.","As far as ease of use goes, our testers said that while the interface was relatively easy to figure out, the remote had too many buttons making it overly complicated. There is a music menu, video menu and photo menu so you can select the media you want to use. You can also have music play in the background while the slideshow plays. The calendar feature displays the date and time along with a smaller slideshow.","There is no touchscreen, so you will need to rely on the remote or the physical buttons on the backside of the device to control it. The longest display time for any given image is only 15 minutes, which is pretty short. It is best when the display interval can last for an hour or more. Some even allow you to show an image for up to 24 hours, which is nice for when you want to focus on one image for events like a birthday, wedding or funeral. This device offers 10 different transitions to choose from and is covered by a one-year warranty. Should you need to contact the company, you can do so via phone or email.","The TENKER 7 inch is a small, affordable and simple digital photo frame that doesn&#39;t include a lot of extras. You can use it to play your favorite music, watch family videos or view a photo slideshow. It cannot connect to the internet and doesn&#39;t have any internal storage so you must purchase a USB or SD card in order to view images."]},"id":"8be65ab5-a522-4307-8df5-b06767528604","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70064","url":"/tenker-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-07-02T21:05:05Z","datePublished":"2018-07-02T21:05:05Z","name":"TENKER 7-inch","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":78,"verdict":"This simple photo frame is a great pick for anyone on a budget, but it doesn&#039;t have the best photo quality and it lacks some convenience features.","pros":["This is the least expensive device we tested."],"cons":["Depending on their resolution, some of the images will display pixelated."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-25T00:00:00Z","id":"HQxQPJdf8rUB8WjBY38wKQ","meta":{"title":"TENKER Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
