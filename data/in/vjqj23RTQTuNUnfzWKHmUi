While this is a welcome addition to this new market, their <strong>WildCharge Pad</strong> wireless phone charger doesn’t add anything to the basic contact-point wireless charger model. It offers comparable features and output capabilities, but it lacks the compatibility of the other devices in our comparison. The only surprising part about this device was its customer service, being such a new and relatively unknown manufacturer.","Pure Energy Solutions prides themselves on being a “green energy company.” They’ve established their company in this area by providing eco-friendly rechargeable batteries and wire-free charging platforms, like the WildCharge Pad. Their technologies are based on clean, economically friendly principles that have earned them the backing of several environmental groups, including Energy Star ratings and an EcoLogo environmental mark. Despite its prestigious awards in energy efficiency, the wireless charger does not compare well against the current competition; with some improvements to compatibility and an internal battery or full-charge shutoff, this device could rank higher in our comparison."]},"id":"ffed8a79-635b-43a2-a8f0-7cab027cea0b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Specifications"},"id":"e6c6d5c9-68b1-494a-bafd-6ef3246d52f9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The iPhone 3G/3GS, the iPod Touch, and the BlackBerry Curve, Bold and Pearl are the only devices that have sleeves and cases compatible with this wireless charger. Other devices can be charged with the WildCharge Pad, but universal adapters (like their PowerDisc) are required for drop-and-charge functionality. We were disappointed to find that this wireless charger also required the consumer, if using a universal power clip, to glue the clip to the back of the device. We see how this is necessary, as this wireless charger does not use the inductive transfer technology, but it is still irritating and inconvenient. A wider selection of sleeves and cases, or at least a clip that doesn’t require permanent attachment, could help this device perform better in this category."]},"id":"3d95b401-3bb6-445d-8bbf-91894bbb354c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"8ad7406a-535d-4649-bf66-a5eed5e74a9c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The WildCharge Pad provides 15 watts of output power: enough to charge multiple devices simultaneously. It works through the traditional contact-point transference principle, where two conductive materials transfer electricity to charge the battery. What this means for you is that you will have to be sure that the contact points on the case or clip are making unimpeded contact with the wireless charger at all times. If your device is unbalanced and tips over slightly, you may find yourself with a spent battery before midday. The adaptation of inductive technology (which would require total re-engineering), the addition of an internal battery or a full-charge shutoff feature would help this device rank much higher in our lineup."]},"id":"3c4f3894-a80c-4dae-83d4-72df1b8d6969","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"f20460ac-bb8a-4314-9625-aafa859fdec4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The WildCharge Pad is somewhat thin and almost feels flimsy.
