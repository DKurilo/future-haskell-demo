The Valentine Roses bouquet we ordered arrived the day we expected it in a box with a red glass vase. The bouquet included 12 red roses, baby’s breath and some extra greenery, which filled out the vase nicely. They arrived with a straw bow tied around the stems so we could have unboxed them and easily taken them in person to an event or on a date. Instead, we followed the instructions and snipped about an inch or two off the bottom of the stems before putting them in water and adding the plant food that came with the arrangement.","The roses then took four days to fully unfurl, which was somewhat longer than prearranged bouquets that usually took about one day. Our reviewers gave it a mid-range score on overall appearance and smell, very similar to the bouquet from <a href=\"/1800flowers-review\">1-800-Flowers.com</a>. They then lasted eight days in the vase before wilting completely.","Flora2000 doesn’t offer anything in the way of bouquet customization whereas other sites like <a href=\"/flower-com-review\">Flower.com</a> and <a href=\"/proflowers-review\">ProFlowers</a> do. There aren’t any options to alter or upgrade arrangements, and because they box their flowers rather than outsource them to a local florist, what you see online is what you’re going to get. A wide range of flowers and bouquets are available, though, from exotic orchids and birds of paradise to a rainbow of different carnations and roses. The website is easy to use and has a “search by price” function, which we found convenient. An arrangement’s “total price” including shipping and handling is listed next to every item as well, a rarity among <a href=\"/best-online-flower-delivery-services\">online flower delivery services</a> that all tend to hide shipping costs until checkout.","Flora2000 didn&#39;t send us a confirmation email when the flowers arrived and we couldn&#39;t find any online order tracking option, so you&#39;re going to be in the dark about when exactly they get to their destination. The company does, however, offer email and phone assistance if you want to find out the status of your order.","If you want to add a little something to your flowers, you can select bouquets accompanied by stuffed animals. You could even search their selection of sweets, such as the 2-pound chocolate mousse torte cake, if you want to go above and beyond."]},"id":"ed6adc6f-f248-49a1-8567-e16e70cc62fd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3302","url":"/flora2000-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-06-29T19:38:07Z","datePublished":"2009-06-29T19:38:07Z","name":"Flora2000","synopsis":"Flora2000’s website tagline says they are “always on time” and they did not disappoint.","review":{"rating":55,"verdict":"The arrangement we got from Flora2000 received high marks from our reviewers, but the website&#8217;s lack of customizable arrangements and other extras lowered it on our lineup.","pros":["They ship to 190 countries around the world."],"cons":["They don&#8217;t offer online order tracking or send a delivery confirmation email."]},"strapline":"Flora2000’s website tagline says they are “always on time” and they did not disappoint.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-02-23T00:00:00Z","id":"QiFzftKcB4ceWEZYKqbGoL","meta":{"title":"Flora2000 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The arrangement we got from Flora2000 received high marks from our reviewers, but the website&#8217;s lack of customizable arrangements and other extras lowered it on our lineup."},"products":[{"slug":"flora2000","url":"/product/flora2000","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:08:35Z","name":"Flora2000","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:08:35Z","id":"CetChkyFzdCWLPZoFPMuzJ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:08:35Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/vtsRHxVmhEUAVWXUfMwjYi.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:08:35Z","mimeType":"","name":"9e51352f6ee3e643743c766880e37501.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/9e51352f6ee3e643743c766880e37501.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:08:35Z","id":"vtsRHxVmhEUAVWXUfMwjYi","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vtsRHxVmhEUAVWXUfMwjYi.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Flora2000 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The arrangement we got from Flora2000 received high marks from our reviewers, but the website&#8217;s lack of customizable arrangements and other extras lowered it on our lineup."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/vtsRHxVmhEUAVWXUfMwjYi.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:08:35Z","mimeType":"","name":"9e51352f6ee3e643743c766880e37501.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/9e51352f6ee3e643743c766880e37501.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:08:35Z","id":"vtsRHxVmhEUAVWXUfMwjYi","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vtsRHxVmhEUAVWXUfMwjYi.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Flora2000 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The arrangement we got from Flora2000 received high marks from our reviewers, but the website&#8217;s lack of customizable arrangements and other extras lowered it on our lineup."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/gifts/seasonal/best-online-flower-delivery-services/flora2000-review/","label":"","tags":[]}
