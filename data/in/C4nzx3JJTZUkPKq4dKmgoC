This rear-facing <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> increases the weight limit and adds an anti-rebound bar to the base to offer better protection in the event of front and rear collisions. It is compatible with any Peg Perego stroller, thanks to its G-Matic System, and it can recline to multiple angles to offer the most comfort and safety for your baby. However, the cushions are not machine washable, and the Italian-made upholstery is not practical for some families. If you want a car seat with machine washable cushions, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/chicco-keyfit-30-review\">Chicco KeyFit 30</a>.","The car seat meets all federal safety and crash-testing requirements. The base includes an anti-rebound bar to reduce the force of a front or rear collision. You cannot adjust this bar, so it might not fit correctly in all vehicles. The energy-absorbing foam and head support offer side-impact protection. The car seat is also FAA-certified for airplane usage.","This infant car seat uses an infant cushion insert for children as light as 4 pounds. The seat can support a child up to 35 pounds or 32 inches, more than the average infant car seat can support. The car seat should be able to stay with your child through the first year to year and a half of life.","Although this company makes beautifully designed baby car seats, the practical usage is limited by the fact that it is not machine washable. On top of that, there isn&#39;t much space between the carry handle and the canopy, so it is uncomfortable to use both at the same time.","The car seat is compatible with any Peg Perego stroller without the need for extra adapters. The base includes LATCH connectors for easy installation, and you can install the seat without its base, although you lose the anti-rebound bar. Peg Perego supports the car seat with a two-year warranty, and if you need extra help, customer support is available by email and telephone."]},"id":"38989dbd-d4ae-4cf3-8e92-6579f57a1691","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"90805d75-0f35-4f5b-bad2-776753586360","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Peg Perego Primo Viaggio 4-35 is a beautiful rear-facing baby car seat with some excellent safety features, like the anti-rebound bar on the base, which offers better protection in the event of front and rear collisions.
