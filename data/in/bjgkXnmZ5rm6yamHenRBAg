It&#39;s bigger than the average smartphone, but it&#39;s still small enough to fit comfortably in most hands. The rounded edges feel good in the palm and make it seem slimmer than it is. That said, the design is quite pedestrian, with nothing about it that really makes the phone stand out. In fact, you could easy mistake it for the <a href=\"/samsung-galaxy-s8-review\">Samsung Galaxy S8</a>.","Its 6.01-inch display is one of the biggest available and nearly covers the entire phone, though it&#39;s not quite an edge-to-edge display – there is about a quarter inch of display-less phone on the top and bottom. While the space at the top houses the front-facing camera and a small speaker, the space at the bottom seems like it&#39;s there simply for symmetry.","The 5T comes with Android 7.1.1, which is the latest version of the popular operating system. The biggest advantage of this OS over the iPhone&#39;s OS is the control you have over practically everything. The iPhone&#39;s OS may be more user-friendly, but this Android OS is ideal for users who want to heavily customize their smartphone. Of course, such customization comes with its own learning curves.
