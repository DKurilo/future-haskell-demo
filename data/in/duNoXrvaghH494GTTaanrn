We found a few options for small vehicles, including the Combi Coccoro. This compact <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> will secure a premature baby as light as 3 pounds as a rear-facing seat and convert to a front-facing seat for toddlers ranging from 20 to 40 pounds. Unfortunately, it lacks many of the convenience features that we look for.","The Coccoro is safety tested to meet all federal requirements. The seat has energy-absorbent foam and offers side-impact protection. The five-point harness will keep your baby secure in an accident.","As a rear-facing car seat, the Coccoro is rated for children as small as 3 pounds and as heavy as 33 pounds. After that, you can turn the seat around to secure children from 20 to 40 pounds. Unfortunately, the 40-pound maximum weight limit is lower than many other convertible car seats.","Like all convertible car seats, the Combi Coccoro will stay in your car throughout its life, so it is not compatible with any strollers. It does not have an adjustable carry handle or canopy. Fortunately, it does offer machine-washable cushions. It also has an adjustable harness, but you&#39;ll have to take the seat apart to rethread the shoulder straps. The seat does not include a cup holder, although this feature would increase the size of the seat itself.","Combi offers a one-year warranty on the Coccoro. You can reach customer support by phone or email, and we found the support representatives to be very responsive and helpful. Unfortunately, the Combi website does not have a local retailer finder. If you need a new user manual, you can download it from the website."]},"id":"f9a84cf1-f151-43c1-bfcc-051d52ad82a5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4c6c63e3-0de7-489f-b5b6-0a8df54f874a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Combi Coccoro is a compact baby car seat with all the safety features we look for.
