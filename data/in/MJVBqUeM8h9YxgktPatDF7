You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Sharp has gained its reputation as one of the best TV brands by delivering quality TVs with huge screens. The Sharp Aquos Q series is no exception. The Sharp Aquos Q is one of the best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TVs</a> because it includes Quattron technology, which produces a vivid picture.","Most TV screens feature three color subpixels: red, green and blue. One of Sharp’s main selling points is Quattron technology that adds another color to the spectrum: yellow. In side-by-side testing, the Sharp picture looks vivid and brilliant. Color accuracy is high and scenes don’t look washed out.","Sharp Aquos Q also features a 240Hz refresh rate. Live action scenes with plenty of movement are shown without any artifacts, and there is little to no motion blur in most cases. This TV is not only great for blockbuster movies and sports, but with the powerful display, gamers will enjoy high-def gaming as well. For the big screen experience, Sharp offers the Aquos Q in 60 and 70-inch sizes. There aren&#39;t any smaller sizes of the Q series.  Many other competitors have on average seven to eight sizes of screens.","Cutting the cord is a growing trend as so many shows are available for video streaming online. You could stream shows and movies using a peripheral device like the Roku, Apple TV, Google Chromecast or Amazon Fire Stick. This Sharp Aquos TV, like many of its top competitors, is a smart TV, which eliminates the need for extra equipment to connect to the internet. The TV gives you access to video streaming apps like Netflix and Hulu Plus. You can also watch YouTube, surf the web and stay connected with friends through the included Facebook app. You can connect this TV wirelessly or through an Ethernet cable to access Sharp’s Smartcentral 3.0 hub.","There are four HDMI ports, which is plenty to connect a Blu-ray player, satellite or cable box, and a gaming console or two. However, if you have a large library of 3D content, you will need to look for another TV as this one doesn&#39;t support 3D viewing."]},"id":"f44845a0-ab49-4ddb-814f-9e4cb5613a24","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c8f3c3be-0110-4832-9c2e-a48ebbac5aa2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sharp brand is highly regarded, and the Aquos Q series has a strong display with a high refresh rate and beautiful colors.
