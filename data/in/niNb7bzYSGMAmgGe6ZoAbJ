You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The GE FUF21SVRWW is a standard <a href=\"/best-freezers\">upright freezer</a> with a large capacity and sensitive temperature monitors for safe and convenient food storage. If you are looking for a place to keep large amounts meat or other bulk purchases, this upright freezer would be a good solution.","Probably the biggest complaint we have with the GE FUF21SVRWW is that it isn’t Energy Star qualified, which means it is definitely not energy efficient. This explains the fact that while most upright freezers cost approximately $70 to operate per year, this model has an estimated $82 yearly operating cost. As for storage, however, it has a fairly good capacity of 20.5 cubic feet and 23.4 square feet in shelf area. It has one bottom basket that slides out, four interior shelves and six door bins. An interior light is built in for convenience. Once filled with tasty frozen items, you’ll want to keep unwanted fingers from sneaking ice cream and other items by taking advantage of the integrated lock.","To prevent spoiled food, a temperature monitor and power on light are conveniently located on the outside of the freezer. These are our two favorite features of the GE FUF21SVRWW. Power outages are noticed inside your home, but what if the power went out in your garage without your knowledge? It may be weeks before a dinner recipe requires you to open the freezer. The handy power on light and temperature monitor keep tabs on the frozen contents so you don’t have to worry. Additionally, this upright freezer is equipped with a frost-free defrost function. Frost Free means that every day the freezer automatically defrosts itself to prevent ice buildup. If you’ve ever had to spend hours chipping away at ice buildup in those old chest freezers, you’ll agree the Frost Free feature is worth every dime.","While we tend to shy away from white appliances in the kitchen, we’re not opposed to this finish for an upright freezer whose home is in the garage. This particular GE freezer doesn’t have a contoured door, which means the edges don’t curve and instead end in a flat edge. The door hinges are located on the right hand side and can’t be adjusted. The freezer’s height, width and depth are all pretty standard dimensions: 71.4 inches x 32 inches x28.6 inches. And while you can’t change the width and depth, adjustable leveling legs are included to alter the freezer’s height. The temperature monitor is located on the upper left hand corner of the door, which we think is a smart design move as well as functionally convenient."]},"id":"0f24e5e2-9ff5-4152-9bcc-2333a68ee648","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c273940a-6589-45b2-b2ca-9276ba934dea","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There is really nothing inspiring about the GE FUF21SVRWW upright freezer or anything that sets it apart from the others on the market.
