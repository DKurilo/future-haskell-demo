The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse\">Wireless Keyboards</a> here.</em>","The Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 2000 keyboard holds its own when compared to other wireless keyboards in our lineup of best wireless computer keyboards. When you purchase this keyboard, you get instant setup, freedom to roam, comfortable typing, and access to your favorite applications with the push of a button. Its many features can help you get your work done faster and make your play last longer.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>The Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 2000 gives you freedom to move about your home or office with a wireless range of 30 feet supported by 2.4 GHz connectivity and 128-bit AES encryption to keep your information secure. It takes just a few seconds to initially sync the keyboard to your computer with its USB transceiver. Our only complaint as far as connectivity is concerned is that Microsoft&#39;s receiver is able to host only this single keyboard instead of multiple peripherals like some of its competitors can. This means you will end up using two USB ports if you also want a wireless mouse to go with the keyboard.","This keyboard gives you instant access to media and internet functions and other applications. Five hotkeys located along the top edge of the frame control play, pause, mute, volume up and down, and track selection for your favorite media applications, and two more hotkeys allow you to zoom in and zoom out on digital photos and other documents. Just to the left of those an additional set of six keys is available for customization so you can create a collection of your favorite actions. At the extreme left corner of the keyboard, you will find the homepage and email hotkeys. For quick access to other common functions like Help, Undo, Redo, New, Open, Close, Reply, Forward, Send, Spell, Save and Print, you simply use a combination of one of the F keys and the function key located at the bottom of the keyboard.","The 2000 is powered by two AAA batteries that are estimated to last up to 18 months. Although it doesn&#39;t have a sleep mode or an on/off switch to help conserve battery power, it does have a battery level indicator to help you avoid being unexpectedly stuck with a dead keyboard.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>The design of the 2000 is perhaps best described as understated elegance. It sports clean lines and a relatively slim profile. Fit out in a mix of glossy and matte black with blue accents, this full-size keyboard has a standard layout with low-profile, concave-shaped keys that provide a quiet, comfortable typing experience. It also features a comfortable quilted palm rest for wrist support.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>The Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 2000 is the second peripheral in our lineup that equally supports Mac OS X (v10.4 and higher) and Windows (7, Vista and XP) platforms. Acknowledging that not all Mac users may be running the newest OS, the manufacturer also provides software for those running OS X v10.2x and 10.3x.","Microsoft offers a wide range of online support for its many products and services. You can find their keyboards listed under Products and then Hardware. The product page for the 2000 contains PDFs of the limited warranty, product guide and technical data sheet. On the same page, there is a link that takes you to the Microsoft Product Solution Center as well as one that leads to their hardware support. Both of these destinations offer answers to common questions about setup and troubleshooting. If you need to speak to a customer service representative or technician, there also is a toll-free telephone number listed on the product page. On the downside, much of the information provided online is in very general terms and not necessarily specific to the particular keyboard. This keyboard comes with a three-year warranty."]},"id":"2599ef28-a208-4522-aec4-25b48154fc2c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cd32f27d-96c3-442d-9370-46ea4b0cf353","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 2000 could be called &#34;the biggest bang for your buck&#34; keyboard.
