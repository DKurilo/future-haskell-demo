We found it for under $160 on some online retailer websites. It still has the same wattage as our favorites and allows for more customization than some of them. You can switch off the sound and the turntable on this <a href=\"/best-over-the-range-microwaves\">microwave</a>, for instance. The sound switch will come in handy for sleeping babies and the turntable turn-off will be helpful for preparing larger dishes. Most of the microwaves we reviewed did not offer those options.","On the downside, this is one microwave that only moves 220 cubic feet of air per minute. There was not a huge variation in this number among the ones we compared, but it is worth noting that it moves less air than most of the others. That may be noticeable in a smoke-filled kitchen. For one with more fan power, check out the <a href=\"/kitchen\">LG LMV1762ST</a>.","It may also be excused for having just one food preset: popcorn. That is probably the most used, but other microwaves had many more â€“ ones for pizza, potatoes, frozen entrees, and more. Those can be time savers. You will have to come up with your own time and temperature settings for commonly-prepared items.","At this price we wouldn&#39;t expect it to have sensor cooking, warm hold or even quick cook buttons, and it doesn&#39;t. There was at least one unit in our comparison that cost less and still had at least quick cook options. That is nice because you can start a timed cycle with just one button. You won&#39;t have that option with the UMV1160CS.","At this price we wouldn&#39;t expect it to have a long or strong warranty either, and it doesn&#39;t. Some of the microwaves have more coverage on the magnetron, the most expensive and important part of the microwave."]},"id":"475e1404-ee50-4ac9-a20f-03183c90a739","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"73b58097-4303-4f8d-992d-5eb418920943","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The KitchenAid UMV1160CS&#39;s airflow is limited, the warranty is lackluster and it has the fewest preset cooking options, but it also has some features that are welcome rarities, including turntable and sound shut-off options.
