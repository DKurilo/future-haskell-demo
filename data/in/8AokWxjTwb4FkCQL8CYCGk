With an MSRP of $50, it’s much more affordable than higher-end products such as the <a href=\"/clarisonic-review\">Clarisonic Mia 2</a>, which has an MSRP of $169. However, Mary Kay device earned only a B+ score in our testing for user experience – still above average, but not in the top tier.","The Skinvigorate comes with two brush heads and two AA batteries. Unlike the <a href=\"/essential-skin-solutions-review\">Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin</a> and the <a href=\"/etereauty-review\">Etereauty 5 in 1 Beauty Care Massager</a>, it doesn’t have additional attachments for microdermabrasion, full-body care or foot care. The device is not rechargeable; it requires batteries.","Having to change batteries is inconvenient enough, and the Skinvigorate’s battery cover is especially difficult to remove.","Although the Mary Kay Skinvigorate is marketed as suitable for sensitive skin, our testers thought its brush head bristles felt “scratchy.” Also, like all rotating brushes, this brush can grab and tangle long hair if you don’t pull your hair back first.","One advantage of this product is that you can tell a definite difference between its speed/intensity settings, and the higher speed makes 400-plus rotations per minute. The device is lightweight and comfortable to hold, and it’s waterproof for use at the sink and in the shower.  Full submersion, however, isn’t recommended.","Because worn brush head bristles become less effective over time, Mary Kay recommends replacing the Skinvigorate’s brush head every three months. You can get a two-pack of replacement heads for $15, which is very affordable when compared with the price of replacement heads for the Clarisonic Mia 2, which are $27 each.","Our testers liked how the Skinvigorate “kind of self-propels across your face,” and they said its motor was “nice and quiet.” Also, some members of our testing panel who had never used a facial cleansing brush before appreciated Mary Kay’s detailed guidelines for use. The company recommends daily cleansing cycles of one minute each, divided into four 15-second zones – your forehead, each cheek and your nose/chin. This will help you avoid skin irritation that can occur if you focus on one area of your face for too long.","One concern our testers mentioned with this product is that the control buttons would wear out over time. When we reached out to Mary Kay customer service with questions about the Skinvigorate’s durability, a representative told us that the device is expected to last up to 2.5 years when used as recommended. While the product doesn’t have a specifically-defined warranty, it is backed by the <a href=\"https://www.marykay.com/en-us/pages/guarantee\">Mary Kay Satisfaction Guarantee</a>. If you have questions or need consumer support, customer service is available by phone and email."]},"id":"2f2de175-9559-442a-b7e6-363a6bb7684d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65096","url":"/mary-kay-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-26T21:54:31Z","datePublished":"2015-05-26T21:54:31Z","name":"Mary Kay Skinvigorate","synopsis":"The Mary Kay Skinvigorate Cleansing Brush is a dual-speed facial cleansing brush designed to clean, exfoliate and massage the skin.","review":{"rating":76,"verdict":"The Mary Kay Skinvigorate Cleansing Brush is a dual-speed, rotating facial cleansing brush with a comfortable grip.
