They are becoming the main form of communication among individuals, whether it is by a text message, picture message or an actual phone conversation. Cell phones are replacing landline telephones as a way to communicate with family or even the next-door neighbor. These small, compact devices can cost a large amount of money, depending upon the type of plan and phone model you buy. Many individuals may not like the hassle of contracts, a monthly bill or credit checks. If not, a prepaid cell phone may be what you are looking for. These <a href=\"/mobile/phones/best-pay-as-you-go-cell-phones/\">pay-as-you-go cell phones</a> are available through cell phone providers and are customizable to you and your needs. But what are the advantages and disadvantages of using one of these devices? We&#39;ve listed out the pros and cons to help you figure out what&#39;s right for you.","<strong>Pros</strong>","One of the greatest benefits to using a pay-as-you-go cell phone is the amount of money you save from contract fees and purchased minutes. Users only buy minutes they think they will use with the option to buy more later. You don t have to buy a set number of minutes that are included in a contract; you only buy as many as you need. For example, if you have a cell phone contract that gives you 500 shared minutes, but you only use 200, you are paying for 300 unused minutes. This money is quickly slipping through your pocket. Paying for minutes as you go makes it possible to budget your phone usage so no outrageous cell phone bills can drain your bank account if you go over your allotted minutes.","Another advantage to these pay-as-you-go accounts is what they&#39;re missing. This may sound a little strange, but it is true. There are no monthly bills, no contracts to sign, no early termination fees and our favorite, no age limit. No age limit makes these cell phone plans ideal for children and teenagers. Having a set number of minutes places a limit on how much children or teens can use their cell phones, which means no surprise bills will show up in their parents&#39; mailbox.","<strong>Cons</strong>","There are only limited cell phone model options available with pay-as-you-go cell phone plans. Most of these cell phones are simple with little advanced technology. They lack features that are found in many smartphones or multimedia phones. If you want a cellular device designed with the fancy camera, music player and access to a wide variety of apps, a prepaid cell phone plan will not satisfy your needs and desires.","A large disadvantage to these plans is the difficult task of monitoring how many minutes you&#39;ve used. These devices require you to keep an inventory of the minutes you&#39;ve used. It is very easy to get carried away with your minutes and run out when you most desperately need them. You may have important phone calls disconnect or calls that you can&#39;t place because your minutes have been used up.","<strong>It is your Decision </strong>","These prepaid cell phone plans are ideal for children and teenagers. They work well for individuals who don t spend a lot of time talking on the phone or who do not care about advanced technology. These plans work well for those with few cellular needs. Take a look at what you need most with your cellular plan. By evaluating your needs, you can decide if a contract or a pay-as-you-go plan is most ideal for you."," "]},"id":"8e9147b4-7d75-4b8a-95e7-e2c09b76e62b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5438","url":"/prepaid-cell-phone-the-pros-and-cons","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"courtnie-packer","url":"/author/courtnie-packer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Courtnie Packer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"XeLDpnf8mohkN8LhxKwS3h","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-02-01T16:01:10Z","datePublished":"2011-02-01T16:01:10Z","name":"Prepaid Cell Phone: The Pros and Cons","synopsis":"Whether you like it or not, cell phones are everywhere.","review":{},"strapline":"Whether you like it or not, cell phones are everywhere.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-10T14:57:30Z","id":"gWkfcd6xtopMGnEhLqXrje","meta":{"title":"Prepaid Cell Phone: The Pros and Cons","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
