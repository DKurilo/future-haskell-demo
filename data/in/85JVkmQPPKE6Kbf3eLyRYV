You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Aio Wireless is the newest no-contract <a href=\"/best-cell-phone-providers\">cell phone provider</a> on the market. It&#39;s owned and operated by AT&amp;T, and takes advantage of AT&amp;T&#39;s nationwide 4G LTE network. This gives it great service and reliability, and better coverage than any other prepaid provider. Unfortunately, Aio lacks business plans or family share plans, and buying a new smartphone online can be a pricey proposition.","Aio Wireless (pronounced &#34;A-O&#34;) is still a new brand, but brick-and-mortar stores bearing its name are popping up across the nation. You can shop for a new phone online or at one of those stores. If you buy online, you won&#39;t have to pay an activation fee for a new phone, whereas you&#39;d be charged $25 at a store. Conversely, stores offer 12-month payment plans for new phones, which can help mitigate up-front costs. There are no payment plans for new cell phones when you buy online, which means you&#39;re responsible for paying the full – and often very pricey – retail cost of the phone.","Fortunately, when it&#39;s time to pick out a new smartphone you&#39;ll have plenty of top-of-the-line options to choose from. Aio Wireless offers new Android phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S4, as well as older models if you&#39;re on a budget. It carries Nokia&#39;s Lumia line of Windows-based phones and even sells Apple iPhones, including the recently released iPhone 5s and 5c. If you want to add a tablet to your plan, you can buy a ZTE Velox for $180, plus $15 a month for 250MB of 3G data access.","At $55 a month, Aio&#39;s core smartphone service plan is a good deal. With it, you&#39;ll get unlimited talk and text, and 2GB of high-speed data – and if you pass the 2GB threshold, you aren&#39;t charged overage fees. Instead, your data plan is throttled back to 2G speeds. A $70 plan offers 7GB of high-speed data, and additional data can be purchased for $10 per gigabyte on a month-by-month basis. There&#39;s no share plan or discount for multiple lines, so if you&#39;re looking for service for you and your family, expect to pay for each line individually.","Despite the fact that Aio Wireless operates on AT&amp;T&#39;s 4G LTE network, its users are limited to maximum 4G speeds of just 8Mbps. This may be fast, but it&#39;s much slower than any of the major carriers, including AT&amp;T – which, of course, uses the exact same network. It&#39;s as slow as or slower than the other prepaid providers."]},"id":"39757714-1540-4968-b9fe-59b8f8f8f6ad","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4e5f91d6-f0d8-409b-9e2c-b117c63adc0f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite its slow data speeds, Aio Wireless remains an impressive wireless service.
