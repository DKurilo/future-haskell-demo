The most consistent products scored higher than the others. We looked for various features, such as the number of user accounts a scale allowed, the various fitness metrics it recorded and the length of the warranty it came with. Scales that worked with both Apple and Android devices scored higher.","While evaluating an app&#39;s ease of use, we looked to see which health data was visible in chart and graph form. The more options it provided, the better. We looked for calorie and fitness trackers, as well as any additional body stats like BMI, muscle mass, bone density and hydration levels. We also scored scales on their overall appearance. We scored scales higher if they were aesthetically pleasing while not drawing attention to themselves. ","<strong>Weighing Buying Decisions</strong>","The Smart Price to Pay for a Smart Scale<br/>We tested smart scales ranging in price from about $50 to more than $250, with an average price just under $120. Pricing can be based on a scale’s biometric readouts, tracking capability, connectivity and associated apps. Generally, the more a scale offers, the more it will cost.","Connectivity<br/>Most smart scales connect to your Wi-Fi in order to sync to your mobile device. Some only allow you to use the scale&#39;s proprietary app, while others can also sync to popular third-party apps such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Amazon&#39;s Alexa app and Google Fit. You typically need to create a user account for a smart scale to work properly. The user account maximum can vary from as few as one to an unlimited number, so you should make sure the scale you buy can accommodate your household. These scales can sometime identify who you are the minute you step on them and send the data to your phone, making updates incredibly easy.","Biometrics<br/>In addition to measuring your weight, many smart scales measure body fat, lean mass, BMI, water weight and bone mass. Some even provide graphs and charts of your progress as you use them. Some apps are more user-friendly than others, but most of them allow you to set goals and reminders to help you stay on track. These scales are designed to protect your privacy from other users, so your information is only shared if you want it to be.","Aesthetics<br/>You should look for a scale that doesn&#39;t look out of place in your bathroom and won&#39;t get in the way of your day-to-day tasks. Most scales are around an inch tall, but they vary when it comes to length and width. Smaller scales can fit easier in a room, but they might not feel as comfortable for people with larger feet. The best warranties typically last for five years or more.","<strong>Bluetooth vs. Wi-Fi Connectivity </strong>","There are two wireless connectivity options for sending information from a smart scale to a mobile app: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The primary advantage of using a smart scale with Wi-Fi connectivity is that you don’t need to have your phone or fitness tracker near the scale to log a weigh-in. Some of the Bluetooth scales we tested save the data until the next time you sync the device, but most of the cheaper Bluetooth scales do not. Wi-Fi scales send all the data a smart scale collects to fitness-tracking apps, regardless of where the device is located.","Another advantage of Wi-Fi scales is connection stability. Although the setup is a bit more involved for Wi-Fi smart scales, once these scales are connected to your home network, Wi-Fi connections are much more reliable than Bluetooth syncing. We noticed a huge volume of customer complaints about constant syncing issues with Bluetooth scales, even the ones that save data.   ","The only reason to consider a Bluetooth smart scale over a Wi-Fi scale is cost. The best Bluetooth scale we tested is less than $50, and there are several cheaper models available. In contrast, the best Wi-Fi scales in our test group range from $100 to $200. If you are serious about tracking your weight using a smart scale and companion fitness app, we suggest using a Wi-Fi-enabled scale because it will ensure consistent tracking without requiring you to keep your devices close by.<br/><strong><br/>What is Body Composition?</strong>","Some scales, like the one we tested from iHealth, measure more than just the weight of your body. Body composition is an important aspect of your overall health, as your weight is made up of not just fat, but muscle, liquids and other things that are an important part of keeping you healthy. Some scales measure your body composition and will tell you how much fat, protein, minerals and water your body is made of. This way if you&#39;re trying to shrink your waistline you can watch for your fat mass to decrease while your muscle mass increases. Seeing your overall weight increase a little isn&#39;t always a bad thing, as muscle mass weighs more than fat.","Having a very high percentage of fat in your body can cause health problems including hypertension, respiratory issues and gallbladder disease. Using a scale to tell you how your body weight is broken down can be an extremely important tool for staying healthy and avoiding doctor visits. Using a body composition scale to monitor your muscle growth can also be extremely helpful for athletes or those participating in professional bodybuilding. Knowing what’s going on inside your body is key to meeting your weight or fitness goals, and body composition is a big part of that.","<strong>Maintenance</strong>","It&#39;s easy to forget about your bathroom scale once you find a place to keep it. However, you should keep it clean so that it continues to be accurate and quick. Use a small brush or cloth to wipe away dust weekly, and keep the surface of the scale clean. If this doesn&#39;t quite do the trick, try using a damp cloth. It’s important not to get the scale too wet, particularly if it has batteries. Clean gently; pressing too hard on the scale&#39;s pan can mess up the weighing mechanism and cause your scale to display incorrectly. Never turn it upside down and apply a lot of pressure. If you&#39;ve removed the batteries for a while, it&#39;s important to calibrate the scale when you reinstall the batteries. Some scales do this automatically, but others include instructions for how to do so. Finally, to make sure your scale gives you an accurate readout, weigh the same item repeatedly and ensure the readings are identical. As with any household appliance, keeping your scale clean and free of debris will give it a longer and more useful life."]},"id":"fc680485-6aa4-426c-b2bf-24d99b3b73b4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_270","url":"/best-bathroom-scales","authors":[{"email":"jchristensen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-07T00:12:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-07T00:12:00Z","name":"Best Smart Scales of 2019","synopsis":"We tested male and female body fat percentage, weight and body mass index, and ranked these scales based on their accuracy.","review":{},"strapline":"We tested male and female body fat percentage, weight and body mass index, and ranked these scales based on their accuracy.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-07T17:27:20Z","id":"mb6sc27xS7FmWrHVnnjCtd","meta":{"title":"Best Smart Scales 2019 - Android, iOS Compatible Bathroom Scales","description":"We tested male and female body fat percentage, weight and body mass index, and ranked these scales based on their accuracy."},"products":[{"slug":"yunmai-premium","url":"/product/yunmai-premium","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","name":"Yunmai Premium","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","id":"eGvdTCfHGvZZvkpVccz5sP","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"weight-gurus","url":"/product/weight-gurus","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","name":"Weight Gurus","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","id":"rrRRjuyvNYz5s4mD5fctYB","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"ihealth-core-wireless-body-composition-scale","url":"/product/ihealth-core-wireless-body-composition-scale","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","name":"iHealth Core Wireless Body Composition Scale","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","id":"khhVsbJzuTAtuASFPeNfFh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"qardiobase-wireless-smart-scale","url":"/product/qardiobase-wireless-smart-scale","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","name":"QardioBase Wireless Smart Scale","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","id":"C8GfrUG2SC3M3btH2e2gXj","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"withings-body","url":"/product/withings-body","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","name":"Withings Body","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","id":"UubHFEZpnpMDmmVBAhh2hB","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/x6Q8LUeHnfoJXshkNc5Sxa.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Bathroom-Scales-002.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/H/I/818406/original/_Hero-Bathroom-Scales-002.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","id":"x6Q8LUeHnfoJXshkNc5Sxa","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6Q8LUeHnfoJXshkNc5Sxa.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Smart Scales of 2019","description":"We tested male and female body fat percentage, weight and body mass index, and ranked these scales based on their accuracy."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/x6Q8LUeHnfoJXshkNc5Sxa.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","mimeType":"","name":"_Hero-Bathroom-Scales-002.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/H/I/818406/original/_Hero-Bathroom-Scales-002.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","id":"x6Q8LUeHnfoJXshkNc5Sxa","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6Q8LUeHnfoJXshkNc5Sxa.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Smart Scales of 2019","description":"We tested male and female body fat percentage, weight and body mass index, and ranked these scales based on their accuracy."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"health-and-beauty","url":"/health-and-beauty","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","name":"Health & Beauty","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","id":"5johNE4w3ctxAug7oACGPh","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"personal-care","url":"/health-and-beauty/personal-care","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","name":"Personal Care","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:08:32Z","id":"N6Vr7FEXykAcbcKQHGXUJ","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
