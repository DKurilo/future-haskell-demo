You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Hoover FloorMate Deluxe is an affordable, well-designed solution for scrubbing your floors. Unlike traditional hardwood floor vacuums, the FloorMate uses water, cleaning solution and  spinning brushes to clean hard surface floors.","In Wash mode, the FloorMate releases a cleaning solution onto your floor while four counter-rotating, circular brushes spin to break up stains and marks. Once those finish scrubbing the floor, you can switch the FloorMate to Dry mode, and it will suction the dirty water from the floor. A built-in squeegee helps the floor dry quickly. FloorMate holds the dirty water in a separate tank from the cleaning solution, so the solution stays dirt-free. Both tanks easily detach from the vacuum for disposal after you finish cleaning.","The FloorMate comes with an interchangeable wood floor brush, so if you plan to use it primarily as a wood floor vacuum, you can be confident the brushes will not damage the finish on your hardwood. Hoover also has a hardwood-specific cleaning solution that you can purchase.","The FloorMate has a trigger on the vacuum handle that releases more cleaning solution when you need to focus on a tough stain. This feature helps the FloorMate be  versatile, as sometimes you will need more cleaning power than the standard cleaning process will give you. Weighing just under 14 pounds, the FloorMate is light enough to be portable around the house. This is especially helpful if you have hardwood floors on multiple levels.","The FloorMate is a water-based floor cleaner, so you should only use it on sealed hard floors If your floor is very dirty, it might be a good idea to sweep or vacuum before using the FloorMate. You should consider the FloorMate as more of a mop replacement than a broom replacement, although its suction ensures that it will pick up dirt more effectively than a mop could.","The main advantage of owning a FloorMate is that it will often do the job of a broom and mop combined, saving you time and hassle. The FloorMate is not a traditional hard floor vacuum, but for many hardwood floor owners, it is an excellent choice."]},"id":"19946cfd-0bae-4d23-919b-177c110103bb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59425","url":"/hoover-floormate-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-28T15:31:52Z","datePublished":"2014-04-28T15:31:52Z","name":"Hoover FloorMate Deluxe","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-04-28T15:31:52Z","id":"Monxqr8CQHhKAPXdeR9m9V","meta":{"title":"Hoover FloorMate Deluxe Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Hoover FloorMate Deluxe is an affordable hardwood floor vacuums that uses water, cleaning solution and spinning brushes to clean hard surface floors."},"products":[{"slug":"hoover-floormate-deluxe","url":"/product/hoover-floormate-deluxe","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:43:20Z","name":"Hoover FloorMate Deluxe","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:43:20Z","id":"dopnDim5Nggkqq7GrfiqyQ","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T18:43:20Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ZVpYNFiV8x83DFdQckCZdc.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:43:20Z","mimeType":"","name":"59397-hoover-floormate-deluxe-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/59397-hoover-floormate-deluxe-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:43:20Z","id":"ZVpYNFiV8x83DFdQckCZdc","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVpYNFiV8x83DFdQckCZdc.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Hoover FloorMate Deluxe Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Hoover FloorMate Deluxe is an affordable hardwood floor vacuums that uses water, cleaning solution and spinning brushes to clean hard surface floors."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ZVpYNFiV8x83DFdQckCZdc.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:43:20Z","mimeType":"","name":"59397-hoover-floormate-deluxe-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/59397-hoover-floormate-deluxe-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:43:20Z","id":"ZVpYNFiV8x83DFdQckCZdc","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVpYNFiV8x83DFdQckCZdc.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Hoover FloorMate Deluxe Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Hoover FloorMate Deluxe is an affordable hardwood floor vacuums that uses water, cleaning solution and spinning brushes to clean hard surface floors."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/vacuum-carpet-cleaning/best-hardwood-floor-vacuum-cleaners/hoover-floormate-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:43:20Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:43:20Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"vacuums","url":"/home-and-garden/vacuums","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:43:20Z","name":"Vacuums","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:43:20Z","id":"8ELcJaCVkXQm5iVYeKWzem","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
