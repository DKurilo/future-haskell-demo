The original review is below, but check out our current top</em><i> </i><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/laundry/best-front-load-washers/\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The GE RightHeight GFWR4805FMC front-load washer sticks to its name with its built-in riser. You have 13 wash cycles and nine wash options to choose from with this front-loading washer. You can also choose from five soil levels, and five wash and rinse temperatures for each load of laundry.","This front-loading washer has a tub that measures 4.8 cubic feet, and it is ENERGY STAR qualified. Additionally, it includes energy-saving features, such as its eWash option. Total running costs are an estimated $26 a year, and it is estimated to only consume 162 kilowatt-hours annually.","This GE front-load washer includes a lot of wash cycles and options that give you variety to tackle just about any load of laundry you’ll encounter. Additionally, you even get some specialty cycles including an allergen cycle, a power-clean cycle, a steam-assist option and even a single-item wash cycle.","One of the features that impressed us the most on this front-loader washing machine is its overnight dry option. This option allows you to wash and dry a load of laundry overnight in an eight-hour time frame without having to move the laundry from the washer to the dryer. We found this feature to be quite revolutionary and impressive.","Another feature we liked seeing on this GE front-load washer is its vibration control. Its Adaptive Vibration Control uses heavy-duty springs, vibration dampeners and a balance ring to help offset the washer if it gets off balance while in use.","Unlike some front-load washing machines that are available with an optional pedestal drawer to increase the height of the appliance, this GE front-load washer comes with a built-in riser for added height. This washer sits at 47 inches high, and is 28 inches wide and 34 2/5 inches deep. Additionally, this front-loading washer is available in three colors: metallic carbon, ruby red and a standard white color. The latter is slightly less in cost than the two other color options.","The warranty coverage for this front-loading washer falls quite short. GE only covers the appliance for one year and offers no additional length of coverage for the washer tub and motor, which other manufacturers tend to offer.","For any help and support that you need, warranty-related or not, you can get support from GE by phone or email. For email support, however, you must fill out and submit an online contact form on GE’s website for the manufacturer to contact you via email. GE also provides the user manual online, along with FAQs and tutorials."]},"id":"0ba7f278-755e-4153-9747-c1aa42a2a447","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3abe69bc-eae9-46bc-ba8a-c465cee736df","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GE RightHeight GFWR4805FMC front-load washing machine has a sufficient number of wash cycles and wash options.
