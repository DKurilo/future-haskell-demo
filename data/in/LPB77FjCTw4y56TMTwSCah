Each program was carefully assessed and thoroughly tested by multiple qualified experts who record audio by trade (and sometimes just for fun). We set up multiple testing scenarios involving microphones, CDs, DVDs, flash drives and other audio input sources to simulate how the software would typically be used.","In addition, our test assistants evaluated each program’s ease of use and effectiveness. They told us who they thought would enjoy the software most – beginners or experienced users. Our assistants also discussed their opinions on each application’s customizability options and tools for both editing and exporting audio. All of this factored into our final scoring of each of these 10 products.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","Testing 10 voice recording applications was both educational and informative. We pushed each one to its limit testing its organizational, audio capturing and audio editing abilities, extensive file conversion and compression functionality, and even file importing and exporting abilities. We ran multiple tests using a USB microphone, a computer’s built-in microphone, CDs, DVDs, streaming audio and other input sources to test standard audio capture, scheduled capture and voice-activated capture. This showed us which programs could recognize and capture a quality audio recording. We worked with several built-in filters and special effects to determine the extent of each application’s editing abilities, as well as how efficiently it could edit. We also compared each program’s features and functionality with its price to determine its overall value for any user.","<strong>How Much Does Voice Recording Software Cost?</strong><br/>Voice recording software that you can use at home is largely free, thanks to popular and powerful programs like Audacity. However, there are also paid options that run from $30 up to $200, though at the higher end, the software becomes more of a DAW.","<strong>Why Voice Recording Software?</strong>","How many times have you regretted not recording an important phone conversation, business meeting or class lecture? Or perhaps you missed the opportunity to digitize your cherished cassettes and vinyl collection before time and use took their toll on them. Luckily, audio recording software presents us with a way to capture and preserve audio digitally.","Good voice recording software, with ample features and tools, is a prerequisite to a quality digital reproduction. The quality of your audio recordings, especially voice, has to be maintained through its various stages of recording, mixing, editing and burning. Otherwise, the end product could be compromised and, in extreme cases, rendered inaudible or unusable. This seemingly ominous task is made easy with modern recording software. Any person, with a little practice, can master this user-friendly software.","<strong>Key Features to Look for in Voice Recording Software</strong>","Most of the voice recording programs in our comparison come bundled with all the required tools and features needed to perform several tasks, including audio input, editing and output. There are a number of aspects you should consider while evaluating your voice recording options. Below are the features and criteria we looked at to compare the best voice recording software:","Audio Feed/Input Source for Capture<br/>Recording is traditionally done using a microphone and line-in jacks located on the audio interface panel of the computer system. But more advanced software also supports audio pick-up from media playback; CD, VCD, DVD, USB devices; internet streaming; phone recording or any audio playback by sound card. Essentially, you can record any audio being played by or through the computer. The best recording applications understand this and already have the ability to work with you if you need to work with other input sources. Consider your current input methods – and any you plan to use in the future – before choosing an application.","Record/Rip/Burn Features<br/>A few additional features are essential to the recording and sharing process. For example, recording timers and schedulers let you define the time frame of a particular session, ensuring that your recordings start and end exactly when you need.  Similarly, voice-activated recording automates the start of a recording session whenever a predefined level of audio signal (decibels) is registered by the software. All of these can make it a little easier to record things like a podcast or a college lecture without wasting space on your computer’s hard drive.","A program with both digital and analog ripping offers the most versatility for a variety of needs. Digital ripping is useful when recording digital media, and you need analog ripping with copy-protected digital media that cannot be ripped conventionally. Both are handy methods to digitize your aging CD or DVD collection, for example. Burn tools are used for saving files to optical media for storage and playback.","Filters, Effects and Editing<br/>Most of the time, simply recording the audio isn’t enough; you may want to enhance the recording or edit the files before releasing your finalized product. You might need to edit a silence, add a filter or special effect, or manage background noise. Most programs can handle standard editing needs, but the best applications can handle whatever you throw at them.","Many programs let you trim or insert a silence in an audio track or file, which typically smooths out the flow of a recording or makes it easier to add music or other effects later. Special effects like Sound Warmer, Bass Boost or Echo can also be applied to further enhance or achieve a particular audio effect. Whether you’re using filters and effects to enhance clarity or for fun voice morphing, a good set of filters is an essential component of voice recording software. Some programs – typically those with a DAW interface – offer far more effects and editing options, as they are closer to the software that studio audio engineers use.","A program with a noise reduction function can mostly or completely eliminate background noise interfering with your actual recording, such as your air conditioner, refrigerator or a vacuum. Any program worth its weight will also have a pop and click removal option for handling additional unwanted noise. Although a frequent problem, pops and clicks can come from a variety of sources and often be fussy to track down and resolve. So, having a program that automatically monitors and limits that is essential, especially if you don’t have the extra dough to purchase things like a pop filter or a more powerful CPU for your computer.","Options to change a file format and size are also useful and are often used to output files in the desired audio quality, typically to MP3. An integrated ID3 tag editor is also useful to label files appropriately for better organization for archiving and future searches.","Supported Formats<br/>If the software can’t manage or play all of your audio files, what good is it? While most voice recording suites are compatible with only a few of the most common audio file types – MP3, WAV, WMA – others go the extra mile and support additional file types, like FLAC and AAC, as well as file compression and converting. Top programs are not only compatible with a wide variety of file formats but are also adept at importing and exporting files.","Ease of Use<br/>Recording your voice – or any audio, for that matter – on your computer can be difficult when you factor in things like choosing and setting up hardware or searching for the right software application to use. However, it doesn’t have to be, and choosing the best voice recording program can make things much easier. From installation to implementation to actual use, the entire process of voice recording should be straightforward and simple.","Help &amp; Support<br/>A good help and support system is essential for a speedy and trouble-free learning experience, and further instilling confidence in the user. Help files, manuals, FAQs and tutorials address day to day issues, whereas phone support, email, live chat and forums are best for solving specific issues. The best developers host a full array of informational resources on their website and provide multiple ways to contact their technical support teams directly.","<strong>Voice Recording Software vs. DAW</strong>","You may have heard the terms “voice recording software” and “DAW” used interchangeably, but it’s important to know their similarities as well as how they differ. By learning more about these types of software, you can be better informed to make the best choice for your needs.","Voice recording software is the simpler of the two. You can record audio manually or set the program to run on a schedule or be triggered by sound over a certain decibel level. Afterward, you can edit the audio with special effects. In addition, this type of program has tools you can use to trim files, eliminate unwanted background noise and export. Voice recording software works on a laptop or desktop computer, and some programs even have compatible mobile apps you can use while you’re on the road. This is also the cheaper of the two types of software, making it a great choice for those on a budget as well as anyone not using it for professional audio production.","A digital audio workstation (DAW) is a more heavy-duty version of voice recording software. This kind of software can handle more inputs and tracks, has wider file format compatibility, and generally produces higher quality audio files. Because DAWs are more powerful, they cost more and are predominantly made for audio professionals. As such, they have steep learning curves.
