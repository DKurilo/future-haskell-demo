becoming more immersed with technology. From kitchen appliances to home security systems, the products we use are increasingly connected to smartphones. Locks are no exception. Enter the Bluetooth Smart Padlock by Master Lock. This lock is managed with a phone or tablet, making it a <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lists/gift-ideas\">great gift</a> idea for any friend or family member who appreciates the latest tech gadgets.","The digital integration of this lock is convenient. While other locks require a physical key, this one just needs your phone. After you have installed and set up the app, the lock recognizes when your phone is nearby, and all you need to do is simply press the button on the padlock to open it. You don&#39;t need to pull out a key or remember a long combination. The app does everything for you.","The app offers another useful feature. You can give anyone permanent or temporary access to the lock. All they need is a Bluetooth-enabled device. After they receive access on the app, the lock recognizes the guest user. They can open the lock without needing a key or combination. You can also give limited access to each user, where they can only open it during the daytime (7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) or during the night (7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.).","This padlock also has a locker mode. This mode disables the Bluetooth access and requires you to input a code on the lock itself to open it. This feature is useful if you plan to store your phone in a gym locker because without the locker mode, the lock could be opened by anyone since the phone is nearby.","Although these advanced features are useful, there are a few disadvantages to consider. In our hands-on experience of this smart lock, we occasionally experienced an unlock delay. It took anywhere from 3 to 25 seconds for the lock to open. We also found that the app needs to be opened for access. We could not open the lock when the phone was on standby in a pocket. Although the high-tech features are convenient, opening this lock can actually take longer to work than a standard lock.","The Master Lock Bluetooth Smart Padlock can be an excellent gift for any technology or gadget lover. The smartphone app integration eliminates the need to keep track of a physical key, and the advanced features make it convenient and secure â€“ whether you want to secure a shed door, a gym locker or the rest of the Christmas candy."]},"id":"3090c973-2337-44fb-a167-dbcfbfcf9cad","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68754","url":"/master-lock-bluetooth-smart-padlock-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-10T17:21:23Z","datePublished":"2016-11-10T17:21:23Z","name":"Master Lock Bluetooth Smart Padlock","synopsis":"Life is becoming more immersed with technology.
