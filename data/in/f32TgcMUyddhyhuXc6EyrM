In fact, one of the 10 wash cycle options is specifically for bulky laundry or sheets. Other wash cycles include soak, cold wash and a clean washer cycle. With the clean washer option, you can easily keep your washer clean and mildew-free, which will also keep your laundry fresh. You also have the option of a Power Wash cycle to treat laundry with stains that a normal cycle may not be able to handle.","In addition to the range of cycles, you have options to add an extra rinse or automatically set the washer to add fabric softener. There are also five temperature settings and three soil levels.","This top loader sports the Energy Star label. It will cost you an estimated $14 a year on operating costs and about 135-kilowatt hours of electricity annually. You can also choose to run loads through the cold wash to save on energy usage, cleaning your clothes just as effectively as a hot cycle.","The warranty on this machine isn&#39;t as great as other top-load washers. The one-year warranty covers the overall machine, including parts and any labor needed to fix manufacturing defects. You can call, email or chat with Maytag if you need help and support. The company also has the owner&#39;s manual and other documents like an installation guide available for download on its website."]},"id":"7fe4d7b7-4420-4901-abaa-b88153d17c9f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"42f51230-3b85-4f14-87cc-6037abaca1fe","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maytag HE MVWC425BW top-loading washing machine is a well-balanced washer.
