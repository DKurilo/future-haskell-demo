It’s a motorized mini go-kart and drifter that you can use in your driveway, in a parking lot or on other smooth, paved surfaces. It can go up to 12 mph and perform 360-degree spins that will delight children who ride it. However, the battery lasts less than an hour on a full charge and takes the better part of a day to recharge.","This Christmas gift comes fully assembled, but you won’t be able to use it immediately after it’s unwrapped. You must charge the go-kart for at least 12 hours before you can take it out for a spin. If you want your kids to be able to ride it on Christmas morning, open and charge it before you put it under the tree.","Razor recommends this toy for children aged 9 and older. The weight limit is 140 pounds, so even some petite adults can ride it if they want to. It’s simple to operate; there’s an accelerator pedal, steering wheel and drift bar. The steering wheel turns 360 degrees, with an arrow that indicates what direction the cart will go. You pull up on the drift bar to do the cart’s hallmark spins. Kids shouldn’t have too much trouble figuring out how it works and will be spinning and drifting proficiently in just a few minutes.","Kids should always follow the safety instructions in the toy’s owner manual. The cart has an over-the-shoulder seatbelt to keep them from toppling off. It’s also a good idea for them to wear a helmet while riding. Even though this toy only has a top speed of 12 mph, it’s fast enough to cause a serious injury if the child falls out. It’s also worth noting that the Razor Crazy Cart has no brakes, so it’s important that kids learn how to effectively slow down and stop before they try to take it to top speeds.","One of the downsides of this toy is its short battery life. On a full charge, your kids can ride this go-kart for only about 40 minutes before they run out of power, and it takes nearly 12 hours to fully recharge. So it’s a good idea to charge it overnight or keep it connected to a charger when it’s not in use.","It’s important to note that this Christmas gift is not a bumper car. While it can take a few bumps, it can and will get damaged if kids crash into objects at top speed. So it’s best to use it on a flat, smooth surface like a parking lot free of obstacles and debris.","The unit we got into our lab for testing came out of the box slightly dinged up. The front bumper had a few scratches, and the steering wheel wasn’t in mint condition either. This damage could possibly have occurred during shipping, or we could have received a refurbished unit. Despite this minor damage, we were able to use it to its full capacity while testing.","The Razor Crazy Cart may just be the biggest hit under your Christmas tree. It comes fully assembled, and as long as your child follows all the safety precautions, there’s no need to worry about serious injury. It provides a great outdoor alternative to the video games and other housebound gifts they’ll receive, and a great way to satisfy that adrenaline rush some kids crave."]},"id":"7353c0f6-4cbb-4631-a4e8-796ed7461f7e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68680","url":"/razor-crazy-cart-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-01T15:25:49Z","datePublished":"2016-11-01T15:25:49Z","name":"Razor Crazy Cart","synopsis":"The Razor Crazy Cart is a fun gift idea for kids who like things that go fast.","review":{"rating":92,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Razor Crazy Cart is a fun gift idea for kids who like things that go fast.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-11-01T15:25:49Z","id":"EZF9swhkrkhvpqSD2MPNyg","meta":{"title":"Razor Crazy Cart Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Razor Crazy Cart is a fun go-kart-style drifter that makes a great Christmas gift idea for kids.
