stand mixer is one of the smaller units we reviewed, but it still stood out while kneading enough dough for two loaves of bread with its dough hook in 10 minutes. The result was a well-worked dough that, by sight and feel, was smooth and elastic – just the right texture to make great bread. It also picked up all the bits of dough along the 4.5-quart stainless steel bowl, which means its planetary movement (with the attachment orbiting and the bowl rotating) works quite well and the attachment touches almost every part of the mixing bowl.","Unfortunately, we got varied results with one of our other kitchen tests, namely whipping egg whites, although this Oster model performed beautifully when mixing chocolate chip cookie dough.","When we tested this mixer during a cookie dough test, the ingredients for the dough came together quickly and easily, but, like even the best <a href=\"/best-mixers\">stand mixers</a>, this one left a bit of butter on the sides of the bowl.","We also put this mixer to an egg white test, whipping 4 ounces of room-temperature egg whites. Unfortunately, our egg whites did not reach stiff peaks within our testing time limit of four minutes. Instead, they came to a frothy soft peak, which is not exactly what you need for quickly making the perfect soufflé. If you want a mixer that aced all our tests and is reasonably close in price to the Oster, take a look at the <a href=\"/kitchenaid-classic-review\">KitchenAid Classic Plus</a>.","You get a splashguard with this Oster mixer, which helps protect you from clouds of flour or splashes of cream as the mixer incorporates various ingredients that you pour into it. It also has a slow start function – you can begin the mixing process at the first, lowest speed and then increase up to a maximum of speed of 12, for whipping or aerating. There are handles on the bowl that make it easy to move around, and it’s safe to clean in the dishwasher, as are the attachments, though it’s best to wash those pieces only on the top rack.","As you may expect with electric mixers, you get a paddle, whisk and dough hook attachment. However, that is as versatile as your Oster stand mixer gets – there are no compatible attachments that you can buy separately.","A two-year warranty covers any defective parts your mixer may have. From the manufacturer’s website, you can access FAQs, user manuals and recipes. You can also contact customer support by phone or contact form on the site.","The Oster Planetary Stand Mixer is not the perfect overall choice for a mixer, and it cannot replace several other appliances in your kitchen since you can’t buy attachments such as juicers, ice cream makers and the like. However, it handles itself well with smaller amounts of dough and general mixing tasks, and can serve as a useful kitchen tool for the casual everyday cook."]},"id":"7f2e775b-ec24-444d-999e-1264f2de74b6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58123","url":"/oster-stand-mixer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-13T13:25:19Z","datePublished":"2013-11-13T13:25:19Z","name":"Oster Planetary FPSTSMPL1","synopsis":"Oster’s stand mixer is one of the smaller units we reviewed, but it still stood out while kneading enough dough for two loaves of bread with its dough hook in 10 minutes.","review":{"rating":84,"verdict":"Oster&#8217;s stand mixer provides thorough mixing, and it does well with most dough recipes, but it falters a bit when trying to whip egg whites.","pros":["This mixer kneaded bread dough as effectively as bigger, more powerful mixers."],"cons":["The Oster mixer doesn&#8217;t have any additional attachments that you can buy, such as pasta makers or juicing attachments."]},"strapline":"Oster’s stand mixer is one of the smaller units we reviewed, but it still stood out while kneading enough dough for two loaves of bread with its dough hook in 10 minutes.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-16T00:00:00Z","id":"SebeJBNDmM4DWGq3nDqvEa","meta":{"title":"Oster Planetary Stand Mixer Review - Test Results and Attachment List","description":"Oster&#8217;s stand mixer provides thorough mixing, and it does well with most dough recipes, but it falters a bit when trying to whip egg whites."},"products":[{"slug":"oster-planetary-fpstsmpl1","url":"/product/oster-planetary-fpstsmpl1","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:30:32Z","name":"Oster Planetary FPSTSMPL1","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:30:32Z","id":"KQMgDKGYToE669xhEEvUGN","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T18:30:32Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ani7kqd2QGME2xrkAwjPbU.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:30:32Z","mimeType":"","name":"c62f80cb9c276a65c70d4eb47023501b.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/c62f80cb9c276a65c70d4eb47023501b.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:30:32Z","id":"ani7kqd2QGME2xrkAwjPbU","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ani7kqd2QGME2xrkAwjPbU.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Oster Planetary Stand Mixer Review - Test Results and Attachment List","description":"Oster&#8217;s stand mixer provides thorough mixing, and it does well with most dough recipes, but it falters a bit when trying to whip egg whites."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ani7kqd2QGME2xrkAwjPbU.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:30:32Z","mimeType":"","name":"c62f80cb9c276a65c70d4eb47023501b.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/c62f80cb9c276a65c70d4eb47023501b.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:30:32Z","id":"ani7kqd2QGME2xrkAwjPbU","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ani7kqd2QGME2xrkAwjPbU.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Oster Planetary Stand Mixer Review - Test Results and Attachment List","description":"Oster&#8217;s stand mixer provides thorough mixing, and it does well with most dough recipes, but it falters a bit when trying to whip egg whites."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/kitchen/best-mixers/oster-stand-mixer-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:30:32Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:30:32Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"prep-appliances","url":"/kitchen/prep-appliances","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:30:32Z","name":"Prep Appliances","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:30:32Z","id":"UzYkw8G9Wtv5rxKj3iQwCV","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
