You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Rival CKRVSTLM21 is an easy-to-use <a href=\"/best-food-steamers\">double-tiered steam cooker</a> with two 4.8-quart capacity transparent bowls. This 650-watt mini food steamer provides a convenient and healthy way to prepare home-cooked meals, and its size makes it best-suited for couples or small families. You can cook vegetables, meat, poultry or seafood and reheat leftovers using this food steamer. It’s simple, yet versatile enough to quickly steam a variety of foods.","This food steamer is basic, yet functional. Higher-end steam cookers can be a bit overwhelming to operate and have functions that are not completely necessary. This cooker has one-dial timer that you set according to what you are cooking. The user manual lists times for a variety of foods. You just set the timer (up to 60 minutes), then your food starts to cook and you’re free to do other things. Its straightforward design and ease-of-use make it a good steamer.","This Rival counter-top food steamer has an oval design with two tiers. It accommodates foods that need longer cooking time on the bottom, while foods with shorter cooking times go in the steamer bowl above. When the separator ring between the lower and upper steaming bowls is removed, it creates a double-sized space to give you flexibility to cook items that don’t fit into a single tray. For instance, you could use this feature to stand up several ears of corn and steam them all at once.","This steam cooker has an instant steam function so you can still eat healthy even if you’re in a hurry. When the removable heating element sleeve is placed around the heating element, the steamer will produce steam in 35 seconds.","Rival&#39;s double-tier vegetable steamer is compact when stored. The bowls nest so they take up less space in your cabinet. It also has a safety auto-off feature to give you peace of mind, even if you forget to turn it off. Like most other steam cookers, it cleans easily with hot, soapy water.","The Rival CKRVSTLM21 is a versatile food steamer that can help you cook healthy meals with just one appliance. It&#39;s easy to use, easy to clean and easy to store. This is a very simple cooker that is a good size for couples or small families."]},"id":"c643f066-9789-4e19-a9a1-3344b481c61e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60884","url":"/rival-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-20T21:56:34Z","datePublished":"2014-10-20T21:56:34Z","name":"Rival CKRVSTLM21","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
