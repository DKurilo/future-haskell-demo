pest control company can protect residences and businesses from many types of pests and termites. It services six states in the southern U.S., which are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee. Because Cook&#39;s only serves the South, the technicians know the types of pests this region deals with.","When you contact the company for an inspection, you can get an instant quote for the cost of services. Cook&#39;s offers one-time treatments and annual plans for both pest and termite management. Most <a href=\"/best-pest-control-services\">pest control companies </a>offer green treatments, and Cook&#39;s does, too. The company will use the best products for the situation and employ a variety of methods that don&#39;t include pesticides. When sprays, granules or other products are required, Cook&#39;s uses the least amount necessary to keep bugs out.","The types of pests that Cook&#39;s kills and protects your home from include some of the most damaging and bothersome. Ants, termites, spiders, cockroaches and mosquitoes are all the list of pests that the company will eliminate and then protect you from. However, Cook&#39;s can&#39;t remove flocks of birds or stray snakes on your property because the company doesn&#39;t offer wildlife control.","Cook&#39;s, like the best pest control services, offers return treatments within 24 hours, if needed. So if you&#39;re not happy with the results, a technician will come out to redo the treatment either within the time that&#39;s guaranteed, which is stated in your service agreement, or in between scheduled appointments if you have an annual plan. This pest control company doesn&#39;t include a section for questions you might have, but it offers enough information through other links. Also, Cook&#39;s doesn&#39;t offer online account management, but you can make payments and set up automatic payments through its website.","The pest library on Cook&#39;s website includes some of the most common pests such as ants, spiders, rodents, fleas, ticks, mosquitoes and termites. There are plenty of insects, arachnids and other critters that Cook&#39;s will take out, if you need. From the website, you can research the pests that have invaded your space and find out what you can do yourself to solve the pest problem and keep the bug from coming back.","Cook&#39;s offers a variety of general pest control services for homeowners and businesses, and its bug exterminators can take care of the most common pests, including termites. However, the company can&#39;t handle wildlife situations, and it doesn&#39;t offer online account management or 24-hour assistance."]},"id":"68157a3a-5f41-4ae5-bb72-73d3e0ff6435","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63495","url":"/cook-s-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-16T16:27:38Z","datePublished":"2015-03-16T16:27:38Z","name":"Cook's","synopsis":"Cook's pest control company can protect residences and businesses from many types of pests and termites.","review":{"rating":47,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Cook's pest control company can protect residences and businesses from many types of pests and termites.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-16T16:27:38Z","id":"QGyFSuoBinCjcCN9Uje2fM","meta":{"title":"Cook's Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Cook&#039;s provides pest control for residences and businesses in the southern United States.
