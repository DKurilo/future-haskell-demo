However, it really shines for runners because it calculates average speed up to 19.3 miles per hour. If you&#39;re training, the auto exercise timer begins once the Via Slim registers your motion and records the time you spend in motion up to 23 minutes. With a tri-axis accelerometer, this pedometer can sit anywhere on your body and still register your motion and steps accurately.","Depending on your preference, you can use the 12 or 24-hour clock display. Imperial or metric measurements in distance are also available on the display. Unfortunately, this pedometer does not have a memory to check your past progress. Instead, you have to use the reset button to clear your numbers at the beginning of each day. Before using the manual reset, the pedometer display asks if you want to clear info before it wipes the memory. We like this feature because it prevents accidental clearing and keeps you from losing your hard-earned data."]},"id":"7166cba9-468e-4743-92bd-8d7e38d3fe43","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/qBpMSiJX23GM9VSn7XVQf7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"New Balance eliminated the dork factor associated with many pedometers. We like the sharp, unisex black, gray and red coloring that matches most active or casual wear. This is a thin enough device that it will go unnoticed throughout the day. The giant LCD display shows your stats in a large, bold style so the numbers are easy to read without glasses. You have wearable options with this pedometer that suit running or walking. This New Balance model includes a removable belt clip so you can attach it to your hip or remove the clip to slip it into your pocket. If you don&#39;t have pockets or a belt loop, use the clip to secure this pedometer to your waistband or sports bra.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/58468-new-balance-via-slim4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qBpMSiJX23GM9VSn7XVQf7.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"qBpMSiJX23GM9VSn7XVQf7","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qBpMSiJX23GM9VSn7XVQf7.jpg","alt":""},"id":"9f4c90c3-9fea-41b7-b269-73a4c405b95d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is a basic pedometer, so you can find the answers to your questions in the included manual.
