appliances have a tendency to all look the same, with stainless steel finishes and boxy shapes. While a matching design can bring a cohesive look to your space, it can also bring on a case of the yawns. Boring! The Nostalgia company has a whole line of quirky products; they invoke good cheer, which is exactly what the party or even just your bad day calls for. An ice cream maker is not your typical kitchen appliance to begin with, and this Nostalgia machine is anything but typical. The best ice cream maker should be fun and you are allowed – in fact, entitled –to be excited about it!","The Nostalgia ice cream maker looks old, but it brings a new sense of giddiness to the long-standing tradition of making homemade ice cream. While the bucket is made of wood and looks like it stepped out of a 1960’s soiree, it is electric and has a heavy-duty motor.","Before you can eat any ice cream, there are a few things you need to do first. The ice cream machine does have a metal canister that fits inside the wooden bucket. You do not have to freeze the canister overnight, but it should be chilled before use. You should also chill any recipe that you create. We recommend just making the mixture the day before or the morning of and then refrigerating it to make sure the liquid is at the right temperature."]},"id":"4e65800d-da4b-4423-b493-554e4910994d","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/x5wNgk9qTZ3coHaBosXjTd.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56406-nostalgia-electrics-vintage-collection-old-fashioned-ice-cream-maker3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x5wNgk9qTZ3coHaBosXjTd.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"x5wNgk9qTZ3coHaBosXjTd","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x5wNgk9qTZ3coHaBosXjTd.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c72bbae7-5110-4c5c-b196-1f5a61fa8983","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This electric ice cream maker does make up to 4 quarts of ice cream, but your liquid mixture should only fill the canister until it is 2/3 of the way full.","The wooden bucket does do more than just add appeal. The bucket holds the ice, rock salt and canister. You will need one to two bags of ice for one batch, and up to four cups of rock salt. You will need to mix the ice and the salt together, layer upon layer, to maintain the needed temperature. As the motor runs and the paddle turns the ice cream inside the canister, the ice will melt. You will need to monitor the process and add more ice and salt as it does. You will also need to mix the ice and salt together every 10 to 15 minutes. If you are the host of a party, we suggest calling upon someone else to do the checking so that you aren’t stuck in the kitchen while your guests boogie.","The Nostalgia Vintage Collection Old Fashioned Ice Cream Maker is cool, it really is. The wooden façade brings the hint of wistfulness you desire, all while making delicious frozen treats for all to enjoy."]},"id":"6db6e34e-3838-4d38-ab30-622682f405a0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56434","url":"/nostalgia-vintage-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-20T17:22:27Z","datePublished":"2013-05-20T17:22:27Z","name":"Nostalgia Vintage","synopsis":"Kitchen appliances have a tendency to all look the same, with stainless steel finishes and boxy shapes.
