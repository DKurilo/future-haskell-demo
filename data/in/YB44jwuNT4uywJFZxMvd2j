Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Waring Pro MG855 is designed for grinding hamburgers, sausage, chili and other standard types of meat. It comes equipped with a limited motor that delivers 350 watts of power while grinding, which falls short of more powerful models intended for frequent grinding. Despite its limited performance, this <a href=\"/best-meat-grinders\">meat grinder</a> comes with all the standard accessories and parts, all protected by a lengthy warranty that ensures reliable, casual usage for many years.","This device comes with multiple parts and accessories to increase the types of meat blends you can create. This stainless steel meat grinder is equipped with a food-loading hopper large enough to hold several pounds of food. In addition to a carbon steel blade, it also comes with three plates that control the fineness of the ground meat. You can get fine grinds for spreads and hamburger, medium for soup textures, and course for ground meat in chili. Two accessories are also available for making thin or plump sausages, complete with instructions and recipes.","After grinding up your meat, even the best meat grinders need to be disassembled and cleaned. The parts on the Waring Pro easily disassemble for quick cleaning, making the process of ongoing maintenance an easier task to manage. The feeder, hopper, cutting plates and all other parts are easily removed and machine washable, removing the need to clean the grinder by hand. In addition to being easily disassembled for cleaning, the parts and motor are covered by a five-year warranty for replacement in the event of failure, which is among the longer warranties offered for grinders.","In terms of performance, the Waring Pro MG855 offers exceptional results, though with limited power. It comes with a 450-watt motor, capable of grinding up to 20 pounds of food in less than 30 minutes at an average of 350 watts while under load. It ultimately falls short due to its limited power output, which when compared to other models it achieves a fraction of the same performance. Due to its limited power, it serves better as an occasional grinder rather than for processing full livestock.
