The strength meter simply gauges the complexity of your password. You can use this tool to improve existing passwords or test new ones. If you have a hard time coming up with one, the password generator creates random strings of letters and numbers to help you come up with a tough password. This is a big help if you tend to use the same passwords all the time.
