That frustrates one of the main benefits of buying a <a href=\"/best-stick-vacuums\">stick vacuum</a> – being able to quickly clean up a smaller mess without the hassle of pulling out the full-size upright. Many of the traditional benefits of a stick vacuum cleaner are still intact with the Spiffy Maid, though. It is smaller and easier to deal with than most full-size vacuum cleaners, once you plug it in. It did a decent job of cleaning in our tests, as well, especially on hardwood flooring.","Many of the units in our stick vacuum reviews tended to just move the sawdust around on the hardwood flooring, but the Spiffy Maid was quick to clean it up. This was not really the case on the carpeting tests, though. It took more passes than most of the others to remove the sawdust on that. It also struggled somewhat to remove pet hair.","All stick vacuum cleaners are easier to maneuver than a full-size upright, but this one was less so. One problem is that it doesn&#39;t have a fully swiveling head and doesn’t get around furniture as easily as some of the others. You have to pick it up and turn it sometimes in order to keep cleaning. For more maneuverability, check out the <a href=\"/home-and-garden/vacuums\">Dyson v10 Absolute</a>.","This is one of the few stick vacs in our comparison to offer HEPA filtration, and that is a great bonus if you have any allergy sufferers in your household. It will clear more and smaller particles out of the air and flooring than other vacs."]},"id":"5844cf70-aad7-4e36-a099-f3bd17e93c56","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"11e9d919-cf8e-4cf5-9e73-f903550c45c3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Needing to be near an outlet is a pretty major drawback, but the Spiffy Maid was able to out-vacuum some of its cordless competitors on hardwood flooring, so it might be worth it if you have a lot of wood floors in your home.
