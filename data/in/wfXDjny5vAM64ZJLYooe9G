You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Robomow RM510 is a compact <a href=\"/best-robot-lawn-mowers\">robotic lawn mower</a> for small-scale gardens or lawns. Maximum lawn mowing coverage is about 4,350 square feet. Larger areas can be done over several days. When done in this manner, after the mower finishes each segment, it will return to its docking base to recharge and then complete the next portion the following day and so on until the job is complete.","This model uses two 12-volt sealed lead-acid batteries for power, and they take at least 16 hours to charge. With a full charge, the device can mow for approximately two to three hours before needing to recharge. It will return by itself to the base to recharge when needed. An included rain sensor can be setup to also tell it to return to its base when rain or high humidity is sensed, or it can be programmed to continue mowing during these times.","Height adjustment on this robot lawn mower is done manually with a knob. Cutting height can be set between 0.8 and 3.2 inches, and the cutting width is just seven inches. With only a 15-degree maximum slope maneuvering capability, this unit is not well suited for yards or gardens with steep pitches or for those with rough terrain. If the unit does become stuck, you can direct it out of the area through the navigational push buttons on the mower itself or with an optional remote control.","Programming the Robomow RM510 is done through the base unit&#39;s control pad and, with limited features and options, the setup process is simple to use. The backlit control panel includes options for scheduling, entering into edge-cutting mode and setting cutting patterns. A multizone setting is available through the robotic lawn mower&#39;s software program for up to three zones. There is no ability to schedule or control the RM510 via Bluetooth or wireless connections.","Safety features for this model include a child lock and sensors that stop the blade from rotating if it lifts from the ground or flips over. If the bumper senses an obstacle, the blade stops turning and it changes direction before it begins cutting again. A PIN-coded anti-theft lock doubles as an additional safety feature by only allowing those with the code to operate it.","The Robomow RM510 is an affordable, uncomplicated robotic lawn mower for those with a small and level lawn. The single steel blade and inexpensive batteries used on this model make routine maintenance relatively painless to the wallet, and the design is straightforward enough to replace these items yourself. A no-frills machine, the RM510 is a good choice for the both the low-tech or the high-tech individual that wants an automatic lawn mower to keep a lawn well maintained and looking nice."]},"id":"0c397bbe-9ebc-4045-b986-ffb87ecdd934","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63707","url":"/robomow-rm510-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"danny-chadwick","url":"/author/danny-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Danny Chadwick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"DhF8Hg8QQde8MtLyq8X8JN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-25T21:10:46Z","datePublished":"2015-03-25T21:10:46Z","name":"Robomow RM510","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-25T21:10:46Z","id":"wfXDjny5vAM64ZJLYooe9G","meta":{"title":"Robomow RM510 Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Robomow RM510 is a compact robotic lawn mower for small-scale gardens or lawns with maximum coverage at about 4,350 square feet."},"products":[{"slug":"robomow-rm510","url":"/product/robomow-rm510","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:15Z","name":"Robomow RM510","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:15Z","id":"EGb28f6b6HVheUvXGP6U4F","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:16:15Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/WduPQm4HPWqoLEGejzWusQ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:15Z","mimeType":"","name":"63679-robomow-rm510-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63679-robomow-rm510-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:15Z","id":"WduPQm4HPWqoLEGejzWusQ","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WduPQm4HPWqoLEGejzWusQ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Robomow RM510 Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Robomow RM510 is a compact robotic lawn mower for small-scale gardens or lawns with maximum coverage at about 4,350 square feet."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/WduPQm4HPWqoLEGejzWusQ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:15Z","mimeType":"","name":"63679-robomow-rm510-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63679-robomow-rm510-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:15Z","id":"WduPQm4HPWqoLEGejzWusQ","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WduPQm4HPWqoLEGejzWusQ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Robomow RM510 Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Robomow RM510 is a compact robotic lawn mower for small-scale gardens or lawns with maximum coverage at about 4,350 square feet."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/outdoor/best-robot-lawn-mowers/robomow-rm510-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:15Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:15Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"lawn-mowers","url":"/home-and-garden/lawn-mowers","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:15Z","name":"Lawn Mowers","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:15Z","id":"smr57URmWPEAAvpHn7aR9h","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
