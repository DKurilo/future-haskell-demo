The ear bud connects to the amplifier by a thin clear cord that goes over and behind your ear, very similar to <a href=\"/simplicity-hi-fi-review\">Simplicity Hi Fi</a> and <a href=\"/hi-bte-review\">hi BTE</a>. The amplifier comes in either tan or black and is small and discreet. You can choose to wear just one amplifier or you can wear one behind each ear. Each amplifier has one directional microphone.","This hearing aid comes with four preprogrammable settings, so you can adjust it to whatever environment you encounter. The first three channels range from 17-32 dB, which is at the low end of hearing loss and is best for people with mild impairment. The fourth channel is telecoil, which is designed to improve sound quality when you&#39;re using a phone, but it also enhances what you hear when you&#39;re at the movies or watching TV. The Pro Hear IV filters out background noise when you&#39;re in a busy place like a restaurant, or you can set it to catch every sound when you&#39;re out in nature. It also has a wind screen built in along with 10-channel noise reduction so that you only hear what you want to hear.","The Pro Hear IV emits quiet tones when you change programs, so you know that you pushed the right button. It also notifies you when the battery is running low. Each program has its own distinct sound so you know which one is active. This digital hearing aid also has adjustable volume that works in each of the programs.","This hearing aid is designed to provide digital, CD-quality sound even when you&#39;re in a crowded, noisy room. It also comes with advanced feedback canceling, so you&#39;re less likely to hear feedback when using this device. The ear bud comes with foam tips in three different sizes and a hard carrying case. The battery life is 120 hours on a type 312 battery. However, it only comes with one battery, so you may need to buy more if you use this device regularly.","The Pro Ears Pro Hear IV is a digital hearing aid that&#39;s beneficial if you have mild hearing loss. It also comes with a one-year warranty. It is useful in multiple situations but it is not waterproof."]},"id":"c228b45f-89bf-49e9-8c3c-01439f7031cd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66648","url":"/pro-ears-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-21T20:46:48Z","datePublished":"2015-08-21T20:46:48Z","name":"Pro Ears Pro Hear IV","synopsis":"The Pro Ears Pro Hear IV is a digital hearing aid with a sound amplifier that fits behind your ear and an ear bud that rests inside your ear.
