The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/science/best-weather-stations/\">Weather Stations</a> here.</em>","This home weather station measures wind speed and direction using GPS coordinates for additional accuracy. It is rugged and durable without any moving parts. It employs six sensors that provide accurate data. By using a compass and GPS readings, the unit is able to calculate the true wind speed and direction. The manufacturer supplies the cable needed to link the sensors to your computer.","The software is included in the cost of this personal weather station, and it saves data for viewing later. The data is publishable to Weather Underground for viewing on multiple computers. Using the software, you can develop software applications set to specifically meet your needs. This customization is a feature not available in other systems and allows you to get the data you want. The software included with this wireless weather station requires a computer processor speed of 1GHz and 512MB RAM memory with 120MB free space and an additional 50MB per year needed for storage. The unit comes with a 600-day money-back guarantee.","The device uses an ultrasonic anemometer to measure both wind speed and direction. Pulse transmission is negligible when the wind is nonexistent but speeds up when wind begins to blow. Wind direction influences the pulse speed since wind blowing in an opposite direction slows the pulse differential. A microprocessor on each transducer in this outdoor weather station calculates the wind speed and direction in this weather station.","This weather station displays both apparent and true wind using this method, a distinctive feature not found in many other similar instruments. You can choose to express wind speed in either miles per hour or knots with this home weather station.","The ambient air falls well into the negative range with an accuracy of plus or minus 2.7 degrees. The temperature accuracy with this outdoor weather station is 0.1 degrees Fahrenheit. The relative humidity ranges from 10 to 95 percent, and the barometric pressure is measured in inHg.","The New Mountain NM100 Weather Station is a sophisticated instrument. The use of ultrasonic measurements and incorporation of GPS along with detailed computer analysis using the included software makes for a high degree of accuracy. Another benefit of this personal weather station is the ability to modify software for individual use and a 19-month guarantee, but the price reflects the high-end nature of this device."]},"id":"ede4afed-6dd9-4d2f-bb0a-a00da8f8eff2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63341","url":"/new-mountain-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-09T19:46:25Z","datePublished":"2015-03-09T19:46:25Z","name":"New Mountain NM100","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-09T19:46:25Z","id":"cCUvVYdoZrJhdkCGFpnXyJ","meta":{"title":"New Mountain NM100 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The New Mountain NM100 weather station employs six sensors, including a compass and GPS, that provide highly accurate data."},"products":[{"slug":"new-mountain-nm100","url":"/product/new-mountain-nm100","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:13:56Z","name":"New Mountain NM100","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:13:56Z","id":"ztnuat3vAMyaQ5ZiV5PH3C","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:13:56Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/yUno5aShb5rcx2rivypgTQ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:13:56Z","mimeType":"","name":"63313-new-mountain-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63313-new-mountain-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:13:56Z","id":"yUno5aShb5rcx2rivypgTQ","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yUno5aShb5rcx2rivypgTQ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"New Mountain NM100 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The New Mountain NM100 weather station employs six sensors, including a compass and GPS, that provide highly accurate data."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/yUno5aShb5rcx2rivypgTQ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:13:56Z","mimeType":"","name":"63313-new-mountain-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63313-new-mountain-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:13:56Z","id":"yUno5aShb5rcx2rivypgTQ","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yUno5aShb5rcx2rivypgTQ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"New Mountain NM100 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The New Mountain NM100 weather station employs six sensors, including a compass and GPS, that provide highly accurate data."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/science/best-weather-stations/new-mountain-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:13:56Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:13:56Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
