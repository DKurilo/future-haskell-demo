You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Philips AmbientLED is almost as bright as a 60-watt incandescent bulb but only uses 12.5 watts to operate. With a lifespan of 25,000 hours, this <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/light-bulb-guide,review-1986.html\">solid-state lamp</a> will last for almost 23 years if you use it according to industry guidelines of 3 hours per day. It also comes with one of the longest warranties of the LED light bulbs we reviewed.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>This solid-state lamp is Energy Star qualified. While LEDs are energy-saving bulbs, not many qualify as Energy Star products because they don&#39;t meet all the requirements.","Still, this LED lamp doesn&#39;t have a high lumens-to-watts ratio. The brightness of light is measured in lumens. This Philips LED light provides 64 lumens per watt. Overall, it gives off 800 lumens, which makes it comparable to a 60-watt incandescent bulb that gives off 840 lumens. It only takes 12.5 watts to operate, however, rather than 60.","These energy-saving bulbs run for 25,000 hours. It&#39;s important to follow the guidelines on the temperature, however, because the light-emitting diodes inside the light bulb are heat sensitive. The Philips AmbientLED needs to be operated in conditions between -4 and 109 degrees Fahrenheit.","The Philips AmbientLED is soft white with a correlated color temperature of 2,700 Kelvin. It also scores 80 on the color rendering index (CRI). This index helps you know how close objects will appear in color in artificial light compared to how they would appear in natural daylight, with sunlight being 100 on the scale.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>The light-emitting diodes give off a bluish light. Philips has added yellow lenses on the bulb. When you turn the light on, the yellow lenses appear white, and the light is a warm white.<br/>This LED lamp has a standard base and an A19 bulb, so you shouldn&#39;t have any trouble using it in your current fixtures. The maximum overall length (MOL) of this light bulb is 4.2 inches and the diameter is 2.3 inches, which is barely shorter and thinner than a standard incandescent bulb.","This omni-directional bulb distributes light in all directions, including downward. This means it&#39;s great for table lamps where it&#39;s nice to have light that goes up as well as down in the fixture. Additionally, the Philips AmbientLED is a dimmer bulb, so you can adjust the brightness of the lamp.","You can use this solid-state lamp inside or out, as long as you keep it in a place where moisture can&#39;t accumulate on it. A downward facing can is a great location for these energy-saving bulbs in an outdoor application. You&#39;ll also want to remember that LED bulbs have minimum and maximum operating temperatures of -4 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>This LED light comes with one of the longest limited warranties among the LED lamps we reviewed, which is six years. Philips supplies its telephone number and email if you have questions about the product or the warranty."]},"id":"96ae7827-4f15-4067-b092-01d653a7031c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9027628e-8663-46f7-80da-c73f93a01fea","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Philips AmbientLED is a great solid-state lamp.
