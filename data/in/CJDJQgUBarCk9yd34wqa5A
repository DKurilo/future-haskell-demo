The manufacturer recommends avoiding butter, margarine, lard or shortening since these can burn the corn or cause a great deal of smoke during the popping process. After that, you just push the on button and watch as the stirring rod gently moves the kernels around inside. Unlike some popcorn makers, this device uses a stirring rod that automatically reversing itself from time to time so kernels do not get stuck. In short order, you will have a generously sized bowl of great popcorn. The user manual for this popcorn popper indicates the amount of oil and corn to use to produce different amounts of popcorn.","Unfortunately, there is a small bit of waste with this hot oil popcorn popper. Out of one cup of kernels, we got plenty of excellent popped corn, but we also found 1.25 teaspoons of unpopped kernels remained. This is not a lot of unpopped kernels in the world of popcorn makers, although none would have been ideal. We found no burnt popcorn in the remaining batch, and the resulting bowlful tasted great.","If you want to add butter to your popcorn during the popping process, you can put pats of butter into the butter well located on top of the dome and the heat of the machine and the steam emerging through the vents will melt the butter. It will drip down onto the corn as it is being made. You get a handy lid to put over the butter well/vent after the popping is finished so no butter leaks out when you flip the dome over to use as a serving bowl."]},"id":"86137112-db0f-4c41-9ad1-db0dbc01688d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"58cb38eb-1beb-4ab0-b1ed-568fabde2987","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/TyG67NJKd4aa3Uiyugt6BX.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Although it might seem like a small matter, this popcorn popper&#39;s on-off switch is a significant safety feature that you undoubtedly will appreciate and it&#39;s especially useful if you have children making popcorn.
