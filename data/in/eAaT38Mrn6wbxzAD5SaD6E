Instead, we opted for electric-only models, since these seemed to be the most popular and preferred models on the market.","We also watched user videos to see how real people coped with these devices, and we paid special attention to how they appeared to feel about the machines and what they said, especially regarding the effort they had to put into getting their machine ready, using it and putting it away.","<strong>How We Researched </strong>","We spent 60 hours researching portable washing machines, carefully evaluating each model to find the best options. We wanted to find excellent, compact portable washing machines and looked for a range of capabilities, sizes and prices.","We examined the dimensions, ease of use and performance. We found general information about portable washing machines on the internet and on manufacturers’ websites. After that, we looked for specific information about particular models that looked appealing, paying close attention to consumer reviews, blogs and the level of satisfaction – or disappointment – expressed by people who had actually used the machines. In addition, we examined a range of prices so that you could have a large array of options.","<strong>How Much Do Portable Washing Machines Cost?</strong>","The average cost of the washing machines we evaluated was $423. We found full-size washers available for around $500, so if you’re willing to spend a little more and space isn’t an issue, we recommend shopping around for a full-size option. On the other hand, if you don’t have much room, these washers work really well.","<strong>How to Clean a Portable Washing Machine</strong>","Over time, the interior of your portable washing machine can build up soap, dirt and mineral residue. If you let it sit like this, it&#39;s possible your washer could start to grow mold or other bacteria. After all, bacteria love warm, wet places. Remove bacteria by running a cycle with either vinegar or bleach. Never combine vinegar and bleach together. Carolyn Forte from <a href=\"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/cleaning/tips/a32773/cleaning-products-never-mix/\">Good Housekeeping</a> states, “Together, they produce chlorine gas, which even at low levels can cause coughing, breathing problems and burning, watery eyes.” Remember, safety first.","To clean your device, make sure it is empty. Then, run a cycle of hot water with no detergent added. Once the tub is filled, pause the unit and dump 4 cups of either bleach or vinegar into the water. Remember, do not mix the two. Let the cycle run for a few seconds so that the water can mix with the bleach or vinegar. Then, pause the cycle for an hour. The chemicals will do most of the work for you. After an hour has passed, allow the cycle to finish and drain. While the interior is still damp, use a rag to remove any of the grime left behind.","To learn other cleaning techniques for portable washing machines, check out <a href=\"https://www.danby.com/blog/clean-inside-portable-washing-machine/\">Danby’s</a> website.","<strong>What Features to Look For in Portable Washing Machines <br/></strong>","Size<br/>These machines are designed for use in small living quarters, so they’re designed to do quite a bit of work without having a big footprint. It’s important to get the dimensions for the machine you are considering, since you’ll need storage space, easy maneuverability to a sink and enough room to position hoses.","Pricing<br/>If you are in the market for a portable washing machine you are likely concerned with both size and price. These machines are generally priced below what larger, non-portable units cost. The best sellers on sites like Home Depot and Lowe&#39;s cost an average of about $450. Even the best-reviewed units in this category are relatively inexpensive, averaging only about $350. So, you can generally get a great machine for less than $500.","Energy Use<br/>You can save a considerable amount of money if you buy a well-designed machine that is energy efficient. Models we examined ranged from costing approximately $12 a year up to $17.","Cycle Settings<br/>The greater the number of cycle and water settings, the better. Having more choices means you can extend the life of your clothes by washing them with the correct amount of force to really clean them but not wear out fabrics. ","Design<br/>Certain features, such as having handles on each side and rolling wheels on the bottom, can make a huge difference when it comes to actually using your portable washer.
