You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Crochet Charts software simplifies pattern creation for <a href=\"/best-embroidery-software\">crochet designs</a>. The company’s purpose is to create a method for experienced crocheters to turn their original creations into repeatable patterns that can be used by anyone. Drawing from a library of common symbols, Crochet Charts helps you translate your crochet procedure into a form that can be used privately or made public.","The program uses common symbols and abbreviations to describe single crochet, double crochet, half-double crochet and more. And for those times a pattern calls for a stitch of your own creation – a combination of several of the basic stitches – Crochet Chart provides you with the ability to design and name your stitch and add it to the symbol library. The program also allows for the free placement of stitches, the ability to save time by automatically creating rows, and the ability to export the finished pattern into an industry-recognized format as well as simple plain-text. You can insert specific instructions at any point in the pattern that might require explanation.","Crochet Charts is a simple and straightforward program. Each screen has an illustration of the stitch pattern in the center of the screen, with the deciphering legend on the right side. The dialog box on the bottom features row-by-row instructions, with an added dialog box in which to select the row to edit. If the pattern you create requires a round chart, Crochet Charts includes wedge lines for reference. You can also include multiple charts in one document, which helps keep your patterns organized.","There is no technical support option, but there is a web form in the website’s Contact tab. There is also a page of FAQs on the website, as well as a link to the popular fiber arts website Ravelry. Users may get additional use out of the website’s video tutorials, delving into the nuts and bolts of pattern creation. Stitch Works Software makes clear that users are free to sell the patterns that they create using Crochet Charts, in exchange for credit to Stitch Works for providing the program.","The software is available for Windows, Mac and open-source operating system Ubuntu."]},"id":"bcf27c51-db0c-4cc2-aff1-85f4468467b2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61211","url":"/crochet-charts-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-18T17:05:51Z","datePublished":"2014-11-18T17:05:51Z","name":"Crochet Charts for Windows v1.1.4","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-11-18T17:05:51Z","id":"66b66qtGtiu3kicRhuMg9N","meta":{"title":"Crochet Charts for Windows v1.1.4 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Software that automates charting crochet patterns and turning them into stitch-by-stitch instructions.
