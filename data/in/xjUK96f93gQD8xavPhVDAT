It means that you don&#39;t have to rely on a third-party player. Buying a system that requires you to provide your own player adds layers of work on the user. Not the least of these is the necessity of using multiple remote controls to manipulate the settings on your AV receiver and your disc player, in addition to the multiple settings on each device that you hook up to the receiver. Having an integrated player just makes thing simpler.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/48573-panasonic-sc-bt3003.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSZKHjN9AfMfH8uoSqWefn.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"zSZKHjN9AfMfH8uoSqWefn","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSZKHjN9AfMfH8uoSqWefn.jpg","alt":""},"id":"9d04f643-1b03-4e06-98ff-1de57a89669f","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["On a related note, if you put a standard-definition DVD into the Blu-ray player, not only will the system play your content, but it will also upconvert the standard-definition images on the DVD to an HD signal that takes advantage of all the viewing real-estate available on an HD television or monitor.","The on-screen interface found on the Panasonic SC-BT300 is simple, clean and intuitive. It recognizes and displays nearly any device connected to the system. This is great because, again, it makes things simpler. Manipulating the settings and functions of multiple devices from one screen is not something many systems get right. This one does.","Another great feature of the Panasonic SC-BT300&#39;s video capabilities is internet-streaming functionality.
