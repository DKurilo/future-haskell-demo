Detailed bass lines don&#39;t drown like they can in other <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">bass headphone</a> models. The open-air design is beneficial for sound quality, but it is detrimental to noise isolation. Everyone around you can hear your music and you can hear all the outside noise as well. This set also doesn&#39;t offer additional features, so what you see is what you get – just a pair of headphones.","The sound quality of the Sennheiser HD 650s is wonderfully detailed. The sound is highly authentic, especially for vocals and trebles. The over-ear design seals in the bass, but the open-air construction does allow for two-way sound leakage. For headphones with good bass, the impedance level is relatively high at 300 ohms, will drain battery life from your music device. The 102 decibels of sound ensures you&#39;ll catch every note during your loudest music sessions. A low 500-megawatt power output is inconvenient, so you can&#39;t crank the volume. On a high note, the 10-39,000Hz frequency range means you can feel those rumbling bass lines that are too low for human hearing.","A major drawback of the Sennheiser HD 650s is the absence of a remote control and microphone. Nothing comes in the box except for the headphones themselves, a 9.8-foot cable and product manual. An adapter is included for a 3.5 mm audio jack, but it&#39;s bulky and inconvenient when you want to plug it into your phone or portable device. You&#39;ll have to buy your own storage case if you want to protect these solid bass headphones because one isn&#39;t included.","The best headphones for bass typically need to be very comfortable to accommodate head pulsing bass. The Sennheiser HD 650s have soft velour earcups for long playtime so you won&#39;t get headaches. Even though they&#39;re on the medium side when it comes to weight, the overly large earcups help distribute the 9.2 ounces proportionately across your head. If you have big ears, these headphones are super accommodating. If you have small ears, the headphones may feel like they sit too high on your head. These headphones don’t fold either, so toting them is difficult.","For an international company, Sennheiser does an excellent job of solving your local concerns. You can reach Sennheiser by email or phone, and in our experience, representatives usually respond quickly. Although there is no live chat feature on the website, Sennheiser does have FAQs and a vast database of user manuals that are easy to download. A full two-year warranty covers your bass headphones from harm, and additional warranty programs are available to cover them for as long as you need."]},"id":"77bfe2e2-d02d-4784-ba5b-95c5bcddb361","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9ff0aa7d-0942-44ab-adda-7f34c2384d69","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Sennheiser HD650 bass headphones present you with detailed, precise bass, which sounds almost acoustic due to the open-air design.
