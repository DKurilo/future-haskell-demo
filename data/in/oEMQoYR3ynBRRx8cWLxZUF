The original review is below, but check out our current top <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">3D Printers</a> here.</em>","The balance between speed and quality is a tricky one, but the Airwolf AW3D HD printer bridges the gap. Both quick on its feet and high-performing, the AW3D HD beats out many other 3D printers for producing the best of both worlds.","Printing your 3D designs on the AW3D HD is extremely fast and efficient. Speeds can reach up to 150 mm per second. Not only can you print quickly, you can also print in large scale for a consumer-grade 3D printer. Prints can be as large as 12 x 8 x 12 inches, which is much larger than other comparable 3D printers","3D printing filament for the AW3D printer are universal 3-mm ABS and PLA cartridges, which you can buy directly from Airwolf or from any 3D printer manufacturer. The AW3D HD is a single-head printer, so your models can only print in one color at a time. You should also be sure to frequently clean the nozzle, as filament builds up over time on the metal piece.","Straight out of the box, this printer is fully assembled and ready to print. Made out of acrylic, this solid 3D printer has an LCD screen and a heated platform, so your ABS prints won&#39;t warp. Calibrating the 3D printer is pretty easy, as the printer does most of the work for you. The print bed heats up quickly and has an automatic adjustment feature. However, you need to make some manual adjustments after printing a few models or if you move the printer. In case you run into any trouble, the manual covers all functions in great depth.","Along with the AW3D HD, other printer models are available from Airwolf. The HDL is a PLA only printer and a better value option. The HDX can print with extra materials available from Airwolf including HIPS, polycarbonate, nylon, flexible filaments and more. The HD2X can do the same but with two heads instead of one. The HDR is the most advanced printer from Airwolf and includes a tablet for full, untethered control of your printer and designs.","The MatterControl software and 3D printer work with both Windows and Mac operating systems, so you don&#39;t have to worry about computer compatibility. To print 3D models you designed or from files you find online, you can connect the printer to your computer via the USB cable or save files to the micro SD card and print without your computer.","Included with the printer are a power cord, USB cable, maintenance tools and a starter filament cartridge. The 3D printing software MatterControl comes with the AW3D HD, and it has enough functions and features to please even expert 3D modelers. It is well-designed software with a simple navigation system.","A manual and tutorials for the AW3D are available on Airwolf&#39;s website, along with a wiki, blog and FAQs page for all of your printing questions. If a part breaks during the first year, the AW3D is under warranty, so you don&#39;t have to worry about being stuck with a defective printer. Contacting Airwolf is also pretty easy through email or phone support. We found that all of our questions were answered promptly and fully by support staff."]},"id":"bd57ddc6-018f-4671-bb4f-ddbf21fee91b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ad43d980-480b-41d8-9e6e-e157a6a4f251","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The AW3D HD printer is a large-capacity, quick-printing option for either home or office use.
