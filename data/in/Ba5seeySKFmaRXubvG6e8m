It contains a 15-amp 2,200 MWO motor, creating the power and drive needed for most any cutting job. It also contains a 56-degree beveling capacity with stops at 45 and 22.5 degrees for easy adjusting.","The lower guard design and a clear line of sight increase the accuracy of the tool’s cutting. The clear line of site enables you to see the blade from virtually any angle to reduce the frequency of mistakes. The lower guard design contributes to that increase in performance by making bevel cuts and cutting shims that are easier to manage.","When it comes to the simple task of cutting jobs, the DeWalt runs smoothly, has a good line of sight, feels well-balanced and isn’t bogged down when cutting due to the lower blade guard. The motor provides a significant amount of torque for making straight cuts on do-it-yourself projects. The stability of the device allows for long cuts, and you can even slice through a 2 x 4 in less than two seconds.","The design of the tool allows for easy cutting in non-conventional positions. It’s both light and well-balanced, which means you can hold it at odd angles without strain and still see where you’re cutting because you have a clear line of sight.","The DeWalt DW368 proves up to the task of most DIY projects, though it can also perform some heavy duty cutting if a project calls for it. This cordless circular saw doesn’t have the price tag of most heavy duty devices, which makes it a reasonable purchase considering the features it includes. If you’re needing a circular saw, but don’t want to commit to a high price, this is an ideal purchase. And you won’t be missing out on all the features just to obtain that low price point."]},"id":"b965263d-b8b1-4992-914b-65377efec7e4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57498","url":"/dewalt-dw368-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"J.D.
