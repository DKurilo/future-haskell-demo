It works similarly to other online video game rental stores, but it offers some perks that make it unique.","As with other rental services, you choose a membership plan that makes the most sense for your budget and your gaming habits. Casual gamers can rent one game at a time per month, while the hardcore gamer plan lets you pick out two games at a time. You can keep your rental as long as you’d like because Game Access doesn’t charge any late fees. However, you won’t get the next game in your queue until you return the first game you borrowed. You just drop the game in the prepaid envelope and send it back. A few days later, you get the next video game on your list.","If you find a game through Game Access that you really like and you want to keep it, you can take advantage of the service’s “rent to own” option, which lets you buy the game at a discounted price. As you rent and buy games through Game Access, you earn Reward Points, which you can use to get money off of products from the online rental service’s store.","You can find new releases from the latest consoles, like Xbox One and PlayStation 4, but you can also rent games for other consoles, like Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Game Access also offers games for Nintendo’s Wii and for handheld gaming systems like the 3DS, PS Vita, DS and PSP. And if you want to play even older titles, you can find titles for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo’s GameCube.","Game Access is easy to contact if you have any questions – you can email, call or chat online with one of the support team’s members. The FAQs section includes a variety of questions and answers about how it all works or, for example, what you need to do if you lose the prepaid envelope.","Game Access offers its members thousands of game titles for a variety of game consoles, but it’s only available for Canadian residents. It’s one of the few online video game rental services that offers points that can be redeemed for discounts off of games and other merchandise."]},"id":"03840138-1c85-4e8a-98cb-6677b3d8aa35","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68657","url":"/game-access-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-31T16:54:19Z","datePublished":"2016-10-31T16:54:19Z","name":"Game Access","synopsis":"Canada’s biggest online video game rental service, Game Access boasts more than 4,000 titles its members can choose to borrow.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Canada’s biggest online video game rental service, Game Access boasts more than 4,000 titles its members can choose to borrow.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-31T16:56:55Z","id":"3iYq8RqoqJqXsSsyWyQdxn","meta":{"title":"Game Access Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Game Access is an online video game rental store that serves Canadian residents with more than 4,000 video game titles.
