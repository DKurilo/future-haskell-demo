As far as consumer video cameras are concerned, that’s fairly large, especially compared to the 1/5.8-inch sensor on the <a href=\"/sony-hdr-cx405-review\"> Sony Handycam HDR-CX405</a>. In general, larger sensors produce more detailed images with less grain in low light, which fits right in with what we noticed while analyzing our test footage. Of the cameras we tested, only the Panasonic HC-X920 bests it for image quality, utilizing the same sensor.","Its native shooting resolution is 1080p, and it can shoot at that resolution at up to 60 fps. Although 4K seems to be the next big resolution to come to televisions and cameras, we think that 1080p remains a perfectly effective resolution for most people using HD camcorders today. Its still image resolution is 5.2 megapixels, which is decent but not great compared to the resolution of modern smartphones.

As you zoom in on a subject, the audio becomes more focused with less emphasis on ambient sounds.","The touchscreen and menus within the camera could be better.
