You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The CADEX 12 Alarm Watch and medical ID device is easy to program and use. When there is no emergency, the watch shows you the time and date just like any other timepiece. However, with this gadget you can program reminders like alarms and text messages to let you know the name and dosage of the medication you should be taking, similar to <a href=\"/healthid-review\">Health ID</a> and <a href=\"/care-review\">Care</a>, which integrate with smartphone technology.","This feature makes this product especially useful for people who need to keep on a schedule with medications, but need help remembering what to take and when. For instance, seniors that live alone as well as globetrotters and professionals who work irregular hours may find this product to be a lifesaver. If you aren&#39;t able to take your medicine as soon as the alarm goes off, just press the snooze button, and the watch will remind you again in three minutes. A master switch lets you turn off the alarms when necessary, for example, when you are in meetings or church.","The CADEX watch also works as a <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-bracelets\">medical ID bracelet</a>, and your comprehensive medical information is held in the Medical ID databank. Pressing the &#39;alert&#39; button on the front of the watch can access this information, and you repeatedly push the button to scroll through the contents.","Information that you can store in the watch includes name and phone number, medical information and any severe allergies. You can also program things like your doctor&#39;s information, emergency contact information, health insurance number, blood type and birth date. Because everything is programmed through the watch itself, there are no security measures such as PIN or password.","This medic alert bracelet is suitable for men, women and children. A standard rubber strap is included, and the watch is compatible with most standard 18 mm watchbands if you would like a different look or a smaller band. You can also choose to purchase a pendant kit so that you can wear the watch around your neck if it&#39;s too large for your wrist.","This watch and ID bracelet is a feature-rich watch that acts as a <a href=\"/best-medical-alert-systems\">medical alert</a> and helps you stay on track with medications without the need for email or a cell phone. However, because the alarm uses both sound and text, it&#39;s it may not work for you if you are hearing or vision impaired. Also, while the watch is water resistant, it is not waterproof, which means you shouldn&#39;t wear it in the shower or while swimming, which may be inconvenient for active people.","The CADEX 12 Alarm Watch from e-pill is a medication reminder and an in case of emergency (ICE) medical alert bracelet. You can set up to 12 reminders that tell you what medications you need to take at specific times. In the event of an emergency, you or a first responder can press the alert button to access your medical history and information."]},"id":"e38f1105-2c91-40a6-ac9b-d81aafe5a8b6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63674","url":"/12-alarm-watch-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-24T19:15:57Z","datePublished":"2015-03-24T19:15:57Z","name":"CADEX 12 Alarm Watch","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-24T19:15:57Z","id":"hNDeSDydvjo2QNub4FDEDd","meta":{"title":"12 Alarm Watch Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The 12 Alarm Watch from e-pill delivers plenty of features for the price.
