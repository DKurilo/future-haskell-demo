It even stood out in some positive ways from the pack. The WMH31017HZ comes in four different finishes, which is more than most, including black, white, stainless steel and fingerprint resistant stainless steel. That way you can get just the right look for your home.","There are preset cycles for potatoes, popcorn and pizza, though we found more presets on other <a href=\"/best-over-the-range-microwaves\">microwaves</a>. There is also a button specifically for softening or melting. All of those can keep you from wasting time guesstimating on time and power levels. When you do want more control over the cycle you run, you can choose from cook, reheat and defrost modes. You can also lock the controls so little ones do not accidently cook any of their toys.","The fan speed and cooktop light are both adjustable, so you can cater to different circumstances. The fan can move up to 300 cubic feet per minute, which ties for the most, so you don&#39;t have to put up with cooking odors for long. Not all of the microwaves offer different cooktop light settings, so that is a nice extra.","This is not one of the microwaves that has a rack, so you can’t double your space. There is plenty of internal space, so not having a cooking rack shouldn’t be too bothersome. It also lacks the ability to shut off the turntable or sound. It can be nice to shut down the turntable on large dishes, but that is not the most common use of microwaves, which most often spend their days reheating plates or popping popcorn. If you prefer these options, though, consider the <a href=\"/kenmore-review\">Kenmore 80333</a>."]},"id":"180b20d5-fb03-4ae9-aa66-2562112eb096","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5a4c255e-e99b-4b7a-ae7a-6e4f0504c199","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool WMH31017HZ has a relatively weak warranty and large price tag.
