This fryer also includes a handful of safety features, although it lacks a vital one.","It’s recommended you only fry turkeys under 18 pounds in this 32-quart pot. Frying a turkey over 18 pounds can cause an oil spill, serious injury or even a fire. If you need a smaller outdoor turkey fryer, try the <a href=\"/cabelas-review\">Cabela’s Ultimate</a> turkey fryer.","The burner has a heat capacity of 55,000 Btu, so it can heat the oil and pot very quickly. It uses a maximum of 3 gallons of oil, which is slightly less than most outdoor propane turkey fryers can handle.","This turkey fryer doesn’t have an auto shut-off, which would automatically turn it off if it were to overheat. However, it includes a few other safety features. For instance, it has a vented lid, a poultry rack and a lifting hook. The lifter and poultry rack work similarly to a cooking basket, helping you place the turkey into the pot and remove it after cooking.","This outdoor turkey fryer doesn’t include many convenience features, but it does have a thermometer. The thermometer helps you ensure the oil doesn’t get too hot and that the turkey is cooked throughout.","Like most manufacturers, Bayou Classic covers its turkey fryer with a one-year warranty. You can find an online manual on the company’s website, which is convenient if you lose the physical manual the fryer comes with. The site even has a handful of frequently asked questions about frying a turkey. Additionally, you can contact the manufacturer by email for help and support."]},"id":"ef0b1815-9066-45ea-9bb4-7cd840a011b1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60082","url":"/bayou-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-29T17:01:36Z","datePublished":"2014-07-29T17:01:36Z","name":"Bayou Classic 32 Qt.","synopsis":"The Bayou Classic 32-Quart Stainless Steel Fryer Pot turkey fryer has a powerful burner with a high heating capacity, and it can cook a turkey up to 18 pounds in under an hour.
