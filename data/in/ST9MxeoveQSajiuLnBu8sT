The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/auto/best-in-dash-navigation-systems/\">In-Dash Navigation Reviews</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","The Jensen VX7020 is an exceptionally affordable in-dash navigation unit with built-in navigation and Bluetooth-enabled smartphone connectivity. It has a 6.2-inch resistive touchscreen. Like all the in-dash GPS units we reviewed, it can play CDs and DVDs. It comes with maps of the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Jensen uses iGO for its maps database, which provides 11 million points of interest, which is among the most available.","The iGO-powered maps database gives you an excellent navigation experience. However, in-dash head units are as much about smartphone integration as they are about navigation. Unlike some of the best in-dash units we reviewed, the VX7020 lacks Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the cutting-edge integration standards that allow you to use smartphone apps on the head unit.","It also lacks the ability to do HDMI mirroring, which projects the phone&#39;s screen directly on the navigation unit&#39;s screen. Most of the in-dash GPS units we reviewed have this feature.","However, the VX7020 does have some basic smartphone connectivity options, facilitated by Bluetooth. First, you can make and receive hands-free phone calls, using the VX7020 as a speakerphone. Second, you can send any kind of audio from your smartphone directly to your car stereo.","If you listen to music on Spotify, YouTube or offline, the Bluetooth connection allows you to send that audio to the stereo. Additionally, there is a dedicated Pandora internet radio app on the VX7020. You can control Pandora radio directly on the head unit (your phone streams Pandora and then sends it via Bluetooth to the VX7020).","The VX7020 lacks a traffic receiver, so unlike some competing head units, it can&#39;t check for traffic along your route. It also lacks the HD radio receiver that is present in many of the higher-end units we reviewed.","Jensen offers email customer service support, but it lacks phone support. The VX7020 ships with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"c218135f-c2ad-4d6e-8a67-e2f49cc81a7f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"98e6caba-5704-4703-89e6-7c771a68f7ee","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Jensen VX7020 is not loaded with features.
