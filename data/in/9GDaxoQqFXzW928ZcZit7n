This is more branches than <a href=\"/citizens-bank-review\">Citizens Bank</a>, though <a href=\"/lendingtree-home-equity-loan-review\">Lending Tree</a> connects you with lenders in all 50 states. Despite this, it offered excellent customer service with one of the easiest phone systems we used. This lender does not offer home equity loans, but it does have home equity lines of credit (HELOC) with competitive interest rates that follow the prime rate. It also offers the option to temporarily lock the interest rate.","Chase offers HELOCs with a good loan-to-value ratio, which you can find online. This is the amount you still owe on your mortgage divided by the current value of the property. You can find a LTV calculator and a home value estimator on the website to help you determine how much you qualify for. In addition, the online application asks for this information to make sure you qualify before you go through the process of inputting information.","The loan process online is neatly laid out, with a To-Do list you can download beforehand to make sure you have the information you need and easy instructions as you go along. There&#39;s no live chat, but there are help buttons if you are confused on an issue. In addition, you can call for information. Overall, the application process averages 45 days, according to the loan officers we spoke with. You can get the money immediately after the right of rescission period, which lasts 3 days after closing, if you want the money transferred to an account. Otherwise, you can get a credit card or checks. Checks can take three to four weeks to arrive, however. This is much longer than other banks.","You can discuss the draw period with your loan officer, which is the number of years you can draw money against the authorized loan amount. This is useful for longer-term projects, where you need only a certain amount at a particular time. You only pay interest for what you withdraw. The interest follows the prime rate and is capped at a higher ceiling than most home equity lenders set but which is much higher than the interest rates have gone in decades. However, you can request to fix the interest rate for a specific amount of time. There may be fees associated with this. <br/><br/>"]},"id":"720e87b6-a853-4227-b606-00cb1d77ab1a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"24de3c87-b99c-457f-bdcb-c72c179ae323","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are looking specifically for a home equity loan, then you should check out the other home equity lenders on our lineup.
