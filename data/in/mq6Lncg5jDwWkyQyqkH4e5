The uses of microphones don&#39;t stop at the obvious. Hundreds of teens and young adults are joining in with podcasting, Skyping, gaming walkthroughs, YouTube videos, voiceovers and other audio recording. Computers, laptops and iPhones are being turned into portable soundstages, complete with recording software and <a href=\"/computers/peripherals/best-usb-microphones/\">USB microphones</a>. Depending on the project, the kind of microphone you choose can be a deal breaker. There are two main types of microphones used for performing, dynamic and condenser. Below is a quick rundown of each with their best uses."]},"id":"2ae99c4a-a8a5-4a46-9675-3b1264fbf20e","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Dynamic microphones are what most people visualize when they think about mics. Dynamic microphones are big and bulky. They have a hard-ball on top made of strong material, usually metal. These mics can take a beating and still sound good. Inside is a spring-like part that can hand very, very loud sounds. Most dynamic microphones have a cardioid polar pattern. A polar pattern is the area around the microphone that picks up sound. With a cardioid pattern, a microphone naturally filters background noise, isolating the voice of the speaker for recording. This makes dynamic microphones ideal for solo performances. However, this can also cause your voice and other sounds to be more animated and less natural when played back.","Dynamic USB microphones are best for recording podcasts, voiceovers and music demos. The quick connectivity lets you digitally record your voice while blocking out white noise. Dynamic USB microphones are great for Skyping or using with voice recognition software. A desk stand helps keep the unit in one place so you sound clear and steady. Only one person can use a USB dynamic microphone at a time. If you want to host a guest on you podcast episode be prepared to pass the mic back and forth.","Condenser microphones are much more sensitive to sound. They pick up every little noise in the room. This is because condenser microphones often have an omni-directional polar pattern. This makes condenser microphones perfect for bands or singing groups that need to project several different sounds from multiple angles.","Condenser microphones also have a more flat frequency response. This means when sounds are projected they sound more natural and less distorted.","Condenser USB microphones can be used for recording solo music, podcasts and other audio recordings. Since condenser microphones are more sensitive to noise, they should be used with noise gate software or in a padded sound booth to block out unwanted sounds. Otherwise, keyboard clicks, oscillating fans and panting dogs will be heard along with your thrilling Dead Island Riptide walkthrough. Even your neighbor&#39;s lawnmower could find itself enshrined in your digital recording.","Both dynamic and condenser microphones are useful pieces of equipment for sound recording. The trick is knowing which mic is best for your particular project. Talking to professionals at electronic stores, music stores and through online forums is a good way to hear personal experiences and even some examples of work done with each mic before making your final purchase."]},"id":"bcf75a4f-b0cc-4cc2-b74b-5d95c6a0596e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7912","url":"/mynamic-vs-condenser-microphones","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-04T13:03:16Z","datePublished":"2013-06-04T13:03:16Z","name":"Dynamic vs Condenser Microphones","synopsis":"Rock concerts, presidential debates, comedy clubs, newsrooms and church all have something in common: All are places where microphones are used.
