Black and white print speed is about 9.0 ipm (inches per minute) and color is about 5.9 ipm.

They include credit card size, which is 2.1 x 3.39 inches, as well as 4 x 6 inches, 4 x 8 inches, 5 x 7 inches and 8 x 10 inches. This printer can handle paper that is letter size and legal size, and it can print on No. 10 envelopes as well. You also can create photo stickers with the Canon Pixma iP100. The paper tray can hold 50 sheets of paper.","You can use a computer to print your pictures if you want, but you are by no means limited to that option with this photo printer. This printer can interface with PictBridge, USB 2.0 Hi-Speed, IrDA, Bluetooth v2.0 and EDR4. With the Canon Pixma iP100, you have the flexibility to print straight from your camera or cell phone. You also can print wirelessly from PCs and camera phones.","If you want, you can buy an extra car adaptor and rechargeable battery kit so you can take your Canon iP100 on the road and keep printing photos as long as you would like. This small but versatile printer can easily turn out high-quality prints while resting on the seat of a car, poolside at a vacation spot or in the comfortable hotel room of a business traveler.","If you botch a picture as far as exposure or somehow end up snapping the shutter under less than ideal conditions, you do not need to worry about how your prints will turn out with this photo printer. This printer will not turn you into a professional nor will it work miracles, but its Auto Fix capability can help enormously as far as improving photos that were taken in subpar conditions.","The Auto Fix will place your photo into one of five categories: portrait, scenery, night scenery, snapshot with scenery and snapshot with night scenery. It will then make significant changes to improve the quality of the photo print you would like. The brightness, the color and the contrast all can be enhanced with this versatile and user-friendly device. In some cases, you do not need to do anything at all. On its own, the printer will adjust backlit and under-exposed faces and also ensure that the skin tones depicted match the people you have photographed.","You can have fun with this printer, too, when it comes to things like crafts. You can put it to work making greeting cards, helping with scrapbooking projects and even creating  three-dimensional paper projects.","This photo printer is ENERGY STAR qualified. In addition, Canon operates a recycling program for its products, although you do pay a small fee to get your devices recycled. The company’s Energy Green program helps reduce ink and paper consumption through the design of the company’s products, avoids using hazardous materials in creating the items it manufacturers and employs recycled plastic in its power supply castings."]},"id":"a20b51dc-77e0-4a20-a1bf-18e5310a5058","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ink &amp; Media"},"id":"a9843644-99e7-4c33-8ad9-e26f69c3e80d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/bDPAHAJbYpwnruFaKwPWVb.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"For all its useful qualities, this printer is a small and tidy package that you can easily stick into a tote bag, backpack, briefcase or even a large purse just before you hit the road.
