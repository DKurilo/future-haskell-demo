In our most recent testing, we assigned a volunteer to each of the dieting services and tracked their experiences to see how effective and motivating each plan was. The best online weight loss programs help you maintain healthy habits over a long period, so we considered systems that don’t force you to make changes so drastic that they lead to dramatic weight loss and subsequent weight gain to match it. When you need to lose weight, a good diet plan can help you achieve your goals for improved health. The best online weight loss programs offer various diet and fitness options as well as a multitude of trackers, which is why we looked for programs that provide a variety of tools and tracking abilities. <strong><br/></strong>","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We used a group of 10 volunteers to see just how well each program motivated and interacted with its members. Our testers were each assigned to a dieting service, and we had them keep track of their experiences in a dieting journal. We also tracked whether they lost weight on the plans. Each of our volunteers stayed true to their diets in order to provide a fair comparison across the board. Companies that helped our volunteers lose weight scored higher than programs that weren&#39;t as effective. Our volunteers provided us insight into their experiences with the plans, which we converted into a service satisfaction percentage.","Even if you have specific health or weight loss goals, you may have no idea what type of program will yield the results you&#39;re looking for, especially if certain diet programs have failed you in the past. For this reason, we were specifically interested in the motivational aspects of each service. Programs that provide more motivation through the community, weight loss challenges, tools and tips scored higher than programs that didn&#39;t offer these features. The number of tools and motivational features also helped us determine whether or not the price of membership was warranted. While we didn&#39;t score programs based on their membership fees, we did note whether or not they were on the costlier side of the spectrum.","<strong>What to Consider When Choosing an Online Diet Service</strong>","Managing how many calories you eat and how many you burn is the essence of a diet. While it is helpful to consider both food and fitness when selecting a diet, most people take in much more food than they can ever hope to burn off. That makes the food portion of each plan especially important. We looked for services that make it easier to eat right, with recipes, recommendations and personalized food plans.","<em>Program Pricing: How to Navigate the Numbers</em><br/>The price of online diet services varies widely depending on your subscription level, whether food delivery is included and on how many premium or consulting services you choose to add on. We found costs ranging from under $15 per month on the lowest end to more than $300 per month. ","Because services show membership pricing outlined by the day, week or month, it’s hard to make side-by-side comparisons. Also, some sites require you to input personal data to request a pricing quote, and most sites have promotions that lower the price per month if you sign up for a longer period. Although it takes some time, the best way to determine how much a service will cost is to communicate with service providers directly.","<em>Diet &amp; Fitness: Meal &amp; Exercise Plans</em><br/>Above all, we prefer the plans that helped our testers lose weight and motivated them enough to validate the price of membership. You&#39;ll want a service that has a good balance between encouraging good eating habits and inspiring daily exercise. Its tracking and reporting system should also be easy to use.","<em>Tracking Capabilities: Resources That Keep You on Track</em><br/>The best way to stick with your diet and know if it is actually working is to comprehensively track your progress. Any online weight loss plan you consider should provide tracking tools that allow you to record your weight, meals, exercise, nutrient intake and other factors. Reporting tools such as line graphs that display your weight loss are also important to help you gauge your progress and results. Most programs should provide a mobile app to help you manage your diet and exercise no matter where you are. Some diet programs include a mobile app to track both food intake and exercise. The best will also sync directly with Fitbit, Apple Heath and other <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html\">fitness tracking devices</a>.","<em>Community: Feel Like Part of a Team</em><br/>The support of others can play a vital role in losing weight and maintaining your health. Look for an online weight loss program that boasts a vibrant, active community you can participate in. Elements that mark a strong community include message boards, member blogs and weight loss challenges sponsored by the service to encourage and energize members. Online weight loss support can come from the service as well as fellow dieters facing the same challenge.","<em>Help &amp; Support: Can You Find It Online?</em><br/>Weight loss programs online should be simple to use, with websites that are easy to navigate. You should have no trouble finding and accessing various tools and features within the service, and customer service representatives should be easy to access by phone, email and live chat if you do have any questions. The best websites also provide FAQs, knowledgebases and articles to help you use the service and diet effectively.","<strong>What is the Most Effective Weight-Loss Diet?  </strong>","A $70 billion industry has grown fat off answering the question of what is the best way to lose weight. Scientists at the University of Toronto studied 59 weight-loss research articles and clinical studies from 48 randomized control trials to answer this question, and their conclusion was simple: The best diet is whatever you can stick to. The scientists found that each diet program produced similar weight loss on average. The success of the diet was based on how well the participants were able to adhere to it. Ultimately it doesn&#39;t matter if the diet is low-carb, high-fat, paleo, vegan or a point system like Weight Watchers; the most effective weight-loss diet is the one you’re able to stick to in the long term.","Thus it&#39;s best to avoid thinking about a weight-loss diet in terms of a temporary diet designed to help you get to your goal weight. Doing this only sets you up for failure. You’ll either fail to adhere to the diet and never reach your goal weight, or you’ll regain the weight after you’ve reached your goal weight. This is biggest reason why most people regain the weight they lost. Albert Matheny, a dietitian cited in an <a href=\"https://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/2016-07-29/scientists-agree-this-is-the-most-effective-diet-for-weight-loss\">article about the University of Toronto study</a>, sums it up perfectly, &#34;You didn&#39;t gain 20 pounds overnight. It took time. The same goes for losing 20 pounds.
