You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The <strong>Evenflo Serenade</strong> is the second of the two rear-facing <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seats</a> Evenflo manufacturers. This car seat, like its counterpart, the SecureRide 35 e3, offers all of the Evenflo safety features we like most, with one small difference. The Serenade doesn&#39;t have energy-absorbing foam built into the seat. Energy-absorbing foam is not necessary in a baby car seat, per se, but it adds another level of protection that we like to see. Despite the missing component, the Serenade has been crash tested and exceeds all federal guidelines.","Evenflo has taken the ease of securing a car seat to a whole new level with its SureLATCH technology. The company claims that your car seat&#39;s base will be securely latched in less than 60 seconds. Each side of the seat has two plastic connectors with grooves that match the LATCH system in your car. All you need to do is click them into place and push the car seat to ensure a snug fit. The base should move no more than an inch in either direction.","When you set the baby car seat on top of the base, there are dual side indicators that will tell you whether the seat is at the appropriate angle. To avoid installing and uninstalling the stay-in-car base in different cars, you can purchase additional bases on Evenflo&#39;s website. You can use this car seat with babies who weigh 5 to 35 pounds and are 32 inches long or less. This large range should comfortably seat your newborn until he or she is old enough to sit in a forward-facing car seat.","The Serenade also has Evenflo&#39;s slide-harness technology that allows you to slide the harness to a snug fit without having to rethread the belt. When in place, the harness should fit snugly over your child&#39;s shoulders, hips and between his legs. This five-point system is intended to distribute the impact of a crash so that no single part of your child&#39;s body receives the brunt of the blow.","Evenflo also makes it easy to adjust the harness when the child is in the car seat. A center-pull adjustment strap can easily be pulled down to snugly secure your child every time. For added comfort, a canopy is provided that is large enough to cover the length of your child. The canopy is much larger than competing car seats&#39; canopies, and we love its ability to completely block out the sun when your baby is sleeping in the seat.","The Evenflo Serenade&#39;s product page has information on the car seat and an installation video that guides you through each step of the process. We recommend reading the user manual, but you should also watch this video for further instruction. If you lose your user manual, the only way to download a replacement on Evenflo&#39;s website is to know your car seat&#39;s exact make, model number and date of manufacture.","There are FAQs on the website, but not a very good selection. If you have specific questions, you can call Evenflo&#39;s direct support line during standard business hours, EST. The company&#39;s 90-warranty leaves something to be desired, however. When every other car seat manufacturer offers at least a one-year warranty, 90 days is disappointing."]},"id":"dd93fef6-d7cb-4bbe-b514-1bba08ab3f6d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4b1f6ec4-7e5f-40ce-8147-75284225d3f3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Evenflo Serenade</strong> is a baby car seat that will comfortably transport your baby until the child is old enough (and big enough) to sit in a forward-facing car seat.
