The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-electric-lawn-mowers\"><em>Electric Lawnmowers</em></a><em> here.</em>","If you&#39;re in the market for a new electric lawn mower, the Earthwise 60120 deserves your consideration. The 60120 features a 24-volt removable battery, a 20-inch deck and 3-in-1 capabilities for bagging, mulching and side discharging.","The Earthwise electric mower rolls on oversized rear wheels that help maneuver the mower over uneven terrain. The wheels also feature ball bearings, which ease the effort it takes to push the mower.","The 60120&#39;s height can be adjusted between 1.75 and 3.75 inches using just one lever. The mower&#39;s ergonomic v-shaped handle will reduce the amount of pressure put on your wrists. However, the handle may be prone to wearing out quickly. In fact, many complaints we&#39;ve seen have been about this mower&#39;s short lifespan—something to be wary of.","Because of the steel deck and the size of the battery, the 60120 weighs in at just over 90 pounds. If you prefer to bag your cut grass, consider that the extra weight of a full bag adds even more heft to an already heavy lawn mower.","Its 24-volt battery is removable, making storing and charging the battery between mowings convenient. Battery maintenance is more demanding for this mower than for comparable mowers in our review. The battery’s charger can potentially harm the battery if it&#39;s left plugged in for longer than 24 hours. Plus, it has to be fully charged during the off-season every thirty days.","If your lawn is thick, or you grow your grass longer than average, consider that the 60120 has a weak battery compared with the rest of the mowers in our review. It is prone to getting easily bogged down in thick patches of grass, and it has trouble with a lawn that is three inches or longer. The harder the battery has to work to spin the blade through your grass, the faster the mower&#39;s battery is depleted.","Be careful about discharging the battery completely. Lead-acid batteries can suffer severe damage from losing all charge, which results in capacity damage – a problem many electric mower owners run into.","The Earthwise electric lawn mower is manufactured by American Lawn Mower Company based in Indiana. The company&#39;s website has very limited information regarding the 60120, but it does include contact information if you are looking for more guidance on this mower.","There is a retailer locator online to help you find the Earthwise distributor closest to you. Some distributors that show up on the list are Ace Hardware, Home Depot, Target and Walmart. We would like to see the owner&#39;s manual online, but we were unable to locate it on the website."]},"id":"501318a5-31b6-4deb-918d-140121c0c995","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"30f06606-9bb9-4393-ba60-34b4d7f7defd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Earthwise 60120 electric mower will not overwhelm you with its performance and specifications, but consider it a reliable option for small to medium-sized yards.
