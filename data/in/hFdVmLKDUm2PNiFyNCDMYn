However, several aspects of the software hold it back from being closer to the top of our lineup. While the user interface is simple in concept, Dxtory is not the easiest game recorder to use. There are so many options and settings to choose from that it can be difficult to find what you&#39;re looking for. Dxtory is a powerful and deep game recorder that, at times, becomes mired in its own features. That said, these options and settings can be a definite boon if you have previous experience with game recording software.","One of the best features of this game capture software is that Dxtory is capable of recording videos up to 120 frames per second (fps). High fps contributes to the overall quality of your video and gives it a smoother look. One primary advantage to a higher frame rate is that it makes editing videos easier. You should keep in mind that many people have a difficult time discerning the difference between 60 fps and anything higher in video.","Unfortunately, despite its high frame rate of capture, Dxtory has noticeable lag when saving a file during gameplay. The lag is brief, but any lag is enough time for your character to run off a cliff, get sniped or pull the agro of every mob in the surrounding area. This lag can be reduced if you own a high-end gaming PC, but players using a standard gaming PC will definitely notice it.","Dxtory has most of the support resources that are available with the best game recording software. Of particular note are the user forums. The Dxtory forums are the first place you should go if you have questions or problems, as the active Dxtory user community may already have the answers. You can also take advantage of the tutorials that guide you through Dxtory&#39;s tools. The user manual has plenty of useful information, but unfortunately, there isn&#39;t a FAQs page on the support website. If you still have questions or concerns after using these resources, the customer support team is available via email."]},"id":"63733087-1609-46f1-a610-b4731b616c1e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"74714e74-5f99-470a-a5c0-46952acaabcd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Advanced users will love Dxtory&#39;s powerful recording tools and bountiful settings, and the software&#39;s compatibility with different codecs is impressive as well.
