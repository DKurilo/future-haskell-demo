The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-compact-printers\"><em>Compact Printers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Canon Pixma iX6520 is one of two printers in the iX series. The iX6520 is far more compact and yet still prints at decent speeds just like the other model in the series. This printer can pump out black and white prints at 11.3ppm, which isn’t the fastest speed that we have reviewed, but it is still decent. The maximum black and white resolution you can reach with this compact printer is 600 x 600 dpi.","The color prints is where this mini printer stands tall. At 9600 x 2400 dpi this is one of the best rated printers when it comes to maximum color printing resolution. Using this printing resolution and the right kind of photo paper, you can really print some great quality photo prints. Of course, at the maximum color resolution you are going to lose quite a bit of printing speed. If you want to achieve the maximum color printing speeds of 8.8ppm, you are going to want to lower the color resolution on this compact printer.","This printer can print a wide range of media sizes. The print sizes it can manage are 4 x 6-inch photos all the way up to 13 x 19 prints. Though it cannot print 3 x 5 index cards, we were impressed by this printer’s media versatility.","Holding only 150 pages of paper, the iX6520 does not have the largest paper capacity that we have seen. It does hold up to five ink cartridges, which include yellow, magenta, cyan, black and pigmented black. It is also capable of connecting to your computer wirelessly, but otherwise you can connect your printer via USB.","The iX6520 is a much smaller design than its series companion and weighs much less. The iX measures 21.7 x 11.8 x 6.3 inches (W x D x H) and weighs 16.7 pounds. This printer has a compact design but it isn’t as mobile as other printers we have reviewed.","If you have any questions in regard to your printer, you can contact Canon via telephone or email. There are also downloadable user guides and drivers if you need to update your printer. This compact printer is compatible with both Mac and Windows operating systems and is backed by a one-year warranty."]},"id":"feb12fec-09af-4440-8c50-7a852cfafb75","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d6b2b008-f185-456b-beb0-d59d396895fe","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Canon Pixma iX6520 leads the way when it comes to color print quality.
