It also offers jumbo fixed- and adjustable-rate loans, as well as FHA and VA loans. Its Affordable Loan Solution mortgage allows first-time buyers in certain areas of the country (with some maximum income and loan limits, depending on the location) to put only 3 percent down without having to pay private mortgage insurance premiums.","Homeowners can refinance with traditional mortgages or cash-out refinances. BofA also offers fixed- and adjustable-rate home equity lines of credit.","<strong>Rates and Fees</strong>","Pay close attention to the rates listed on the BofA website, as they assume borrowers will purchase discount points – no rates are listed with zero points – making interest rates appear to be lower than other lenders’ advertised offers. Taking that into account, the bank’s interest rates are about the same as those of other large lenders, such as <a href=\"/citimortgage-review\">CitiMortgage</a>, but its APRs are higher. BofA is one of the few lenders to offer a <a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/closing-costs-calculator/?sourceCd=18168\">closing cost calculator</a>, which lets you estimate the cost of points, origination fees, mortgage insurance, escrow payments for taxes and insurance, and all third-party fees (such as appraisal and title insurance). The estimate can be a scary number, but that’s better than being surprised on the day of closing.","Bank of America Preferred Rewards customers can get $200 to $600 off their loan origination fee, depending on the size of their accounts.","<strong>Customer Experience</strong>","Bank of America has more Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaints (as a percentage of its loan volume) against it than even <a href=\"/wells-fargo-home-mortgage-review\">Wells Fargo</a>.
