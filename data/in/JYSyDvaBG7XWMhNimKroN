The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-weed-whackers\">Weed Whackers here</a>.</em>","Weed Eater revolutionized outdoor power tools when it introduced the world&#39;s first gas string trimmer in the early 1970s. This innovation helped <a href=\"/best-weed-whackers\">weed whackers</a> to become an everyday sight, second only to the lawn mower. The Weed Eater W25SBK offers a good design and light form factor, but it doesn&#39;t work with any attachments. Weed Eater&#39;s technical support is acceptable, but not as extensive as that of higher-ranked trimmers in our review.","Several characteristics define the Weed Eater W25SBK. It weighs only 10 pounds, making it the lightest weed trimmer in our review. This is impressive considering its 25 cc two-cycle engine, which gives the Weed Eater a respectable power-to-weight ratio and makes it easy to maneuver under porches. However, its maneuverability comes at the cost of durability. The engine needs an oil and gas mix to work properly. As you work, you&#39;ll be glad this yard trimmer has an anti-vibration design that reduces muscle stress. The spinning head on this unit comes with a bump mechanism that feeds additional trimming line with a swift tap when you need it.","A debris guard blocks fragments of weeds from flying all over you as you work. This grass trimmer comes with a 16-inch cutting swath, which is smaller than average. The design doesn&#39;t permit popular attachments such as edgers, brush cutters and pole saws. Because of this, it is ill equipped for anything other than occasional grass and weed trimming.","Weed Eater&#39;s technical support is acceptable, offering limited protection for this gas trimmer. A two-year warranty only guarantees the trimmer for two seasons&#39; worth of work. Hundreds of Weed Eater service centers provide repair assistance and spare parts. You can also call the company or use the online manual to troubleshoot. Weed Eater does not offer email support or an additional driveshaft warranty."]},"id":"8cbec05c-3695-4301-8507-a0f1cac84f5d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c6326825-b462-420a-b2d0-087add86380c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re looking for a trimmer just to trim grass and weeds occasionally, the Weed Eater W25SBK is an acceptable but not the most durable option.
