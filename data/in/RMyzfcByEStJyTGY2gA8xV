You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","After investing in that dream TV, you want a TV wall mount that is durable and offers the features and specifications you need for the ultimate protection and viewing experience. The Arrowmounts AM-FM108 is a strong TV mounting device that can hold 37-inch to 65-inch TVs. Additionally, the AM-FM108 is simple to install, and all the instructions and guidance you need are included with this mounting device.","The Arrowmounts mount is designed to fit most flat-screen TVs up to 65 inches. It can support up to 165 pounds, which is plenty for most TVs, as few TVs under 65 inches weigh anywhere close to that. Still, this is impressive for a full-motion <a href=\"/best-tv-wall-mounts\">TV wall mount</a>.","The AM-FM108 is made from heavy-gauge cold steel. This design gives the mount its strength and durability. One of the downsides to the full motion TV wall mounts is the larger mounting profile when the TV is flush with the wall. With this mount, the TV extends from the wall by about 4 inches. Even for a full motion TV wall mount, this is big profile. Rather than looking like a painting that hugs the wall, your TV looks like it’s floating off the wall, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing.","Arrowmounts markets this as a full motion TV wall mount, but it lacks the mobility of other full motion mounts. It can extend and tilt, but it lacks pivoting, which allows you to pan the TV left or right for optimal viewing. The tilting feature provides a 15-degree forward tilt and a 5-degree backward tilt. This is used primarily for glare reduction but also gives you the ability to get a better viewing angle. The arm extends the TV out to 22.5 inches, which is more than many full motion TV mounts.","Arrowmounts&#39; AM-FM108 offers all of the features we like to see in the best TV wall mounts. These features make the installation process easy and fast. The packaging includes all of the mounting hardware that you need for mounting to studs or concrete, so no extra purchases are necessary. It also features snapping wall brackets, but like the <a href=\"/sanus-systems-vmpl50a-b1-review\">Sanus Systems VMPL50A-B1</a> it lacks a built-in bubble level.","The Arrowmounts AM-FM108 is an excellent option if you’re looking for a sturdy full motion TV mount capable of supporting large flat-screen TVs. While it can extend out and tilt like the <a href=\"/videosecu-review\">VideoSecu ML531BE</a>, it lacks a pivoting feature that allows you to pan the TV, which is disappointing. It also costs more than many full motion TV wall mounts."]},"id":"4d474884-d627-4ea6-b5d5-0f62225bd5b1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69090","url":"/arrowmounts-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-02-24T15:49:21Z","datePublished":"2017-02-24T15:49:21Z","name":"Arrowmounts AM-FM108 Full Motion","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-02-24T15:49:21Z","id":"RMyzfcByEStJyTGY2gA8xV","meta":{"title":"Arrowmounts AM-FM108 Full Motion Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Arrowmounts AM-FM108 is a full motion TV wall mount that fits TVs up to 65 inches.
