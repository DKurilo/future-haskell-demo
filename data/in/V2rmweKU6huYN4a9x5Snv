You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","SmartyPig serves the very specific purpose of helping you set up a separate savings account. This <a href=\"/best-online-only-banks\">online bank</a> does not work well as a primary account or helping you diversify your investment portfolio. Instead, this is a wonderful option if you are trying to save up a fund for a college fund, vacation or any other event. There are no checking options with this online banking service.","This online banking service does not have any checking account options to be spoken of. There are no checks, ATM cards or debit cards available with this service. However, if you are looking for an online bank that helps you simply set up a secondary savings account, SmartyPig.com is a great option.","Using SmartyPig is very simple and it is unlikely that you will need to contact the customer service team. However, if you have any questions about online banking, the customer service representatives are extremely helpful. You can contact them through email or via a toll-free telephone number.","SmartyPig is very aptly named. Think of this online-only bank as a piggy bank. Just like when you were a child, you can use this account to set aside money to help save up for those extra expenses in life. One of the most popular and simple ways to fund your account is to have a small amount set aside from a primary account every month, or on another schedule of your choice. This will help make saving up money for the special events or a backup safety account that much simpler. You can also use the online bank to deposit funds in other ways including digital checks and other transfers.","The interest rate offered, even for the most basic accounts, is only average. You can expect an interest rate of approximately .1 percent. This is not a terrible rate, but it is also nothing to be excited about.","Withdrawing funds from this internet bank is usually done by transferring funds back to your original account with a simple fund transfer, which is free. However, if you choose, you can also have a check mailed to you.","SmartyPig does not have any long-term investment options. You can’t use it to get a loan or invest in the money-market. You’ll have to take those options elsewhere, which is why this bank is perfect for a very specific purpose. It really excels at helping you build a small nest egg of savings for yourself in case of emergency or for a specific purpose.","When investing or using any sort of online banking option, finding a safe and secure option is one of the most important features to look for. This online banking service is a member FDIC. This means that the federal government will insure your deposits of up to $250,000. Even if the bank fails, you will still be able to collect on your funds."]},"id":"20962ed7-2a7d-4a45-9c01-29a68fb13ef5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b4865f71-2954-46c6-91fa-116983fd87a5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["SmartyPig<strong> </strong>is a fantastic option to help build up a secondary savings account.

If you are looking for a very basic savings account, this could be a very appealing option.","***How we formulate the Benchmark Data:","Under the Benchmark tab labeled &#34;Online Banks&#39; Interest Rates,&#34; you will find the basic interest rate paid on a savings account for new customers. This number is not static and will change based on the amount you deposit, your current balance and special promotions the bank might be having. The interest rate we have displayed was obtained by contacting the bank to evaluate the interest rate on a new account with the lowest possible minimum balance.","The second Benchmark tab, &#34;Online Bank Interest Rates Compared to Major Banks,&#34; is a computation of the interest rate found at the online bank, as above, and divided by the average rate of major “brick and mortar” banks. The average interest earnings for these banks is currently calculated as .05%, and was derived by contacting the three major banks (Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Chase), and averaging their interest earnings rate for a similar account.","The Benchmark values found under this tab represent the ratio of each online bank&#39;s interest rate to .05% (the brick and mortar average). The value you see here is a product of that ratio, which is obtained by dividing the estimated interest rate found at online banks (the values in the first tab) by the average interest rate of the brick and mortar banks (.05). The banks that feature a larger Benchmark number than competing banks in our review provide a proportionately higher interest earnings rate on savings. The data used to compute these values is current as of October 2011."]},"id":"bfebe8da-e867-47df-8722-3ca592b862a9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53224","url":"/smartypig-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-30T23:52:14Z","datePublished":"2011-06-30T23:52:14Z","name":"SmartyPig","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"verdict":"We recommend this bank for a secondary savings account.","pros":["This online bank is terrific for setting up a separate savings account."],"cons":["They do not offer a checking account."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-06-30T23:52:14Z","id":"V2rmweKU6huYN4a9x5Snv","meta":{"title":"SmartyPig Online Banking Review - Interest Rates, Service & Security","description":"SmartyPig serves the very specific purpose of helping you set up a separate savings account.
