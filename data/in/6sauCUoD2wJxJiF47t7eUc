The speakers have an 89 dB sensitivity rating, which means they are efficient at turning amplification into sound, especially for an inexpensive speaker package. The tower speakers’ continuous power rating is 160 watts at 8 ohms, and the other satellite speakers require between 30 and 100 watts.

He told me the primary advantages are flexibility, upgradeability and true surround sound. “An entry-level AV receiver provides more inputs and versatility than what you’ll typically find in a sound bar, and provides true surround sound vs. virtual surround sound.” He also pointed out that even entry-level AV receivers offer acoustic optimization technology, which automatically calibrates home theater speakers to sound pleasant and natural in any room. Sound bars less than $500 rarely offer room calibration, and if they do, the surround sound output is a simulation rather than the fully immersive experience you get from surrounding your listening area with speakers. ","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","To test the audio quality of the speaker systems, we connected each to the same AV receiver and television and played an action scene from &#34;Kill Bill Volume 1&#34; for a panel of evaluators. Our panel filled out a listening survey rating each system’s bass performance, dialogue clarity and overall sound quality. We tabulated the scores from each of those important categories and issued a final grade for each speaker package.","Our panel of evaluators had a wide range of critical listening experience.

Since this is one of the most important tasks for a sound system, we decided to further evaluate those three speakers. To do this, we connected each system&#39;s left, right and center speakers to a speaker switcher, which allowed us to quickly change back and forth. This eliminated setup and breakdown time so we could do a true side-by-side comparison.","<strong>How Much Does a Home Theater Speaker Package Cost? </strong>","You can buy an AV receiver and speaker package with five satellite speakers and a subwoofer for less than $700, which is less than the cost of a high-end sound bar system. The installation process is a bit more involved, but the surround sound, connectivity and upgrade options are much better. We focused our comparison on packages that cost less than $500. One of our favorite packages, the Yamaha NS-SP1800BL, is around $150 and if you pair it with a $300 entry level AV receiver, you can significantly upgrade the sound coming from your TV’s speakers.","<strong>Important Things to Consider When Choosing a Home Theater Speaker Package   </strong><br/> <br/>Speaker Size<br/>Be sure to buy speakers that fit your entertainment room. A large theater room requires bigger, more powerful speakers than a 10 x 10-foot bedroom converted to an entertainment room. All the systems we reviewed come in different speaker sizes, allowing you to customize them to your space. Some systems include floor standing speakers while others only have small, cube-shape satellite speakers. Small cube speakers are easy to hide or mount on a wall, making them ideal for rooms where every inch of space is precious.","Subwoofer<br/>Speaker packages with a subwoofer have better bass response than those without. Check the RMS continuous power rating as it’s the best indicator of a sub&#39;s power and volume. Peak power is often an embellished specification from the manufacturer and isn&#39;t an appropriate indicator of the subwoofer&#39;s real output.","Amplification<br/>All the speaker packages we reviewed require external amplification. They must be paired with either an AV receiver or amplifier. If you already have an amplification source, make sure the speaker system you choose has similar power ratings to avoid damaging the speakers or amp."]},"id":"a714e2a5-f5be-478f-a3c8-801b35a946ff","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"9942b617-687c-446a-82a6-6c4942618423","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a
