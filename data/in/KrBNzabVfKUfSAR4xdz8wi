You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Yamaha HTR-4066 is a 5.1 <a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">AV receiver</a> with good functionality and an affordable price tag. It doesn&#39;t offer the extra conveniences of the best AV receivers, but it still has wireless audio capabilities and can be controlled remotely.","This home theater receiver produces 80 watts per channel at two channels driven, and it can power five speakers and one subwoofer. It provides plenty of power to watch movies at a very loud volume if you want to.","Many receivers can power up to seven speakers and two subwoofers. The HTR-4066 can power just five speakers and one subwoofer. The 7.1 or 7.2 speaker setup does provide a more immersive listening experience, but 5.1 is sufficient for most people&#39;s tastes.","This receiver comes with five HDMI inputs and one HDMI output. This is important because you&#39;ll want to run your Blu-ray player, gaming console and any other input source through the receiver via an HDMI input. Some of the best AV receivers have six, seven or even eight HDMI inputs, which is better if you plan to run a lot of inputs into the receiver.","It also has two optical inputs, which are helpful if you have older input equipment. Like most receivers, the HTR-4066 also has a host of legacy ports for your vintage input sources.","Although Yamaha does sell a Bluetooth adapter, the HTR-4066 does not come with one. This means that you can&#39;t use this receiver to play music through your surround sound system, at least not with Bluetooth. However, it does support AirPlay and DLNA, which allow you to send music to the sound system over Wi-Fi from your iPhone or Android phone.","You can also use your phone to control the receiver, using Yamaha&#39;s free app. This makes it simple to change settings and switch functions on the unit.","It can decode both Dolby and DTS codecs, so you&#39;ll be able to listen to surround sound from your favorite DVDs, Blu-rays and Netflix. It can also decode the lossless formats, Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD, so you&#39;ll get the highest possible audio quality."]},"id":"bd49ff18-970b-4c27-a6b2-b1eeb69130af","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4412fafc-f96f-4603-a69c-f8ab7a0d61b2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Yamaha HTR-4066 is an excellent, albeit basic, AV receiver.
