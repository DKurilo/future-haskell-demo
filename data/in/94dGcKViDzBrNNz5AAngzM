You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you live in an area with year-round pollen, you need a powerful <a href=\"/best-air-purifiers\">air purifier</a> to take control of the air in your home. Fortunately, the Blueair 650E is an air filter on steroids that eats harmful particles for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And it comes back for seconds.","However, the Blueair 650E wants you to know when it&#39;s working. It is one of the largest and loudest air purifiers we reviewed. Also, it uses two different types of filters with specific specialties: Its SmokeStop filter captures tobacco smoke, and the particle filter reduces pollen. Despite its massive size, we are impressed with the 650E&#39;s purification.","The Blueair 650E is a large-room air purifier. It would be unreasonably loud in mid-size or small rooms, especially since it lacks fan-speed controls. If you&#39;re throwing a party or trying to watch a movie, you&#39;ll have to turn the air filter off. This HEPA air purifier is so large that it comes with four wheels to help you move it around. The device also has an overly sterile, industrial design; it looks like something you would find in a hospital.","However, its ugly appearance and noise output are overshadowed by its ability to filter air. Even without a pre-filter to capture large particles, it has one of the highest clean air delivery rates (CADR) we&#39;ve seen. Part of its CADR number comes from the huge airflow of 490 cubic feet per minute. Few air purifiers are able to filter as much air as the 650E.","The Blueair 650E may be large and loud, but it offers healthful cleaning. While it uses an ionizer – a component that can produce ozone, which is harmful to the lungs –- it meets the California Air Resources Board certification for low ozone emissions. And it cycles an impressive volume of air while still meeting Energy Star requirements. Finally, it holds an Edison Testing Labs listed mark.","The Blueair allows you to choose between two filters. The particle filter is geared for pollen and other allergens. This filter contains three layers of particle-catching materials and can trap pollen, dust, mold spores and pet dander. The SmokeStop filter is great for removing gases and odors. Blueair recommends this air filter for rooms with heavy gaseous pollutants like tobacco smoke.","The 650E also comes with an air-quality sensor to help control the fan speed, and a remote control. After running through an operation, the air purifier enters sleep mode, saving energy and lowering the noise level. The filter monitor also helps you keep track of when you should change the filter.","Blueair offer a five-year warranty to protect the air filter and its parts. If you have any problems, you can look for easy fixes by downloading the user manual or browsing the FAQs. If you still can&#39;t find answers to your question, Blueair&#39;s support representatives are available by live chat, telephone and email during regular business hours. These representatives are quick to respond and will offer detailed answers to any questions you have."]},"id":"d78a7f93-ee7a-4356-9714-d2863eaa4a4c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9d560edc-3346-441b-a8fa-3ef3ae5c0438","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Blueair 650E is a powerful air purifier that cycles through air faster and more efficiently than many other purifiers available.
