You can buy a dedicated <a href=\"/best-digital-photo-frames\">digital picture frame</a> or a tablet that doubles as a photo display device. Both options offer you a convenient way to enjoy your photographs. It&#39;s up to you to decide which of these options suits your needs and budget.","<strong>Benefits of Tablets as Picture Frames</strong><br/>Tablets serve multiple purposes depending on your lifestyle. These small computers allow you to visit websites, create documents, edit photographs, read books, take notes and carry out a host of other tasks. Certain apps, like Photo Slides for Android tablets, can turn your device into an electronic photo frame.","Tablets work best if you need a tablet&#39;s functionality but lack the funds or desire to buy two separate devices. They also function well as electronic picture frames if you don&#39;t need to display your photos 24/7; when you use the tablet for other tasks, it no longer serves as a picture display.","<strong>Benefits of Dedicated Digital Picture Frames</strong><br/>A digital or electronic picture frame displays single photographs or full slideshows on an LED screen. Quality models, such as the Nix Ultimate Cloud, integrate with social media platforms and feature power-saving functionality to avoid unnecessary electricity usage.","The main benefit of a digital picture frame lies in its specificity. Unlike tablets, digital frames focus on displaying pictures rather than surfing the internet. As a dedicated device, you can display it constantly rather than setting it up each time you want to show off images.","Electronic frames require no extra apps or software to function as picture frames. You just follow the instructions that come with the device to set it up once, then load photographs as you wish.","<strong>Choosing the Best Photo Frame Device</strong><br/>Tablets feature dozens of applications, while digital picture frames do one thing well. Because digital frame prices have decreased significantly in the last decade, now is a great time to purchase one.","You should keep in mind that photographs consume significant hard drive space, which is why many wireless digital frames feature cloud storage and memory card slots, as well as internal memory. If you fill up your tablet with high-resolution images, you risk using up space for other files, documents and apps.","You should consider the power source as well. Digital frames typically operate via a power cord that plugs into the wall, while tablets function on a battery. The cord from the digital frame might be annoying, as might the charging plug for your tablet Â  the connections could get in the way of your view of the screen. However, if you want an attractive, framed image, you should consider a digital picture frame instead of a tablet.","Both tablets and digital picture frames help you show off your photographic skills. The gadget you choose will depend on your lifestyle and personal preferences."]},"id":"85b69c7e-c165-47d7-a402-3d3f27d48b25","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9552","url":"/digital-picture-frame-vs-tablet","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-20T17:35:53Z","datePublished":"2015-05-20T17:35:53Z","name":"Digital Picture Frame vs Tablet","synopsis":"Photos look great displayed in the home, and digital photo displays are a high-tech way to showcase your photographs.","review":{},"strapline":"Photos look great displayed in the home, and digital photo displays are a high-tech way to showcase your photographs.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-05-20T17:37:55Z","id":"Sq2YsoR9PtWo9RgG7usw59","meta":{"title":"Digital Picture Frame vs Tablet","description":"You can display photos in your home with a digital picture frame or with a tablet that doubles as a photo display.
