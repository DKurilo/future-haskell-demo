You can still read our original review below, but TopTenREVIEWS is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Viking Professional 5-quart<strong> </strong><a href=\"/best-mixers\">stand mixer</a> offers an easy-to-use design. It also comes with a powerful motor, 800 watts to be exact. It is also equipped with 12 speeds. With this kind of power, you will be able to mix most anything your family wants to eat. This kitchen mixer also comes with the ability to add more attachments, making it a good choice for those who enjoy cooking a variety of different foods.","We were frankly disappointed that a machine with such a powerful motor does not come with an auto-off feature. Unless you are hovering over the unit while it is mixing dough, you run the risk of possibly burning out the motor. Many of our higher-ranked products do offer this important safety component.","This stand mixer comes with 12 different speeds, including a &#34;stirring&#34; and a &#34;max&#34; setting. This allows you to begin mixing on a slower speed to prevent food splatters while the speed gradually increases to the &#34;max&#34; speed. This lets you mix and whip heavier batches of ingredients.","This food mixer comes in several colors, which is great news for those who are interested in adding some flair to their kitchen or for those who want their appliances to match their décor. The available colors are a bright red, deep black, clear white, stainless grey and silver.","This stand mixer comes with the standard three attachments: a hook, a beater and a wire whisk. The attachments are all stainless steel for easy cleanup. The 5-quart bowl for this electric mixer is also stainless steel and comes equipped with an ergonomic handle placed on the side of the bowl for easy mobility.","While reviewing this dough mixer we did find that there are a few cracks and crevices where food can easily become stuck, making it a bit more difficult to clean up. However, it also comes with a tilt-back head that locks into either the up or the down position. This could come in very handy when you are trying to clean those hard-to-reach spots. We were happy to find that this kitchen mixer comes with rear wheels that use &#34;Easy-Glide&#34; technology. This allows you to move this stand mixer around your kitchen countertop with ease.","This dough mixer comes with a user manual that is complete with recipes ready for you to try out. We were also happy to find that this stand mixer comes with a one-year warranty that covers both the motor and the housing of this appliance. We were disappointed that we couldn&#39;t find any FAQs. Viking also does not offer a live chat support option, but we were able to locate an email address and telephone number for questions that we had."]},"id":"f545a2c8-0cba-49aa-8fa5-528ec27820e3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"80c8bdf7-f7d2-4c12-8022-8c706b5589da","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Viking Professional 5-Quart stand mixer will help you create culinary delights for any size crowd of people.
