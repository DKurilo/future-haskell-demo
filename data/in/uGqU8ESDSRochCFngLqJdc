And a new home construction cost estimator on the internet will only get you so far; it won&#39;t cover everything. A lot of construction costs are often unexpected and forgotten in the planning process. Here are a handful of construction costs that can take you by surprise when you&#39;re building your new home."," ","<strong>Landscaping </strong><br/>Often when you&#39;re building a new home, the front-yard landscaping is worked into the cost and taken care of before you move in, but backyard and side-yard landscaping isn&#39;t. Landscaping isn&#39;t cheap, especially for homes with large backyards.","<strong>Sprinkler System</strong><br/>Along with the landscaping comes a sprinkler system. A small yard may not require a sprinkler system, but a larger yard would. A sprinkler system can be taxing and complicated to install, so hiring a professional might be a better option than doing it yourself   but it will add to the home construction costs.","<strong>Basement</strong><br/>If you&#39;re building a multilevel home with a basement, don&#39;t count on it being finished when you move in. On a new home, an unfinished basement is part of the deal, and the cost to finish it can be quite shocking when you add it all up. In fact, finishing a basement is one of the highest new home construction costs that is often forgotten or unrealized.","<strong>Fencing </strong><br/>If backyard fencing or fencing around the side of your home is something you&#39;re picturing as you draw up your dream home, remember that it won&#39;t be included in the new-home construction costs. Along with the fencing materials, installation costs can ensue if you choose to not do it yourself.","<strong>Light Bulbs </strong><br/>When you&#39;re building a new home, the days of free maintenance are over, and simple things such as light bulbs are no longer just a phone call or maintenance request away. Light bulbs are likely not included in the costs of the home. Although you may remember to have the electricity turned on before you move in, you may not have light if you haven&#39;t remembered to purchase light bulbs beforehand.","<strong>Windows Treatments</strong><br/>The first night in your new home can get awkward quickly for the neighborhood when you forget about the window treatments. Blinds and curtains are never a part of the new-home construction costs that are included in the home purchase.","<strong>Cleanup </strong><br/>As exciting it is to get all moved into a new home, construction crews almost never leave the home spick-and-span when they&#39;re done and the home is officially turned over to you. Cleaning up sheetrock dust and other messes that are often left behind can take some time and requires some cleaning materials. Although the costs might be small, it&#39;s one more thing to add to your list.","There are a lot of things to consider when estimating home construction costs. It can be a difficult task, but remembering those things that aren&#39;t included in the initial construction costs will make you much more prepared when it&#39;s time to move in."]},"id":"672eb2fd-a4dd-43ce-8dd5-19904eb07ad2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8859","url":"/7-unexpected-construction-costs-of-a-new-home","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"kira-terry","url":"/author/kira-terry","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Kira Terry","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"Lg9uFDyvy5KKTDvpstGsja","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-20T17:33:53Z","datePublished":"2014-10-20T17:33:53Z","name":"7 Unexpected Construction Costs of a New Home","synopsis":"Building a home can be quite the exciting venture, but there are a lot of things to consider when planning your new home.","review":{},"strapline":"Building a home can be quite the exciting venture, but there are a lot of things to consider when planning your new home.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-10-24T19:19:17Z","id":"uGqU8ESDSRochCFngLqJdc","meta":{"title":"7 Unexpected Construction Costs of a New Home","description":"New home builders beware.
