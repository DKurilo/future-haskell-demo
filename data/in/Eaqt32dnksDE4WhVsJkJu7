However, you do need to keep tabs on it, especially if you are an active trader.","Apps for tablets and smartphones have grown increasingly sophisticated and popular, enabling you to do market analysis, get tips and even make trades right from your mobile device. Many <a href=\"/best-online-stock-trading-brokers\">online stock trading platforms</a> offer a mobile version. Here are 10 of the best stock apps that aren&#39;t dependent on an online trading service:","<strong>Best Apps for Trading</strong>","<strong>Robinhood:</strong> Whether you&#39;re a casual or serious trader, you know that fees can get expensive. Robinhood allows you to make trades for free for U.S.-listed securities. The app lets you place market, limit, stop-loss, stop limit and good-till-canceled orders. The transactions are SIPC protected up to $500,000.","<strong>Betterment: </strong>Betterment is a robo advisor that does the investing for you. You begin with a simple questionnaire, and the Betterment app selects a portfolio for you. It charges a management fee that is significantly smaller than those of a traditionally managed account. The program offers automated deposits, tax-efficient rebalancing of investments and automatic dividend reinvesting. Your account is SIPC protected up to $500,000, and you can withdraw funds at any time.","<strong>Wealthfront:</strong> Answer a few questions, and Wealthfront, an SEC-registered investment advisor, selects one of 20 portfolios that suits your investment goals. You need $500 to open the account, and you can link your bank account to your Wealthfront one for automatic investing. It also includes a portfolio review service to evaluate your other investments and make recommendations. This service is free for accounts up to $10,000; after that, it charges 0.25 percent a year.","<strong>Acorn: </strong>Acorn takes your spare change and invests it in a diversified portfolio of over 7,000 stocks and bonds. For example, if you spend $3.79 on coffee, it takes 21 cents from your account. Once you have amassed five dollars, it invests that for you. You can add recurring deposits or one-time deposits. The account is SIPC protected up to $500,000. You can track your account and withdraw money at any time.","<strong>Best Apps for Tracking &amp; Analysis</strong>","<strong>Bloomberg: </strong>This app from one of the top financial news companies offers you news and market data on your smartphone or tablet. In addition to news articles and watchlists, you can watch Bloomberg Television Live or listen to audio interviews and analysis from around the world. It offers performance charts to track your holdings and the ability to identify leaders and laggers. You can customize the app and set alerts on stock positions.","<strong>Jstock:</strong> One of the most popular financial analysis apps, Jstock provides portfolio and dividend-management tools, information on 36 world stock markets, performance charts going back 10 years, world indexes and stock alerts. It offers simple moving average and exponential moving average charts for analysis. The premium app integrates with JStock&#39;s free market software online, offers a zoom tool, plus foreign stock portfolios and background stock alerts.","<strong>MSN Money - Stock Quotes &amp; News: </strong>This app keeps you in the know with financial news in real time from the world&#39;s top sources, from The Wall Street Journal to Bloomberg. You can track the major indexes from around the world and currency exchange rates. In addition, you can set up watchlists or use the app&#39;s budgeting tools, which include a mortgage calculator, currency converter, tip calculator, wealth estimator and retirement planner.","<strong>MyStocks Portfolio and Widget: </strong>This handy app provides news, streams real-time quotes and provides charts. However, it can handle multiple portfolios, convert portfolios into a different currency, and lets you import and export data in CSV from Google Finance portfolios. It offers open high/low close, candlestick and volume charts, with pinch-zoom, trackball and panning support.","<strong>Best Apps for Trending &amp; Tips</strong>","<strong>Scutify:</strong> Like StockTwits, Scutify uses social media to help you get the latest trends and sentiment about stocks you are interested in.
