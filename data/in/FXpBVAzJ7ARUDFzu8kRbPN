This model has a solid warranty, great customer reviews and built-in Wi-Fi that allows you to control the opener with the Genie Aladdin Connect smartphone app. However, limited smart home functionality and fewer included accessories keep the MachForce Connect from competing with similar openers from Chamberlain.","The Genie MachForce Connect is available exclusively from Home Depot for around $250, making it one of the more expensive garage door openers we reviewed, costing about $50 more than average. This is the only unit we evaluated that has a screw-driven lift system, which gives similar performance to belt-driven models with smooth and quiet operation.

The unit has an average rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars across 243 reviews. Positive reviews noted the opener’s speed, quiet operation, easy installation, powerful motor and built-in Wi-Fi. One criticism was that the activation code for the mobile app is on the back of the wall control, which means you need to get the code before placing that component on the wall. Other complaints focused on the instruction manual and problems connecting the unit to HomeLink devices in cars.","The Genie MachForce Connect can handle 7-foot-tall garage doors, but you can buy an extension kit for 8-foot doors if needed. For comparison, other brands we evaluated have extension kits allowing them to work with doors up to 10 feet tall or higher, depending on the brand.","Other than a timer-to-close feature and built-in Wi-Fi, the Genie MachForce Connect doesn’t have many extra features. It requires you to buy a backup battery and a wireless keypad separately. In contrast, both of those accessories are included with our top pick, the Chamberlain B970, which costs only $30 more. The MachForce Connect also lacks a motion sensor to activate lights, as Genie doesn’t make an add-on for this purpose."]},"id":"d4654c5f-6eea-431f-8dea-8512399f25e6","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/nc32FeKUBkL9eWKvcNHCTc.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/70328-genie-machforce-connect3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nc32FeKUBkL9eWKvcNHCTc.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"nc32FeKUBkL9eWKvcNHCTc","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nc32FeKUBkL9eWKvcNHCTc.jpg","alt":""},"id":"443e1040-0576-476b-9d6e-7b34eb5fd721","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can control the MachForce Connect through the Genie Aladdin Connect smartphone app. However, it’s not much more than another remote for your system, because it lacks any meaningful smart home compatibility.
