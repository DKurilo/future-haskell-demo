Despite the company’s numerous successes, even its best <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphones</a> tend to play second fiddle to Samsung’s Galaxy line. Indeed, the most popular LG phone thus far was probably the original <a href=\"/google-nexus-review\">Nexus 5</a>, and it wasn’t even branded with LG’s logo.","In the LG G4, the Korean company has created a star. It’s not the most powerful smartphone on the market today, and its battery leaves too much to be desired, but its camera has set a new benchmark against which we’ll be measuring smartphones in the future."]},"id":"8fd3190e-598d-4d87-b9ee-b0ec6e373db1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"fb91ef01-db0c-4ef1-823c-6e365c0699f2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/mHDiCsFSCmjm56TjBWudXn.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/67038-lg-g41.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mHDiCsFSCmjm56TjBWudXn.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"mHDiCsFSCmjm56TjBWudXn","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mHDiCsFSCmjm56TjBWudXn.jpg","alt":""},"id":"73f77ddb-db6f-4f5b-acc4-fbd66ef55f6d","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Aesthetically, not much has changed in the LG G4 from previous models. Its top and bottom edges are still bowed slightly outward in what has become LG’s signature silhouette. Its power and volume buttons are still, for better or worse, center stage on the back cover. The device’s build isn’t quite as premium in feel as Apple’s or Samsung’s offerings, but that’s down to the plastic cover – nobody has yet figured out how to give us a metal or glass backing that’s still removable. Leather is always an option, though you want to be a bit warier of overheating should you go that route.","On the software side, LG’s user interface strongly resembles stock Android but gets a few nitpicky things wrong. The notifications shade, for example, is bloated with both full quick settings and app notifications. This seems convenient at first, but you have to swipe the quick settings away if you want to act on notifications – dismiss alarms, archive emails and so forth. It’s a small change from stock Android, but it has the potential to annoy.","In short, the G4’s design remains as impressive – and easily nitpicked – as ever. If you didn’t like the button arrangement of the G3, it won’t do much to change your mind, but you might find you like it more than buttons along a phone’s edge."]},"id":"d651209b-b36c-4416-bfd9-ddf33786dd53","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"ba664276-2dfa-4d59-a1c7-fdb73ba0c135","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/VUSopyZSXSTfiMHvru5bpe.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/67038-lg-g46.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VUSopyZSXSTfiMHvru5bpe.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"VUSopyZSXSTfiMHvru5bpe","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VUSopyZSXSTfiMHvru5bpe.jpg","alt":""},"id":"727ecc85-ccb8-40ba-b5af-c29115876a6f","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is where the LG G4 shines. Boasting the best specs and some of the finest photos we’ve seen from any of the world’s top smartphones, the G4’s camera is arguably the best in the business.","The sensor itself is 16 megapixels, on par with one of LG’s closest imaging competitors, the <a href=\"/samsung-galaxy-note5-review\">Samsung Galaxy Note 5</a>. Optical image stabilization and laser autofocus come standard, as do 4K video and 60 fps 1080p video. The <a href=\"/apple-iphone-review\">iPhone 6</a>, with its 240 fps mode, still wins the slow-motion battle, but there’s plenty of quality here for amateur cinematographers.","The camera’s real triumph is in its still photos. LG’s ƒ/1.8 aperture gulps in light and makes for some very solid low-light shots, while outdoor photos are simply gorgeous – crisp, detailed and offering near-perfect color reproduction. Yet the true gem here is the camera’s manual mode and RAW shooting functionality. Controls for ISO, exposure, shutter speed, focus and white balance are all easily accessible, and access to the RAW image files means superb editing capability on your PC. True, you need to have some experience to take full advantage of manual shooting, but even in automatic mode, the LG G4 turns out great images."]},"id":"2676bd42-14e3-40a2-b34c-478da3fa9b0b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Camera"},"id":"14c99bb7-4db2-44b4-bf89-13164b8cf901","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/izXAYfMG9s7aipiDLiBR2n.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/67038-lg-g45.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/izXAYfMG9s7aipiDLiBR2n.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"izXAYfMG9s7aipiDLiBR2n","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/izXAYfMG9s7aipiDLiBR2n.jpg","alt":""},"id":"7280cc60-111d-4c12-a162-ee3077784f87","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As a general rule, the more CPU cores you pack into a phone – or any computer, for that matter – the better it performs.
