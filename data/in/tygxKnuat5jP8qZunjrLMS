Choose between four different operating modes that provide different combinations of music, sounds, underwater lights and sea life in motion. The familiar Baby Einstein Neptune characters move on the aquarium display to entertain your baby as she or he falls asleep.","This baby sound machine only has two distinct sound options: music and ocean waves. The lights and motion are used in conjunction with either the songs or the ocean sound profile, or you can play the sounds without the visual aid. There are only two volume settings. If you want more sound profile options and better volume control, the <a href=\"/munchkin-review\">Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System</a> has 10 high-quality sounds, including white noise and a heartbeat sound.","The sounds and lights run for 25 minutes, gradually softening every 10 minutes to help your baby sleep. Once the time is up, the Sea Dreams Soother turns off. There is no continuous play feature. If you want to turn the machine back on, an accompanying remote allows you to activate the lights and sounds from up to 15 feet away, so you can turn it back on without disturbing your baby. This is the only baby sound machine we tested that comes with a remote control. There is a button on the front panel that turns the machine on and off, so older babies can self-soothe.","The Sea Dreams Soother has a detachable strap on the back panel for attaching the sound machine to a crib. You leave the strap attached to the crib and detach the machine to take into a different room. It runs on four C batteries that are included in the retail packaging. Battery operation is an important consideration if you want to travel with a sound machine, but the Sea Dreams Soother is too bulky to fit in a diaper bag. This sound machine doesn’t have a port for an AC adapter, but an indicator light on the top panel alerts you when you need to replace the batteries.","<strong>Summary</strong>","The Baby Einstein Sea Dreams Soother has fun visual aids to compliment the lullaby and ocean sound profiles. It isn’t great at masking external noises, but the ocean sound is calming. The progressive dimmer and volume drop is a helpful and unique addition to the sleep timer, and you can use the remote to start the machine from across the room or let your infant restart the sounds with the button on the front panel. "]},"id":"5c7c2a22-947e-4245-b48a-99d63a758fb5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59485","url":"/baby-einstein-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-08T18:03:18Z","datePublished":"2014-05-08T18:03:18Z","name":"Baby Einstein Sea Dreams Soother","synopsis":"The Baby Einstein Sea Dreams Soother doubles as a crib toy and a baby sound machine.
