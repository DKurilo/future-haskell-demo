Offering droplet per inch resolution ratios of up to 9600x2400, the Canon Pixma MP500 delivers remarkable quality and definition to those high-demanding image and graphic prints, and yet can still reach print speeds nearing 20 pages per minute for color prints and 30 pages per minute for B/W prints.","The 2.5 inch LCD screen brings a feature common to photo inkjet and photo-only printers to the all-in-one category. This 2.5 inch LCD screen allows you to preview images before printing, while also providing the option of printing PC-free. The easy-to-use control panel provides quick-editing tools for quick-fixes like brightness, contrast and red-eye.","Experts praise the Canon Pixma MP500 for its quality and versatility. While it offers itself to a host of home, office and home-office needs, it also possesses those features necessary to meet specific tasks. Users like the Canon Pixma MP500 for its quality and efficiency. While many printers offer high resolution color and photo prints, virtually all of them do so with high-priced cartridge replacements in mind. With built-in cost saving features and an inexpensive individual cartridge-replacement system, the Canon Pixma MP500 stands alone as one of the most cost-efficient and consumer friendly all-in-one printers on the market.","With its high-grade features, ease-of-use and impressive speed, the Canon Pixma MP500 epitomizes everything an all-in-one printer should be."]},"id":"879f9911-d3e3-42df-ad46-3f87b71f1c49","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_6790","url":"/canon-0579b002-3512-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-06-16T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-06-16T06:00:00Z","name":"Canon Pixma MP500 0579B002","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":51,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-06-16T20:55:03Z","id":"RZjzLziMTm7wQpxCBZSYZF","meta":{"title":"Canon Pixma MP500 0579B002 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
