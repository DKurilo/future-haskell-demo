One of the bonuses of such a powerful native operating system is that it affords you all sorts of capabilities beyond GPS navigation. Once you detach the device from its magnetic mount, you can use it as a regular everyday tablet. It is Wi-Fi capable and allows you to take pictures as well as download and play music, podcasts, audiobooks and games. The platform is compatible with both Android and iOS and can even pair with additional accessories, like Rand McNally’s tire pressure monitoring system and wireless backup camera.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/68868-rand-mcnally13.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GsbmjpmAKZPZaiPZhftpMP.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"GsbmjpmAKZPZaiPZhftpMP","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GsbmjpmAKZPZaiPZhftpMP.jpg","alt":""},"id":"99f6a784-208b-4358-8aa1-ba921777a952","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Rand McNally has tons of information about the OverDryve available on its website, including some informational articles, product manuals and a FAQs section.
