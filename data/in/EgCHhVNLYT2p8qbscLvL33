as wired <a href=\"/best-backup-camera\">backup camera</a> systems go, the Rear View Safety RVS-770613-HD is a good product. It performs well, but it’s such a pricey investment that we are hesitant to recommend it. For smaller vehicles, you can find a much less expensive alternative, such as the <a href=\"/yada-digital-wireless-backup-camera-review\">Yada</a> digital wireless backup camera. Still, the RVS camera is worth the investment for a permanent, multi-camera setup for your RV or truck if you’re looking for an HD system.","The RVS system is specifically designed for large vehicles, including RVs, buses and commercial trucks. It comes with 66 feet of cable. Since it’s a wired system, the RVS doesn’t have the same issues with interference as some wireless systems we tested (some wouldn’t even work in Bluetooth-enabled cars), but it’s harder to install, so tack on the additional expense of a professional installation.","For our tests, we set up the system with some difficulty. It didn’t help that the product came with the wrong manual. Once we figured out how the main components fit together, it was easy enough to solve the rest. There are ports for up to four cameras, though it only comes with one. You can view all four feeds on the 7-inch monitor. The whole configuration is powered by a single wired connection.","Once installed and working, the RVS is a breeze to use. It comes with a remote that is uncomfortable to use because it’s so small and the buttons are a bit difficult to press. You can also use the clearly labeled buttons on the monitor to change camera views or screen settings.","The included heavy-duty camera has an IP68 rating, so it’ll stand up to the heaviest rain and even some immersion. It also has a wide operational temperature range, from -40 to 70 degrees Celsius (-40 to 158 Fahrenheit). The camera features 18 infrared LEDs and a 130-degree viewing angle for great rear blind-spot coverage.","The Rear View Safety RVS-770613-HD is a great backup camera system for large vehicles, but if your vehicle is smaller and has fewer blind spots than an RV, we’d recommend something a little simpler and less expensive. The RVS system gets expensive fast, with its high upfront cost, the cost of installation and the costs of any extra cameras you want to add on. But the expense may be worth it if you’re looking for a permanent multi-camera setup or wireless range are disappointing."]},"id":"5d276a77-598e-43a8-90b3-6bd984dd8074","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60117","url":"/rear-view-safety-091406-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-04T17:11:00Z","datePublished":"2014-08-04T17:11:00Z","name":"Rear View Safety RVS-770613-HD","synopsis":"As far as wired backup camera systems go, the Rear View Safety RVS-770613-HD is a good product.
