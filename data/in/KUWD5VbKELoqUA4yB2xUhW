The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 reviews on</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/kitchen/best-ice-cream-makers/\">Ice Cream Makers </a>here.</em>","Kids and the YayLabs! Ice Cream Ball have a lot in common: Both are tons of fun and require plenty of wet wipes for cleanup. This ice cream maker may look more like a giant hamster ball, but it is great for a group of energetic kids during park visits or camping trips. Instead of batteries or electricity, you&#39;ll need constant movement for at least an hour.","To begin making homemade ice cream, pour the dessert mixture into the aluminum cylinder inside the ball. On the opposite side, fill the ball with rock salt and ice. The ball leaks easily, so be careful not to overfill either side and twist both caps tightly. The ball is about 7 pounds when it&#39;s full, so shaking or rolling it is a real workout. Because it&#39;s so heavy, we don&#39;t recommend tossing or kicking it hard. However, this hard-shell model comes with a large inflatable cover that makes it easier on the feet.","When you&#39;re finished after all that hard work, the ball yields a quart of ice cream. We were tired from the constant shaking, rolling and kicking, but the thickness of this ice cream was impressive. The more you play with the ice cream ball, the faster the ice cream forms. After the recommended 15 minutes, thick ice cream begins to line the outer edge of the container with some creamy mix still pooled in the center.","Without immediate cleanup, the milk and sugar can make the ice cream maker as sticky as a toddler&#39;s face. For a spherical ice cream maker, the YayLabs! Ice Cream Ball is covered in ridges and cracks that trap ice cream. Nothing in this ice cream maker is dishwasher safe and scrubbing the inside of this ball may be a tight squeeze unless you have tiny hands. Rock salt is also prone to stick to the ridges as well, so expect another good workout when cleaning it.","Although this ice cream maker uses rock salt and ice, you&#39;ll get the best results by storing it in a freezer when not in use. The colder the walls of the inner cylinder, the harder your ice cream will be. The cylinder is narrow and deep, so scooping ice cream can be a challenge. Metal spoons can scratch the sides of the cylinder, but the ice cream is thick that a rubber spatula may be too flimsy. We recommend a plastic ice cream scoop or running warm water under the cylinder to loosen the mix."]},"id":"5b74fc71-2e28-422b-a3c2-0e85e8729771","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"854a4f9f-dbb6-4dda-b2e1-db6d4c392225","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The YayLabs!

Also, cleanup can be tedious because of all the ridges outside the ball that catch any milk and cream that may leak."]},"id":"0251680c-ee11-4b94-8623-1fec8c401044","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56435","url":"/yaylabs-play-and-freeze-ball-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-20T17:30:32Z","datePublished":"2013-05-20T17:30:32Z","name":"YayLabs!
