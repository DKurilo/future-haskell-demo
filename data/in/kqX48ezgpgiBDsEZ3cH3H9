You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The HP 375 is a leader in the <a href=\"/best-photo-only-printers\">compact photo printer</a> market with good quality printing, faster than average print times and more photo editing features than many other printers. Its compact design, relatively lightweight and Bluetooth capability offer true portability.","A standout feature of the HP 375 is its full color, larger than average 2.5-inch LCD screen, which not only pops up from the top of the printer, but also tilts a full 45 degrees as well to adapt to your perspective. Print from a computer or direct from a compatible digital camera or Bluetooth enabled device. Card slots support CompactFlash, SmartMedia, Memory Stick/Memory Stick Pro, Secure Digital/MultiMedia Card and xD-Picture Card.","Once the HP 375 has captured the images, it offers a wide variety of editing features. Crop, remove red-eye, adjust brightness and apply special effects like black and white, sepia tone, antique and photo sharpening. Photos print in 4800x1200 dpi for clear images and the HP 375 will accept a variety of 4x6 inch media. Print options include both full size images and 9-up thumbnails.","The HP 375 receives praise for its small size, ease of use and overall good quality. Users appreciate the broader media types available and its compatibility with a wide range of digital cameras.","The HP 375 offers more input options, editing features and media types than most compact printers. Small package, big value."]},"id":"caebf222-31dc-4799-b406-4d1d5576e54a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_12915","url":"/hewlett-packard-q3419a-9977-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-04-22T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-04-22T06:00:00Z","name":"HP Photosmart 375 Q3419A","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":40,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-04-22T15:47:05Z","id":"kqX48ezgpgiBDsEZ3cH3H9","meta":{"title":"HP Photosmart 375 Photo Only Printer Review 2017 - Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
