As we tested the monitors, we used their default settings, so the display control lock wasn’t enabled. When our reviewers tested this Planar monitor, they bumped the OSD controls more than once, which disrupted what they were doing. This interference is why monitors that house their OSD controls away from the bezels are better."]},"id":"610dbf5c-e4aa-4792-b169-cd864f09485f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Display"},"id":"80f6105a-6202-4eba-b5cb-d0c9b6e4456c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/dDkf3NQby2zJbbhZ4Hqko6.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/69458-planar-pct22356.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dDkf3NQby2zJbbhZ4Hqko6.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"dDkf3NQby2zJbbhZ4Hqko6","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dDkf3NQby2zJbbhZ4Hqko6.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c1128fac-7221-4b95-945c-c60a1c83e196","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Planar PCT2235 ranked as about average for display quality in our testing. It has better color accuracy than the Acer T232HL, our top pick, but its response time of 14 milliseconds was the slowest in our review. A fast response time means the pixels can change quickly enough to keep up as high- definition games and videos change from frame to frame. A short response time also prevents ghosting, which occurs when images linger one frame to the next in fast-paced sequences. Touchscreens tend to have slower response times than standard monitors, but the PCT2235’s is outside the norm.","The monitor’s input lag, or the time it takes for information to arrive in the center of display, is good compared to the other touchscreen displays in our review. All the monitors we tested fell into two groups: slow or fast, with none falling in between. The slow group consistently tested in the 15 to 16 millisecond range, while the fast group received scores between 10 and 11 milliseconds. The Planar PCT2235 had an approximate time of a 10.6 milliseconds. The more quickly information can arrive on the screen the better. "]},"id":"c5463d88-9c20-4f64-b538-cf021c1af7f3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"f0d0d476-c524-474d-9072-18c80f58126f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The U-shape stand makes it easier to access the ports than with some of the other displays in our review.  But because of the thin bezel design, the ports are closer to the work surface, which places a little pressure on the cables and makes it difficult to use port adapters.","The touchscreen display has both an HDMI and a DisplayPort hookup as well as an analog VGA port. Neither of the Planar models we reviewed feature USB 3.0 ports, instead opting for USB 2.0.
