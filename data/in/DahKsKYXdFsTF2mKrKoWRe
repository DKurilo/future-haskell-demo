They continue this trend with their MM 500-X <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">Bluetooth headphones</a>. Out of the box, you will find these headphones are easy to pair with your Bluetooth-enabled devices, and the large buttons make it even easier to navigate through your music. The noise-cancelling feature isn&#39;t as good as we thought it would be, considering what Sennheiser normally offers in this area, but the bass hits harder than many other headphones we looked at, and the sound quality is outstanding.","The MM 500-X headphones use apt-X audio encoding, which delivers wireless audio quality that is indistinguishable from the highest quality wired connection. This only works if your sound source also supports apt-X. However, even with non-compatible sound sources, we were able to hear intact audio from many different types of music, in enough detail to distinguish individual instruments. Bouncing between wired and wireless, you will be hard-pressed to hear any meaningful difference with the music.","Sennheiser also includes their NoiseGard technology with these Bluetooth stereo headphones. This is your basic active noise-cancellation feature that uses an external microphone to help drown out ambient, outside noise. NoiseGard on the MM 500-X headphones provides noise isolation that is average at best, especially compared with other Sennheiser noise-cancelling headphones. The 500-X headphones do block some noise, but we were able to hear some normal-level conversations and other sounds. However, what the 500-X headphones lack in noise isolation, they make up for with pristine sound.","These Sennheiser headphones are some of the best-fitting and most comfortable Bluetooth stereo headphones we reviewed. The cushion wraps completely around your ear, no matter the size, and you won&#39;t experience any listener&#39;s fatigue. All of the function buttons are on the right earcup. There is a multi-function button you use to answer phone calls and pause or play songs, as well as skip and volume buttons. The Bluetooth button is also located on the lower edge of the right cup. The battery lasts for up to 10 hours of listening and 20 hours of talk time.","The MM 500-X headphones have a two-year warranty, and you can contact Sennheiser by phone or email if you run into any issues with your device. We experienced only short wait times when calling and long response times when sending and receiving emails. You can download user&#39;s manuals and see what others are saying in the forums on Sennheiser&#39;s website."]},"id":"63c68c81-355f-42a8-8e5d-3170c64e2fa5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b4966788-a5e4-4ded-85c5-14ef5aebe1e8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are looking for a quality set of Bluetooth stereo headphones that don&#39;t cut corners with audio, the MM 500-X headphones from Sennheiser are an excellent option.
