It was also very easy to use, maintain and maneuver. It’s packed with features that will make it easy to maintain any home, especially one with pets; however, its high price tag may be too high for some budgets. ","The ProHeat 2X is designed to offer an option for quick pet cleanups in addition to a normal <a href=\"/best-carpet-cleaners\">carpet cleaning</a> experience. When operating as a general cleaning tool, you simply mix cleaning solution in the water tank, run the machine over carpeting, and draw the water out. It lifts stains and removes hair and dirt easily. You can also choose to use the deep clean mode, which employs plenty of water. It’s important to note that this can make it take longer for your carpet to dry, though. There is also the express clean mode, which can usually dry in about one hour.","The machine is designed with a special device to hold pre-treating solution that you can squirt directly onto pet stains and spots by just pressing your foot onto a pedal.","The brush is made of 12 alternating rows of powerbrushes, so as it rotates it can loosen ground-in dirt and grime. This ProHeat  2X  has an 11-inch cleaning path, which is about average.","You get a generous 25-foot power cord with this carpet cleaner, so you won’t have to keep plugging and unplugging it into electrical sockets as you work. This machine also sports an 8-foot hose for attachments, which can help you reach awkwardly placed areas that get dirty.","The Bissell ProHeat 2X Revolution Pet weighs in at 19 pounds, which is just a bit over average for the carpet cleaners in our comparison. However, moving it from room to room is relatively easy, since it has a carrying handle.","You can attach the 2-in-1 pet upholstery tool and clean couches, chairs and other places where your pets may have left paw prints and fur. Using its dry mode, you can clear away any hair, visible dirt and then, if you choose, can change to the wet mode for deeper cleaning. You can also use this carpet cleaner and a helpful attachment to clean stairs.","Bissell backs this carpet cleaner with a five-year warranty, which is longer than any other cleaner in our review. If you run into problems, you can contact Bissell via email or phone, and you can check the company website to find a service center near you."]},"id":"e9600f15-22a9-4ec4-b7de-80733963f7b2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52715","url":"/bissell-proheat-2x-healthy-home-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-05-02T20:03:55Z","datePublished":"2011-05-02T20:03:55Z","name":"Bissell ProHeat 2X Revolution Pet","synopsis":"The Bissell ProHeat 2X Revolution Pet tied for the second best in our stain removal tests.
