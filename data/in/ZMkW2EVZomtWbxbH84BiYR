You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Many high-tech cars roll off dealership lots with a big bag of tech goodies. Among them are in-dash monitors. These monitors allow you to install various third-party devices into and onto your vehicle. If the new tech-laden automobile you bought lacks a <a href=\"/home/auto/best-backup-camera\">rear view camera</a>, consider purchasing the Sony XA-R800C. It&#39;s a quality back up cam that&#39;s compatible with a variety of in-dash monitors and displays. It&#39;s easy to install and captures high-quality video.","When you purchase the Sony XA-R800C, you&#39;ll find the camera and 3 meters of RCA cable. Installation isn&#39;t too complicated; however, you want to make absolutely certain you don&#39;t accidently damage your vehicle&#39;s other electronics. Sony provides a list compatible in-dash displays. If your vehicle does not possess an in-dash screen, Sony&#39;s store offers a variety of displays designed to work with the XA-R800C. Keep in mind that you&#39;ll have to install these displays yourself as well, which complicates the whole process. You may want to take at look our side-by-side comparison chart for a back up camera that comes with its own monitor.","The images produced by the Sony XA-R800C come through on your display at a resolution of 510 x 492 pixels. While this is by no means high definition, it&#39;s sufficiently large to see any objects and obstacles that you may miss in your rearview mirrors. It also serves as an excellent parallel-parking assistant. A camera mounted on your vehicle&#39;s rear gives you a much more accurate visual of how far your back bumper is from the car behind you. This is especially true in trucks and SUVs because, let&#39;s face it, the blind spots on those vehicles can be massive.","Another spec that goes a long way to alleviating large blind spots is the Sony XA-R800C&#39;s viewing angle. At 138 degrees, this back up camera allows you to see everything behind you in full detail. This helps for not only backing up and parking, but also in everyday driving. For example, we&#39;ve all been in the situation of changing lanes on the freeway and had to swerve back into our lane because we almost hit a car in the other lane. Not because we were being unsafe, but because they were in that sweet spot behind our driver&#39;s side bumper where it is simply impossible to see them. The Sony XA-R800C provides you with a real-time picture of this area. This could potentially prevent a high-speed accident.","As with every product it produces, Sony provides a wide array of help and support options. On top of its standard one-year limited warranty, the company offers telephone and online technical support. The number is easy to find, and its call center reps do their level best to help you with any problems you might have. You also have the option to email the company or live chat with a representative directly on Sony&#39;s website."]},"id":"891c5ab0-3b98-4679-ba6f-2531459d4814","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3c1dc4d9-ed05-447b-8e8d-e12229081ea8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When all is said and done, the <strong>Sony XA-R800C</strong> is a good camera if you already have an in-dash monitor or display installed in your car.
