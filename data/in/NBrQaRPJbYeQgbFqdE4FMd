How do you know which type to get? Do you buy a <a href=\"/best-mini-projectors\">mini projector</a>, such as the <a href=\"/m2-micro-projector-review\">M2 Micro Projector</a>, <a href=\"/best-mini-projectors\">Acer K11</a> or <a href=\"/best-mini-projectors\">Optoma PK301 Pico</a>, which costs less yet has limitations when it comes to the image or do you shell out a lot more money for a full sized projector and get the picture quality that is spectacular? Here we discuss the advantages to both the mini projectors and full-size projectors to help you decide which one better suits your needs.","<strong>Mini Projector</strong><br/>By the name alone you can determine the leading feature of these mini projectors; they are small, pocket sized, micro. This means you don&#39;t have to worry about trying to lug them around with you when you travel. The majority of these pocket projectors weighs less than a pound and fit easily into your shirt pocket. This is a great advantage when you don&#39;t have much space to pack or have a weight limit to consider.","Another advantage to these mini projectors is many of them come with a built-in rechargeable battery. This means you don&#39;t have to worry about having an extension cord or outlet to run your presentation. The micro projectors also have a long-lasting lamp life, upwards of 30,000 hours, which is a cost saver in the long run since replacement lamps can be pretty pricey. Overall these mini projectors on the high end are less than $500, and many are closer to the $400-$300 range.","One of the limitations to these is they just don&#39;t have the space for all of the components to make a bright image with a clear contrast. This isn&#39;t bad to work with, but it does mean the room needs to be darker for the mini projectors than the full-size projectors. So that makes these little guys more suited to a dim conference room than a well-lit convention center.","<strong>Full-size Projectors</strong><br/>These have amazing picture quality with high brightness, resolution and contrast ratio. They can also project larger images greater distances. These are perfect whether you are in a dark conference room or trying to draw attention to your booth at a convention. There are several different styles to choose from as well, including LCD, DLP and LCoS. Between all of the manufacturers and styles, you are sure to find a product that will suit your needs.","There are two limitations to these pint-sized products. The first is the size. For such a high-quality picture you need space to put all of the components. The average weight is between 16 and 25 pounds. This isn&#39;t something that you can just toss in your luggage or carry with you all day. The other limitation is the cost. For a projector with a high-quality picture you are looking at spending $1,000 if not closer to $3,000.","If you are working on a budget and are only expecting to make presentations in close company, the mini projector is the way to go Â  especially if you need something portable. If you need to work in a brighter environment or want an extra high-resolution picture, you will want to spend the extra money and go with a full-size projector."]},"id":"0718c1be-fa1c-4db6-a198-fd072f191345","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5362","url":"/mini-projector-or-full-size-projector-which-one-should-you-get","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"emily-younker","url":"/author/emily-younker","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Emily Younker","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"VfHp7pxJMR2v9xyBcnugUm","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-01-06T21:54:33Z","datePublished":"2011-01-06T21:54:33Z","name":"Mini Projector or Full-size Projector: Which one Should you Get?","synopsis":"Buying any kind of projector is a sizable investment.
