for a <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-laptop-coolers\">laptop cooler</a>, it’s often hard to find one that works equally well for gamers and home or business users. While gamer-centric models often provide optimal cooling performance, their sizes and bulky designs can be a poor fit for professional environments like an office. The Thermaltake Massive TM manages to effectively split the difference between cooling performance and appearance. It is a laptop cooler with a great combination of solid specs and unique features. Of all of the products we reviewed, the Thermaltake is the only cooling pad to include an automatic cooling mode.","This mode uses four, repositionable sensors that detect heat emanating from spots on the underside of your laptop. You can set a maximum heat for any one of these sensors, and once your computer reaches that temperature, it activates the cooler&#39;s fans. This unique feature, in combination with powerful fans and a solid design, makes the Thermaltake Massive TM one of the best laptop coolers available, as well as our Top Ten Reviews Silver Award winner."]},"id":"1e2e451a-2af1-4ba5-a578-fcacad6372c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"9cdbe3b6-5332-4870-a5ed-db19aa0f0394","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/dD4Z9hBjEyhk4sp8dJSshN.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/62604-thermaltake-massive-tm2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dD4Z9hBjEyhk4sp8dJSshN.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"dD4Z9hBjEyhk4sp8dJSshN","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dD4Z9hBjEyhk4sp8dJSshN.jpg","alt":""},"id":"a37a628e-37c8-47ba-9a3b-5807ae250bcd","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Massive TM uses two fans to circulate air at 61.27 CFM. On paper, it might seem like a step down from higher-end models that sport three to four fans, but the Massive has efficient airflow. While a few of the laptop cooling pads we reviewed reached upwards of 70 CFM, the Massive TM is still on the upper end for laptop coolers. Most high-end models reach around this circulation range and ensure your laptop remains cool.","Fan noise can be distracting while you work or game on your laptop. At 31 dBA, the Massive TM&#39;s fans are fairly quiet. Although they generate slightly above-average noise levels, they&#39;re not loud enough to bother most users. Like most coolers, power is supplied to the Thermaltake via a USB cable that plugs directly into your laptop. To compensate for this, the pad has an additional USB port you can use to connect any of your USB peripherals."]},"id":"23584255-da8b-4774-91e5-9ae44bc81d24","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"2d62f1c8-2eb8-40c3-b2b3-84a49faeb00f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/3UegxtuFEP3Da4b6nC9fPb.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Massive TM’s design puts the controls front and center.

Each of the pins can be calibrated horizontally to monitor separate portions of the laptop and ensure it does not overheat during extended sessions.","The cooling pad’s outer shell is mostly made of plastic, but it has a sleek aluminum top that makes it durable. The brushed panel’s grille allows for effective circulation and airflow under your laptop. The Massive’s aluminum centerpiece is a strong feature – at this price point, most coolers rely on cheap or thin metal mesh and plastic that can feel flimsy and lightweight.","The Massive isn’t quite as adjustable as some of the other laptop coolers we reviewed, but you can adjust its height. You adjust the height using cleverly designed feet that can stow flat or fold out twice, giving you three height options. However, there are no rubber grips or fold-out supports to keep your laptop in place.
