The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-electric-razors\">Electric Razors</a> here.</em>","The Philips Norelco 1150X rotary head electric razor is packed full of features and reaps the benefits of a well-designed handle and head. With a sleek look that almost makes you feel like you&#39;re in the future, this electric razor will add to the aesthetics of your bathroom. From the ergonomic handle to the three rotary heads, the 1150X is designed to make shaving a more comfortable experience. The placement of each blade on the heads ensures that each stroke will cut facial hair evenly and accurately.","The more hair you can shave off your face, the longer you can wait before you have to shave again. This electric razor features a design that lifts hairs up in order to cut them at a level that is normally below your skin. Essentially, a smaller blade catches hairs ahead of the cutting blade and the forward motion pulls the hairs up and out of their follicles a little bit. The result is a smooth, fast shave that lasts longer than if you only cut the hair at your skin&#39;s surface. After the cutting blade shears the hairs, they return to their normal positions.","The 1150X makes no distinction about whether you use shaving cream, or even water. This electric shaver is designed to let you shave any way you want to. You can shave with a dry face or with gel. The result is the same: a close shave. The handle on this electric razor provides you with ample grip, which helps with handling.","If you are worried about how well the 1150X will handle the curves and contours of your face, you don&#39;t need to be. This electric razor&#39;s head is able to pivot and the blades themselves have considerable mobility as well. The best electric shaver has the ability to give you a close shave without irritating your skin. The 1150X does its best to live up to that by following the curves and contours of your face, resulting in reduced pressure and irritation.","This electric razor needs 60 minutes to charge and the battery life is as long as 40 minutes. With 40 minutes, you can shave and then use the trimming tool to sharpen up your sideburns or other hair."]},"id":"0b3130b5-8fd7-49a2-9964-ab0e5f6e5005","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58048","url":"/philips-norelco-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-30T19:59:58Z","datePublished":"2013-10-30T19:59:58Z","name":"Phillips Norelco 1150X","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
