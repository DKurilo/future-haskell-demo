This is especially important when you buy the Electrolux Oxygen Ultra, which uses an always-on ionizer in conjunction with an odor-catching carbon filter and allergen-catching HEPA filter. Ionized air can damage lungs and exacerbate breathing problems. If you have healthy lungs but want to remove foul odors and capture allergens, the Oxygen Ultra gives you all the filtration capabilities you need.","When using an electromagnetic air purifier, the best operation habit is to use it while you are out of the house. Unfortunately, the Electrolux Oxygen Ultra lacks an operation scheduler and timer. Instead, it has a night mode that sets the air purifier to its low settings when it is dark. Even with the night mode, we recommend only using the air filter while you are out of the house. Charged air can damage even healthy lungs, so you should not run the Oxygen Ultra 24/7.","This air purifier is certified by the California Air Resource Board for low to no ozone emission. To get this certification, an air purifier cannot produce more than 50 parts per billion of ozone. However, we had no way of testing the exact level of pollutants escaping the air filter.","The Electrolux Oxygen Ultra comes with an air-quality sensor and remote control. The air-quality sensor adjusts the fan to best filter pollutants from the air. We like the convenience of operating the Oxygen Ultra from a distance with the remote. A filter monitor tells you when you have to change the carbon and HEPA filters.","This air purifier has a five-year warranty for damages or defects. Of course, this warranty is limited to the first buyer of the air purifier. From Electrolux&#39;s website, you can look up the FAQs section for quick help. However, you cannot download a new owner&#39;s manual. If you need a new manual or personal help, you can call or email support representatives."]},"id":"8120e6f2-8848-496c-89e4-d16212ecd4db","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b8fff5e0-b722-45dc-ad84-838cd3913f9a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Electrolux Oxygen Ultra is an electromagnetic air purifier with good filtration capabilities, but its always-on ionizer could damage lungs or exacerbate airway problems.
