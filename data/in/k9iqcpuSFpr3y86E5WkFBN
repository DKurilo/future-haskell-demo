You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Cuisinart has several <a href=\"/best-toasters\">toasters</a> on the market, one of which is the Cuisinart CPT-170. This toaster offers a timed countdown and specialized controls.","At one and a half inches thick each, this Cuisinart toaster’s two slots are capable of toasting several types of breads. The slot’s wide opening can easily fit a bagel slice, English muffin, croissant, waffles or other frozen breads. This toaster is also able to warm and cook toaster pastries. The toaster is designed to heat both toaster slots during a cycle, but you can lower the shade selector to a lighter setting if you&#39;re toasting just one slice of bread. A handy timed countdown located on the front of the toaster will let you see when your toast will be completed.","On the very front of the 2-Slice Toaster you’ll find every control needed to customize your toasted breads. A dial-style shade selector lets you adjust the color level of your toast from one to six. The other controls each have an accompanying LED light next to them to indicate when one is selected. You can choose to defrost a frozen item, reheat a previously cooked slice of bread or cancel the current toast cycle. Our favorite feature is the bagel setting. When the bagel option is selected, place your bagel with the cut side facing into the toaster. The toaster will then toast the inside or cut part of the bagel and warm the outside. There&#39;s a high-lift lever so you can remove the bagel without touching the warm toaster.","Cuisinart shoots ahead of the competition with its warranty. While competitors offer a measly one-year warranty, Cuisinart guarantees their product for three years. If during that time you run into problems, Cuisinart will either replace the unit or repair it. Three years is a very long time, and they suggest (and we agree) that the best way to ensure your toaster is under warranty is to fill out the included registration card. Lack of a registration card doesn’t mean you won’t be serviced; it is just an efficient way to verify the original date of purchase. If you don’t have proof of purchase date, the date of manufacture will need to be within the last three years.","Additional support can be found on the Cuisinart Countdown Toaster’s product page. Here you can find a user manual, parts and accessories and warranty details. If you need technical support, they also have a toll-free number you can call."]},"id":"00880e9f-4f1e-4544-b80e-1218388d0fa5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"49f44a7a-9176-4d89-9386-bb46d3ed13f7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Compact in size but large in options would be a good way to describe the Cuisinart CPT-170.
