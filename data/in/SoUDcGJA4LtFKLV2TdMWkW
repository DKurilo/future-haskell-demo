DriverScanner is one such product. It performed well enough in our tests and has the sort of features we demand from our driver checkers, but it lacks an outstanding edge.","When we ran the program through its paces on our test machine, DriverScanner identified and recommended updates for 19 devices – just over half of the 36 outdated drivers we knew to be present. Many of the drivers it missed were unimportant, such as old peripherals we hadn&#39;t used in some time. It suggested updates for most of the critical components in our system, including the video card and the Ethernet and hard driver controllers. But DriverScanner failed to spot the audio controller update the system needed, as well as several motherboard drivers that its competitors found with ease.","Despite its merely passable test performance, DriverScanner&#39;s feature set is as solid as those of the best driver updaters out there. You can scan your system for free before registering the software, and once you&#39;ve decided to buy, tools like scan scheduling and driver backup and restore are immediately available. You can download and install every recommended update with a single click, although you won&#39;t be able to uninstall faulty drivers if you happen upon them – it doesn&#39;t have an uninstall tool.","Many lesser-known driver finders will bundle extra programs into their installers. As you&#39;re trying to get them onto your system so you can run a scan and fix your computer&#39;s problems, they&#39;re sneakily installing new toolbars into your browser, changing your home page or even setting your system up for annoying pop-up ads. Though it doesn&#39;t guarantee OEM sources for all its drivers, DriverScanner&#39;s installer is clean and malware-free."]},"id":"06fe43e3-7cf5-473d-afdc-18a3bfaad478","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a2e428a9-47dd-414d-bb95-cf0dbaa8ee11","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The best driver software programs stand out in some way.
