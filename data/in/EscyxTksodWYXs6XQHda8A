This waterproof camera is rated to survive dives down to 65 feet underwater as well as drops from 5.8 feet. These ratings are on the upper end of durability.","Although the camera can endure a lot, it doesn’t feel quite as rugged as others in-hand, such as the <a href=\"/ricoh-wg-50-review\">Ricoh WG-50</a>. However, Fujifilm claims it is quite a rugged device. The battery compartment is sealed by a dial lock mechanism. To unlock the compartment, you have to press the button in the center as you turn the dial. In our tests, we found that cameras with this mechanism were the easiest to use.","We tested each camera underwater by capturing photos of our test scene inside a large fish tank. The underwater photos that the XP130 produced were a little above average. The waterproof camera rendered the water a soft blue, making the overall picture look bright. The XP130’s dry-land images were average as well, if not slightly below the quality of the underwater images it captured. The color saturation in the test scene was good, but the blues rendered slightly more purple. The problem that mostly docked the dry-land testing was the image sharpness, especially when you zoomed in. The camera offers 2x digital zoom and 5x optical zoom. There is some noticeable grain, but it’s not nearly as bad as many of the lower-ranked cameras we tested.","The camera’s menu is easy to navigate. When you press the menu button on the back of the camera, a simple and clearly labeled menu pops up on the 2.7-inch display. It is a single list with straightforward terminology. There aren’t multiple menus where certain camera parameters are hidden. Within a few minutes of navigating the camera’s menus, we were able to find every option and setting available, which seasoned and amateur photographers alike will appreciate.","The FinePix XP130 has a 16.4-megapixel 1/2.3-inch CMOS sensor. Its ISO ranges from 100 to 6400, when on auto, and its shutter speeds range from 1/2000 to 1/4 of a second. Additionally, a single battery charge can power the device for 240 photos if you keep the power saver on and use auto mode. This is about average for these types of cameras."]},"id":"6e2265ae-8fd7-4ab5-b66a-8ff24e65f8ed","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70133","url":"/fujifilm-finepix-xp130-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-08-08T15:30:23Z","datePublished":"2018-08-08T15:30:23Z","name":"Fujifilm FinePix XP130","synopsis":"The Fujifilm FinePix XP130 is a solid underwater camera that takes respectable pictures and is rugged enough to endure an adventure.
