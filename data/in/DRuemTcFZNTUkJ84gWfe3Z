The spray nozzle is actually a dual-direction mist outlet that lets you point the mist in two different directions. This design element makes it possible to moisturize the air for two sick children or if you want to send mist into two different rooms.","The Stadler Form HERA works so efficiently because it is a high-quality ultrasonic humidifier that converts water into mist by vibrating a disc and then pushes the resulting moisture out into the room. In this process, all the water’s components are converted into water vapor. If you have hard water, sometimes these humidifiers produce a fine white powder or dust that settles on your furniture.","To prevent that from happening, Stadler includes a demineralization cartridge to help remove any calcium and magnesium from your hard tap water. If you use filtered drinking water or distilled water, you will get even cleaner results and will not have to change your demineralization filter as often.","This air humidifier has a patented ionic silver cube designed to inhibit the growth of mold and bacteria in your water tank, ensuring that you are only dispersing germ-free mist. This is particularly important if someone in your home is sick or suffers from allergies.

Warm mist involves heating water and could be a scalding hazard if the machine tips over.

The unit also has an automatic sleep mode that dims the light on the LCD screen so you can sleep without bright lights keeping slumber at bay.","You will also find an automatic shut-off feature that turns the machine off when it is out of water or if the air has reached your specified humidity level. One drawback is that this otherwise first-rate humidifier lacks a timer.","Hard water can affect the performance and life of your humidifier. Not only can it leave a layer of white dust around your house, but over time, mineral buildup can clog your humidifier.
