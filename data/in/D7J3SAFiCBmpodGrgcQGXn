You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","It’s difficult to make a <a href=\"/best-bluetooth-headsets\">Bluetooth headset</a> that looks sleek and inconspicuous, but BlueAnt managed to pull it off with its Q3i headset. The device’s curved design is contoured to fit the face. Like other headsets, this one is made of plastic, and it weighs just 0.35 ounces. Although we liked its look, we weren’t too thrilled with the headset’s build quality and managed to break it in two different ways.","BlueAnt includes additional gel earbuds to help you find the perfect fit. The earbuds both have a concha fin, an extension that fits into the hollow part of your ear to create a more secure fit. When switching the larger earbuds for the smaller ones, we realized they aren’t as easy to slide on as with other headsets. We had to turn the gel tip inside out to get it over the earpiece. Upon doing so, the tip slid off. It took several tries to get it on, and we actually ripped the gel tip completely. It would be nice if BlueAnt included more tip sizes, not only to ensure a proper fit, but also in case you rip one like we did.","When we first charged the BlueAnt Q3i we mistakenly thought the charging port was near the microphone since there was a gap and what looked like a dust cover to protect a micro-USB charging port. Little did we know, it is actually a windscreen to help block background noises. We tugged on and pulled the windscreen off, only to discover it doesn’t cover a charging port. Now, the exposed, sharp windscreen dangles down and scratches the face of anyone who wears it. We admit this was a mistake on our part but still think it was worth mentioning. The charging port is actually located near the earpiece. On a positive note, the headset’s buttons are large and easy to find, and since the power button is on the back underside of its body, you won’t accidentally press it.","During our tests, we found that the headset has poor sound quality and a battery life of just 6.5 hours. BlueAnt advertise an eight-hour battery life, but we never achieved those results in our tests. The headset would also benefit from having a little bit of a tighter seal. It fell out when we shook our heads, and when we ran up a flight of stairs, the headset required adjusting.","From an ease of use standpoint, the headset is strong. The voice assistant tells you if the headset is connected and the battery status, and you can tell it to activate Siri or redial the last number you called."]},"id":"131c1149-7157-411a-b2d2-763ed0e31d01","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"464eda8a-d05b-4283-9148-adc359cd5de9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BlueAnt Q3i headset has a nice design, but we did have our share of hiccups when using it.
