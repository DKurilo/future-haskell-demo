LXT600VP3 is a simple <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-walkie-talkies\">walkie talkie</a> radio with a portable size and a durable design. Its ability to tune in to NOAA weather frequencies allows you to know your local weather conditions.","In our range tests, the LXT performed close to the same on both the high-power GMRS frequency and on the low-power FRS frequency, but it fell far short of the best walkie talkies we tested. While our testers were impressed with the clarity of transmissions up to 1 mile, the accuracy on the GMRS channel significantly decreased beyond the 1-mile mark, dropping the score around 30 percent – meaning only about a third of our transmission from one Midland LXT was discernable by the other at that distance. On the FRS channel the unit failed to transmit anything at distances over a mile.","The Midland LXT walkie talkie set comes with rechargeable battery packs, a charging dock and two radios. The display is backlit and shows you all the relevant information you need, like battery levels and notifications. If you run out of power before you can connect to a charger, you can use three AAA batteries. Unlike some of the other walkie talkie units we tested, the LXT600VP3 doesn’t have any ports for external charging. This means that you have to rely on the included charging cradle or pack along extra AAA batteries if you want to charge on-the-go.","The LXT two-way radio is packed with many of the features that we look for, including keypad tones and locks, as well as channel scanning. The walkie talkie has privacy codes and noise cancelling, so you&#39;ll be able to keep your communications within your group.","The walkie talkie can scan and access local NOAA Weather Alert Radio frequencies, which allows you to get local weather conditions and forecasts. It also has emergency weather alerts, so if there is a wild fire or other disaster in your area, you can get away before you&#39;re trapped. Unfortunately, the Midland LXT does not have an SOS broadcasting feature or a flashlight of any kind. This lack of SOS features makes the LXT the most barebones walkie talkie we reviewed.","The LXT is the smallest unit in our walkie talkie reviews, and each handset weighs just 4.8 ounces. During testing, the LXT fit great in our reviewers’ hands, but we rated it low on our grip scale because it lacked any rubber to prevent slipping.","The clip on the back of the LXT is an alligator-style clip that can open wide and easily clip to a belt, jacket or pocket.","One potential concern with the LXT is the fact that these walkie talkies aren’t rated for any water resistance on the IPX scale. That doesn’t mean that they couldn’t dry out after a rainstorm and still work, but our top-rated walkie talkies are water resistant or, better yet, completely waterproof and submersible.","Midland offers a three-year warranty with the LXT, which is two years longer than other manufacturers. If you have any problems, you can look for support on the Midland website, which offers downloadable user manuals and FAQs. Support agents are available by phone and email. We found the customer support agents to be helpful and knowledgeable.","The Midland LXT600VP3 is a good camping walkie talkie with a reliable range of a mile, but beyond that you won’t get much reception. There are a total of 36 FRS and GMRS frequencies available for obtaining the clearest signal in your area. The weather alerts ensure that you won&#39;t be stuck in a local disaster area, and the optional AAA battery replacement allows you to keep the radio on, even if the rechargeable batteries die."]},"id":"ef82fa4a-a933-42a8-b71d-b9d36ad46430","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"29081e82-493e-4949-88bc-7d69061799a3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Midland LXT600VP3 is a good camping walkie talkie with average range and weather alerts.
