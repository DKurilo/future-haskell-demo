The only visible distinction on the face of the TV is the LG logo placed prominently below the screen. The edges of the screen are straight on all sides except the bottom which has a slight curve to it. The gloss black chassis is so glossy that it is almost mirror-like. Beware if you put this in a room with a lot of ambient lighting because it will wash out the scren. The screen is also supported by a pedestal that matches both color and style to the screen.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"64df1146-b169-4591-bb25-ab42652cd30a","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Users were overall quite pleased with the LG 55LH90 but did notice some fading and blending of colors on some movies.
