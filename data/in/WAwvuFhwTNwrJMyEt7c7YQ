You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","HomeBridge offers <a href=\"/best-mortgage-and-refinance-lenders\">mortgages and home refinancing</a> loans across the nation. It has local agents who are knowledgeable and trained in the latest mortgage regulations. It can work with people who have a lower credit score, and it offers both fixed- and adjustable-rate loans for 15- or 30-year terms. It offers home refinancing, including consolidating a first and second mortgage into a single low-rate loan.","This mortgage company can&#39;t provide construction loans, although it can broker one for you with a different bank. However, it does provide rehab mortgages, which allows you to purchase a fixer-upper that includes money for refurbishing the house.","We were unable to evaluate HomeBridge on its rates because it does not post fees online and is reluctant to give quotes over the phone without getting more specifics than we could provide. During our research, we found that <a href=\"/network-capital-review\">Network Capital</a> and <a href=\"/citimortgage-review\">CitiMortgage</a> offer the best rates.","Most companies give an estimate with the caveat that the numbers may change in the actual prequalification process. However, we did learn that Prospect charges fees at closing that are much higher than the industry average.","HomeBridge can provide loans in any state and Washington DC. There&#39;s no national phone number to contact when looking for a loan, but the website has a locator function. We put in multiple zip codes and found several agents that could service each one. We called local agencies across the nation and had to leave messages in most cases. When we did connect with someone, we found the agents helpful and knowledgeable about the loans and laws in their area. In fact, at one point, a receptionist told us that agents were attending a conference about  upcoming Federal Housing Administration changes. This is one of two mortgage companies that mentioned the changes to us.","The website has a link to its real estate partner as well as to guides, which are short articles with general information on key topics. You can also find a checklist of what you need for the application process and mortgage calculators. Of course, interest rates change daily, so the calculators can only give approximates."]},"id":"92cf8baa-1ba9-4b66-bea4-cab1cb161247","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e9878b7a-5298-4509-8675-c04dec9fae56","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["HomeBridge has agents across the nation and can provide mortgages and refinancing in all 50 states and Washington DC.
