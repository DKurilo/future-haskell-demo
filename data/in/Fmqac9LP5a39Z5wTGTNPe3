Some microwaves feature ventilation systems and you can buy overhead hoods to keep the air in your kitchen fresh, but you don&#39;t want to mess with your Feng Shui by adding anything clunky over the cooktop. That&#39;s where the GE Profile PP989DNBB&#39;s downdraft system comes into play. The fan has low, medium and high settings. This streamlined downdraft cooktop can catch most of your steam, smoke and food odors.","Whether you&#39;re simmering or searing, the metal ribbon heating under the ceramic glass delivers even heat for delicate and hardy foods. The expandable Power Boil located on the front right serves as 6-inch and 9inch burners for medium and large cookware. Pasta and soups boil faster backed by a formidable 3,000 watts of energy on one burner. The other burners, measuring 6 inches on the back right and 7 inches on the left, fit small and medium sized cookware snuggly. You can use your oblong pans and griddles with the bridge elements that combine the two left elements into one large hot spot."]},"id":"8a63651f-9677-43db-9ce1-77d344e6f59d","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/7J2EB4HjYvvrXFnq7r5RMC.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"When handling any amount of heat or food, safety and care is key. This GE Profile model features a control lock to avoid accidental temperature changes or activation. Additionally, the indicator lights illuminate when any of the burners activate, even at low levels. You must use flat-bottomed stainless steel cookware and clean this cooktop with ceramic glass cleaner to prevent scratches and metalmarks. Though the glass is tough against heat, it is not scratch resistant and may stain easily if you use the wrong equipment. Detailed information about cleaning and care for this cooktop is available in the manual and installation guide.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57650-ge-profile-pp989dnbb2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7J2EB4HjYvvrXFnq7r5RMC.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"7J2EB4HjYvvrXFnq7r5RMC","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7J2EB4HjYvvrXFnq7r5RMC.jpg","alt":""},"id":"563a095e-c7bf-4eb8-b0aa-be5c77c743a9","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You can install this GE Profile electric cooktop on your own, but it&#39;s not encouraged.

Some online retailers offer an extended warranty up to five years for the glass surface. If you do install this cooktop yourself, be sure to allow at least 6 inches on either side of the cooktop.
