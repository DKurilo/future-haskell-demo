You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.","The Kobo Aura is yet another eBook reader that is largely unknown to the book-loving masses. That could all change  soon though, as the Aura proves to be an impressive piece of hardware that handily contends with the major players in the eReader sphere. The device isn’t without a few glaring limitations, but overall, it is worth a serious look, particularly if you haven&#39;t yet bought a dedicated eReader.","The first thing you’re likely to notice about the Aura is its smooth display; the screen is completely flush with the surrounding bezel. On the backside, the device is coated in a gripable rubber-like material that enables a firm but comfortable hold. Aside from logos, not much physically distinguishes eBook readers these days, but the Aura is notably elegant and sleek.","If the aesthetics don’t impress you, the readability of this device certainly will. The integrated edge lighting of the Kobo Aura is among the best we’ve seen and permits easy reading in any environment. Additionally, its resolution of 212 pixels per inch is higher than most of the other digital readers in our lineup. This means the text appears crisp and dark, without the soft edges or slight blurring you may see on a lower-resolution eBook reader.","Another standout feature of the Aura is its portability. When you compare eBook readers, this one is definitely among the lighter and smaller reading devices on the market. It also boasts much more local storage than eReaders of comparable size: a whopping 4GB that can hold approximately 3,000 titles. If you are a heavy reader who wishes to carry your entire library with you, the Aura has expandable memory. It’s hard to imagine needing more space than what is already included, but the option to expand is definitely nice.","The Kobo Aura is an impressive eBook reader, but the device has a few limitations that are hard to ignore.  In our testing, touch responsiveness was slightly inconsistent. Every once in a while, page turns seemed sluggish, and it took a few seconds for page swipes to register.","There’s also the issue of the Kobo eBook store. Of all the eBook systems, Kobo is  the weakest. Its selection isn’t as vast, and we found some titles to be more expensive than competitors. Oddly, the eReader doesn’t support periodicals. The Kobo Aura also costs quite a bit more than other leading digital readers, so for the price, we’d expect access to more reading material, including newspaper and magazine subscriptions."]},"id":"e21d36bc-c13f-402c-adaf-c1678ae80514","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c03291a8-d633-4a39-b58d-dc0a052ffb00","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With its current price tag, the Kobo Aura falls somewhere in the middle of luxury and mainstream eBook readers. Whether it’s the right reading device for you  largely depends on your eReader priorities. It’s easy enough to overlook the somewhat inconsistent touch responsiveness, but magazine devotees aren’t likely to be so forgiving for its lack of periodical support. Regardless, unrivaled book capacity among its class makes the Kobo Aura a powerful portable library."]},"id":"274474d5-56b3-4854-a7b9-61197ef73015","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57815","url":"/kobo-aura-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-18T13:21:18Z","datePublished":"2013-10-18T13:21:18Z","name":"Kobo Aura","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":91,"verdict":"Despite a few minor drawbacks, the Kobo Aura is an interesting eBook reader for people with large personal libraries.","pros":["The Kobo Aura can store around 2,000 eBooks."],"cons":["The touch controls are sporadic and sluggish."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-10-18T13:21:18Z","id":"J9tbmG6ecoeovZNhf5Y8Ue","meta":{"title":"Kobo Aura Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Kobo Aura is a dedicated eReader that compares to the Kindle and Nook, but is it as good as the best eBook readers?
