The desktop scanner has many of the same specifications as comparable business models. With a base scan rate of 30 pages per minute at 300 dpi resolution and an automatic <a href=\"/best-document-scanners\">document feeder</a> that can hold 50 pages, its performance specs fall in line with higher-end models.","The machine can scan documents of various sizes, such as ID cards, which makes it a good fit for a doctor’s office or other business that regularly scans patient or customer documents. As with most business desktop scanners, the DocuMate 4440 has standard support for duplex scanning, and its software includes optical text recognition, which allows you to extract text from scanned documents.","As steady as its scanning performance is, the Xerox’s connectivity options leave much to be desired. The scanner only exports scans to email and cloud storage services like Google Drive and Evernote. It’s missing options common to other document scanners, including the ability to export to mobile devices and USB or SD cards. In addition, the scanner doesn’t have Ethernet or Wi-Fi connectivity, so you have to be close to the computer the machine connects to in order to scan unlike with the <a href=\"/brother-imagecenter-review\">Brother ImageCenter</a> and <a href=\"/neatconnect-review\">NeatConnect</a>. While this setup may work if only one person or a small department uses the machine, it can quickly become inconvenient for large offices. Considering that the DocuMate 4440 has an enterprise price tag, its lack of versatile connectivity options brings down its value.","By default, Xerox includes a one-year warranty for the DocuMate. In addition, there is a standard suite of help and support options on the company’s website. While Xerox doesn’t have a live chat support option, you can contact representatives directly by email and phone, and there is a dedicated online support section that hosts documentation and manuals."]},"id":"ce96163e-d601-404e-8033-7fde9291a197","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"03cc2739-6778-40f4-ada2-cd313ec172c4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Xerox DocuMate 4440 has a basic set of features.
