This software works differently than many other photo editing programs. Instead of giving you a toolbar with tool icons, each tool is divided by category tabs. For example, if you&#39;re looking for the cloning tool, you&#39;ll find it under Skin Tools in the &#34;Edit&#34; section. This is easier for beginners to use but might throw off experienced photo editors who are familiar with the standard toolbar setup. If you&#39;d prefer a more traditional setup, you might be interested in <a href=\"/acorn-review\">Acorn</a>. We tested the background removal and content-aware fill tools and found that they worked beautifully in removing unwanted elements from our images.","You can stitch images together using this program to create panoramas, and if the stitching creates any distortions you can adjust them using the lens distortion correction tool. This program also makes it super easy to create HDR images. When you select the HDR option, a window opens and asks you to add two or more images. You&#39;ll also have plenty of control over the settings while using this feature.","If you&#39;re editing a lot of portraits you&#39;ll especially appreciate the &#34;People Beautifier&#34; section, which gives you access to blemish removers, wrinkle removers, a teeth whitening tool and a shine remover. There&#39;s also a body shaping tool. Like the name suggests, it&#39;s intended to help you manipulate images in such a way that your figures look more lean and shapely, should you want to use it.","We counted 47 presets in the program, but CyberLink also offers additional free presets on its website. So, you&#39;ll have plenty of preset options at your fingertips. This software works in layers, which means you can create layer masks and add adjustment layers to your images. This makes it so that your original image isn&#39;t damaged or changed in the process, so you can keep it safe. This software makes it easy to create and add watermarks to your images, which is an good idea if you plan on sharing them online."]},"id":"a4962b12-15be-4863-bcbd-f34871af39f7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Organizing"},"id":"52bad007-43ce-42fc-9036-a4e67c3aad72","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["PhotoDirector Ultra has some of the best organizing tools we&#39;ve seen.
