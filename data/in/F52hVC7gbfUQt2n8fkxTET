You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","When you shop for an <a href=\"/best-extended-car-warranty-services\">extended car warranty</a>, you look for affordable coverage with great service to match the price. Pinnacle Automotive Protection offers a wide range of extended warranties from four different providers, giving you a range of choices regarding what you would like to cover. This can be advantageous for drivers who are looking for the best deal possible and want to control how much they pay for coverage.","We are pleased to see that Pinnacle Automotive Protection offers 22 warranty plans that range from minimal powertrain coverage to comprehensive bumper-to-bumper coverage that covers your engine, AC, suspension and transmission. While actual service contracts are not available for viewing on the Pinnacle website, there are sample contracts that show examples of what you will be agreeing to. Always request a contract in writing before you agree to anything to protect yourself from fraud. Pinnacle has no objections to providing specific contracts if you request them.","Make sure that you carefully read the exclusion lists that are included with each service contract. It is important to make sure you understand exactly what is covered and what is not covered by your extended auto warranty. Knowing these details will help you plan accordingly and avoid surprises when a repair comes up. For example, parts such as wiper blades, oil changes and fluids are not covered because they are considered normal maintenance items. On the other hand, by purchasing an extended car warranty, you also agree to maintain your car to ensure that neglect will not be the cause of a part failure.","Most car warranty service contracts come with emergency 24/7 roadside assistance, which includes towing, fuel delivery, lockout service and more. With Pinnacle, it is easy to get your car fixed because you can take your vehicle to any licensed repair facility, whether it is your favorite local garage or dealer, no matter where you are. Depending on the plan you choose, you can decide to have a $0, $50 or $100 deductible to be paid at the time of service. After the deductable, all repairs are paid directly to the repair shop with a Pinnacle corporate credit card, so you will never have to worry about submitting a reimbursement form to the company.","While Pinnacle&#39;s extended auto warranty plans are not managed in house, but the company takes great care in making sure that you get the auto warranty that is best for your situation. Unfortunately, you cannot get an instant quote online because you are required to submit a form with your vehicle and personal contact information. While it is nice that Pinnacle wants to form a personal relationship with you and guide you through the process of purchasing the right extended car warranty, it would be nice if there were an option to input your car&#39;s mileage, make and model, and your state of residence to get a comparison price list online so you can shop in the middle of the night, on the go or on vacation."]},"id":"1fcafdae-e629-4f94-a541-559f64881ef0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"628e1238-0a4b-4f5d-9791-98d1a416a434","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We are impressed with the number of extended car warranties available through Pinnacle Automotive Protection and the company&#39;s commitment to making sure you get the right warranty for your vehicle.
