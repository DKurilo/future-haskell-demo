We design our tests to match consumer expectations and not those of product designers.","When, as in the case with patio heaters, we can&#39;t test the product in person, we use the same attention to detail to verify our research and interview industry professionals so our informational guides echo the mission of Top Ten Reviews.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","We&#39;ve studied and evaluated patio heaters since 2014. We researched 10 major patio heater brands and assessed the specifications of multiple models from each brand. Due to installation requirements, we don&#39;t test patio heaters in-house at Top Ten Reviews. Instead, we provide helpful information about each brand to help you know what&#39;s available. We also provide advice on the many types of patio heaters and the fuel sources they use. The conclusions we reached come from years of experience, evaluations and product testing in other categories we review.","The online publication Trendir, which chronicles developments in modern home design and decorating, has hailed the move toward more diverse, imaginative and aesthetically appealing patio heaters.","“When the first mushroom-topped residential outdoor space heaters arrived on the market – we were all so happy that we could heat up our patio and sit outside later into the season. It was a way to stay warm without putting a bonfire together. No one worried about the design. That’s certainly changed and for the better! Disguised as lamps, disguised as tables – what will they think of next? There’s an outdoor space heater for every patio and yard, no matter what style you call your own,&#34; according to Trendir.","We also cannot overlook the practical side of having a heater in your outdoor space. Jamie Blundell of Utah certainly knows the value of patio heaters. She remembers great times when her children were young, and the family would make use of her parents’ pool and spacious backyard.","“The kids would swim every day. We’d just start the heaters up, particularly in spring and fall. My parents would open the pool around May 1st and keep it open into mid-October,” Blundell recalls. “Those things would heat for a pretty good distance. We’d sit out there with our guitars and sing – it was nice.”","Blundell&#39;s parents installed a swimming pool in 1980 along with fire pits, and added propane patio heaters in 1993. This made the area nicely warm for at least half the year. Everyone could enjoy barbecues, parties and just getting together, even after the sun went down and temperatures cooled markedly outside their comfy area.<br/><strong><br/>How Much Does a Patio Heater Cost?</strong>","The initial purchase price for a patio heater can vary dramatically from one type to another since there are so many different styles. An attractive patio heater that stands 87-inches tall with a small table where you can set drinks can cost about $135.00, while a ceiling mounted gas heater can run closer to $2,400. The wide price range depends on several factors, including the type of heater you choose, its power, the size of the area it can heat, the materials and design aesthetics. In addition, the operational costs will vary depending on what your local electrical or gas company charges, as well as how often you use your patio heater.","<strong>Are Patio Heaters Safe to Use Indoors?</strong>","The short answer? No. Never. Please, please don&#39;t.","Patio heaters are designed to be used outside, especially the propane and natural gas models. According to <a href=\"https://www.air-n-water.com/propane-heater-safety.htm\">Air-n-Water.com</a>, burning propane creates a byproduct: carbon monoxide. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a tasteless, odorless gas that can replace oxygen in human blood. This leads to carbon monoxide poisoning. When you use a propane-powered patio heater outdoors, there is enough ventilation for the carbon monoxide exhaust to dissipate, but if you use it indoors, you run a high risk of introducing unsafe amounts of CO into your home. Again, don&#39;t use a patio heater indoors.","One way you can monitor your home for carbon monoxide is to install CO detectors. We&#39;ve tested the latest smart smoke detectors, and our top choice, the Nest Protect, has built-in carbon monoxide detectors to help keep your family safe. You can read our full in-depth review here: <a href=\"/nest-protect-review\">Nest Protect review</a>","<strong>Types of Patio Heaters</strong>","Standing Heaters<br/>Freestanding patio heaters are the biggest and most powerful models you can buy. These heaters are usually between 7 and 8 feet tall and come in two general styles: tapered and pyramid. Tapered patio heaters have a heavy base, a long shaft with the heating element on top and a small metal umbrella cover. Pyramid heaters are triangular and use an actual flame covered by a cylindrical tube to generate heat. The best freestanding patio heaters have a warming radius of up to 9 feet, though wind and other outdoor conditions affect this.","Although standing patio heaters are perhaps the most effective at warming large spaces, they have limitations. They’re the heaviest of all the outdoor heaters you can buy, making them difficult to move. If the model you buy one with attached wheels, you’ll need more than one person to move it. They’re also the hardest to assemble. Expect to spend at least an hour on assembly when you take it out of the box. Since it will most likely stay outside all year long, you’ll want to invest in a cover to protect it from the elements when it’s not in use.","Mounted Heaters<br/>Mounted patio heaters are great for heating the area nearest your home. Since they must be attached to a wall or ceiling, they’re less portable than other patio heaters, but they can effectively warm their surroundings. Mounted heaters also save space, and you don’t have to rearrange your patio furniture around a large fixture to keep warm. They’re also easy to power, since you can wire them directly into your home’s wiring. The best mounted patio heaters come with remote controls.","You should be cautious about installing a mounted patio heater yourself. Depending on where you live, there may be restrictions on where and who can install these devices. Furthermore, a certain level of expertise is needed to install them safely and correctly. If you’re not skilled in measuring, drilling, wiring and other electrical work, consider hiring a professional to make sure it’s all done right.","Tabletop Heaters<br/>Tabletop patio heaters are the most convenient way to heat small spaces. These outdoor heaters are miniature versions of the freestanding models mentioned above. They’re lightweight and portable, and you can place them on a table or another surface. This makes them ideal for meals and small get-togethers when you don’t need to heat a large area. You can also take tabletop heaters on the road to campouts and picnics.","Hanging Heaters<br/>Hanging outdoor heaters need to be suspended from a roof, so are limited to using them in places like covered patios, gazebos and other covered spaces. They’re also useful as <a href=\"/best-space-heaters\">space heaters</a> in enclosed areas like garages and toolsheds. Once you set them up, they are great at distributing heat evenly throughout the surrounding area. Since they sit off the ground, they don’t take up valuable space like freestanding and tabletop heaters.","Fire Pit Heaters<br/>Fire pit heaters look like and perform the same function as conventional fire pits, but you don’t need to gather and burn wood. They also all but eliminate the smoke put off by regular fire pits. Fire pit heaters can warm a central area nicely and enhance your patio decor. Still, you should keep in mind that they are generally more expensive, much harder to move and require more maintenance than their smaller, more portable counterparts.<strong><br/></strong>","<strong>Safety Tips</strong>","Using any heating device, especially one with an open flame, can be dangerous. &#34;You want to make sure you can regulate the heat. That&#39;s an important part too. You don&#39;t want to overheat the room. Every day is a fire prevention day,&#34; said Chief Michael Whitzel, with the Franklintown and Community Fire Company in York County, Pennsylvania to <a href=\"https://www.abc27.com/news/fire-chief-gives-safety-tips-after-propane-heater-causes-fatal-perry-county-fire_20180327041359606/1081512177\">WHTM news</a>.","&#34;Make sure it has an automatic shut off on it, so if it does get tipped over, it shuts off for you,&#34; Whitzel said. &#34;Make sure you&#39;re plugging them into an outlet and not an extension cord if it&#39;s electric.&#34;","Space heaters should be turned off and unplugged when you leave the room. For patio heaters, turning off the propane tank valve and making sure it is secured from tipping is a key safety point. Additionally, making sure you keep combustibles three feet or more away from the heater reduces the chances of fires significantly. Firefighter Robert Pomeroy, also with the Franklintown and Community Fire Company recommends following the heater&#39;s manufacturer guidelines, as well as keeping an eye on small children to keep them from burning themselves or knocking over the heater.","<strong>Fuel Types</strong>","Propane Heaters<br/>This type of outdoor heater connects to a propane tank to power the warming element. You can buy propane tanks at many local stores, and all you need to do is connect the tank to the heater, turn on the valve and ignite the element. The best outdoor propane heaters provide 10 hours of warming power per 20-pound tank.","Natural Gas Heaters<br/>These patio heaters are a good choice for customers who have access to a natural gas line. They’re easier to use and less expensive than propane heaters because you don’t have to buy and swap out tanks regularly. However, because they must be connected to a natural gas source, you’re limited to where you can place them on your patio or in your yard. The tradeoff is that you don’t have to worry about running out of fuel or changing a tank.","Electric Heaters<br/>Electric outdoor heaters are convenient because they don’t require special fuel. There are no tanks and no special lines – you can simply plug them into the outlets in your home. They’re more portable than propane models because they aren’t weighed down by a tank and more convenient than natural gas heaters since you don’t need a special connection for fuel. However, like most space heaters, they can run up your electricity bill quickly, and you can only place them as far away from an outlet as their cord or an extension cord allows.
