Thanks to its wheels, you can bring the compactor to trash instead of hauling bags of trash to the machine. You can wheel it out to your driveway to clean your car or to the backyard to tidy up after a family party.","You can use this wheeled trash compactor wherever you have access to an electrical outlet. The front casters lock to keep the machine in place, and the rear casters swivel so you can maneuver it. Just like kitchen trash compactors, the Gladiator’s bin glides out on rails. Also, the compactor opens using a toe pedal so your hands stay free to put debris inside. This machine has a durable metal cover that can withstand tough use.","The Gladiator Garage Compactor GACP15XXMG has a 1.4-cubic-foot capacity, which is standard. It has a compaction ratio of 4-to-1, which means it can compact four bags of trash into the size of one. That’s on the lower end for trash compactors but can still considerably cut down on the number of trips you make to the curb. Also, because of its lower compaction ratio, it costs less than top-of-the-line machines, which makes it a good option if you want a second trash compactor for recyclables like aluminum cans. In addition, since the GACP15XXMG is made to stay in the garage, you can use it for perishables that tend to smell after a few days.","You use a single switch to turn the compactor on and off, and it takes about a minute for the ram to complete a compaction cycle. The machine also has an anti-jam feature, but if you hear the ram struggling or something is in the compactor that shouldn’t be, you can simply open the door to stop the cycle and return the ram to its starting position.","The Gladiator Garage Compactor GACP15XXMG doesn’t have many extra features. For example, it doesn’t have a deodorizing system a delayed start option.","This waste compactor looks rugged and would look out of place in a kitchen. The door is graphite, and the machine would look more at home in the garage next to a toolbox.
