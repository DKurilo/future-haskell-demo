It is also known as an almost-ready-to-fly (ARF) kit. ARF <a href=\"/best-remote-control-airplanes\">remote control airplanes</a> come with the plane itself, but you have to add some or all of the essential pieces to the plane. The Multiplex Easy Star II needs a power system and a transmitter (remote control). Multiplex and most other hobby stores have recommendations for the battery, motor and speed control. The assembly is straightforward right out of the box, even for a beginner, but you will have to do some research when putting in the power system. This RC plane is a great option if you are a beginner who wants a bit of a challenge, or if you already fly and want to try a build of your own.  It is best to fly this RC plane outside due to its sheer size. Moving large planes to flying fields can be difficult, but the tailpiece on the Multiplex Easy Star II is removable to make transport easier.","The Multiplex Easy Star II is a durable plane that also offers customization. The elapor foam – Multiplex&#39;s blend – is crash resistant and easy to repair with the recommended glue. The wingspan is 54-inches – the largest of the RC planes we looked at. The full length of the plane is 38-inches and the plane weighs about 24 ounces. The wings mimic those on a glider so you can cut the power and glide while preserving battery power for longer flight times. While building the Multiplex Easy Star II, you can choose to add ailerons for added control. This is recommended only if you have previously flown using three-channel controls and are ready to move up to four-channels. If you do add ailerons, you&#39;ll also need to purchase servos to move them.","The minimum requirement for a transmitter for the Multiplex Easy Star II is a three-channel. A three-channel system is a basic setup. When you add ailerons, you are upgrading to a four-channel transmitter, which is considered a complete system. With the three-channel transmitter of your choice, you can control the throttle, the elevator and the rudder."]},"id":"09d38835-a399-4523-88b6-b3854ae8e324","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d9e8798b-e9db-44b8-8e6e-0da5b1f13f6d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Multiplex Easy Star II is a great beginner RC plane, but only if you are looking for an extra challenge or more customization options.
