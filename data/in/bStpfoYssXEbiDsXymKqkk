Frigidaire FFFH17F2QW is an Energy Star-qualified upright freezer with 16.6 cubic feet of space. That provides plenty of room to store the frozen pizzas, turkeys, desserts, veggies and dinners you can’t fit in the little box over the fridge. This upright freezer offers energy-friendly features such as frost-free operation and exterior temperature controls, so you don&#39;t waste energy adjusting the freezer&#39;s temperature by having to open the freezer door. The <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-freezers/amana-review/\">Amana freezer</a> is another nice option that offers a lot of cold storage space. ","This standing <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-freezers/\">freezer</a> has LED lighting, which is not as warm as incandescent lighting but is safer on the environment, generating less greenhouse gas. This freezer&#39;s walls are thicker than average to keep food frozen for up to two days in the event of a power outage.","While there is no alarm to alert you if the door is left open, this freezer has the advantage of locking. This is a nice feature if you have children whose access to the freezer you want to monitor. It also helps prevent the door being left open. The key on this freezer automatically ejects after the door locks so you won’t leave it in the door.","This Frigidaire upright has an automatic defrost system so you don’t have to empty it out and defrost it yourself. The interior temperature rises when the freezer senses that there is built-up ice to melt. Temperature changes like this increase the potential for freezer burn, but you can guard against it by tightly wrapping your food.","The estimated operating cost of this Frigidaire model is $52 a year. This Frigidaire upright freezer has an unusual design that is taller and wider than most other brands&#39; models, but with below-average depth and shelf space. It still offers plenty of storage space, however.","This Frigidaire upright freezer lacks a fast-freeze feature, which may be a problem if you have food you want to freeze quickly. It also lacks a reversible door, which would allow you to configure the door hinge on the left or right based on where you put the freezer in your home. Frigidaire offers a one-year warranty with its upright freezers, and you can choose to extend the service agreement at an additional cost.","The Frigidaire FFFH17F2QW offers thick walls to lock in the cold in the event of a power outage, as well as frost-free and automatic defrost functions. While this stand-up deep freezer&#39;s interior space is more than adequate to store and organize your frozen food, some additional shelf space would be helpful."]},"id":"52b53ab6-a069-4029-9014-c9634211d6c4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69335","url":"/frigidaire-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-23T18:15:55Z","datePublished":"2017-05-23T18:15:55Z","name":"Frigidaire FFFH17F2QW","synopsis":"The Frigidaire FFFH17F2QW is an Energy Star-qualified upright freezer with 16.6 cubic feet of space.
