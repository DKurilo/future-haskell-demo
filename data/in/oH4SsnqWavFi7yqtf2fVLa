We placed the speaker on a table that was roughly 4 feet from the ground. Still, the Wi-Fi speaker literally rattled the floor as we listened to the bass-pumping group Break Science at high volumes. We felt the bass in our feet. That type of bass production usually only comes from speaker systems that provide a separate subwoofer. The bass was high quality too, not just a bunch of low end that drowns out the rest of the song. This type of bass production makes it a suitable speaker for listeners who prefer electronic dance music and hip-hop.","The JBL produces an overall warm and balanced tonal quality that sounds natural and unforced. For example, we listened to &#34;Bloom&#34; by Radiohead, a song with a highly complex arrangement of drum loops and orchestral instrumentation. Midway through the song when the arrangement begins to get chaotic, with the strong blend of vocal harmonies and orchestral parts, the JBL remained balanced. The vocals never got lost in the mix of chaos, nor did the repetitive pounding drum loops become muddy and lose definition. To accurately reproduce this song is a testament to the balanced sound quality provided by this home wireless speaker.","The balanced and full sound quality continued as we listened to the guitar-heavy sounds of Rage Against The Machine. The speaker features the bass prowess to push the kick drum to provide the punch and attack most Rage songs are known for. The distorted guitars and bass lines never waivered either. Everything stayed tight and focused. The instrumentation didn&#39;t push the speaker beyond its limitations even at high volumes – a feat that most lower-ranked speakers couldn&#39;t achieve while playing Rage. The listening experience we had with the JBL Authentics L8 was very enjoyable regardless of the genre."]},"id":"04de02b8-dd3d-4825-8124-83bc9f2c169a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Performance"},"id":"2f506fa8-b177-4a25-9ff2-f09251398d0b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/dibjpJByMb9bTNQQY7i8xU.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The L8 can connect to every type of commonly used wireless protocol.
