Solar power systems provide convenient energy that is clean and renewable. As long as you have sun, you have power. The lower wattage kits, such as the <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-portable-solar-power-systems\">Poweradd 40W Solar Panel</a> can keep your cell phone or laptop charged, while the larger emergency kits, like the <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-portable-solar-power-systems\">Goal Zero Yeti</a> or <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-portable-solar-power-systems\">Renogy&#39;s Solar Suitcase</a>, will keep the lights on or even power the inside of your recreational vehicle.","<strong>Portable Solar Power Systems: What to Look For</strong>","Remember, portable doesn’t always mean it is small enough to put in your pocket or backpack. In fact, many kits that advertise as portable are heavy briefcases or even blocks that roll on wheels. Choosing the right solar power kit depends on your required wattage, adaptors and accessories you need, and how much you’re looking to carry.","<strong>Wattage</strong><br/>What are you going to be charging and how much power do you need? Prices will vary, and the wattage of the portable solar power system could be as low as 4 watts to as high as 1,500 watts. Don&#39;t buy lower wattage systems just to save money though. The lower the wattage, the longer it takes to charge. If you’re in need of power during an emergency, you can’t put a price on your peace of mind.","<strong>Accessories</strong><br/>When looking at different units, pay close attention to how and where the power is stored. If you buy a solar power system to charge electronic devices, you might also need to purchase separate accessories such as USB plugs or wall-style sockets. Some systems are so basic that the only way to save solar energy is by using alligator clips and an external battery.","<strong>Weight &amp; Compactness</strong><br/>This is the true value of your solar power system, and whether or not it truly is portable. You should pay close attention to the weight, especially if you’re considering a system for a road trip or a long-distance hike. A 15-pound solar panel adds a lot of weight when backpacking. If it’s a larger system for staying off the grid, you won&#39;t mind the weight if you keep the solar power unit in a cabin or RV. Consider how small it is and if it&#39;s easy to store.","A portable solar power system is the grown-up version of building a fort. With the right portable solar power system, you are only limited by your imagination. A fully charged system could allow you to write on your laptop under the stars or keep food fresh without lugging around ice. The right solar power kit allows you to stay plugged in without the leash of the grid."]},"id":"062d6a40-8e70-4a86-b30e-e1744cf136de","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"041dc362-3261-4f0c-9c6f-7718f9628900","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G7NKH7A/?&tag=ttr_portable-solar-power-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1388[art|NA[pid|61676[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">d.light</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009MIPH36/?&tag=ttr_portable-solar-power-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1388[art|NA[pid|61677[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Go Power 80W Solar Kit</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D5RVMAM/?&tag=ttr_portable-solar-power-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1388[art|NA[pid|61678[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Goal Zero Yeti</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EVFEBKU/?&tag=ttr_portable-solar-power-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1388[art|NA[pid|61679[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Instapark Mercury27</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M16KLLE/?&tag=ttr_portable-solar-power-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1388[art|NA[pid|61680[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Poweradd 40W Solar Panel</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HR8YNK6/?&tag=ttr_portable-solar-power-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1388[art|NA[pid|61681[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Renogy Solar Suitcase</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006JO0TC/?&tag=ttr_portable-solar-power-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1388[art|NA[pid|61682[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sunforce Solar Battery Trickle Charger</a>","<a href=\"http://sunreadypower.com/purchase/\">SunReady SunCase Mini Charger</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006R58WU2/?&tag=ttr_portable-solar-power-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1388[art|NA[pid|61684[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Wagan Solar Cube 1500</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K1LBTZS/?&tag=ttr_portable-solar-power-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1388[art|NA[pid|61685[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Zamp Solar 200-Watt Charging Kit</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"d30683c9-db98-416f-9b00-ab142e36683f","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1388","url":"/best-portable-solar-power-systems","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-08T19:32:46Z","datePublished":"2017-03-08T22:35:11Z","name":"Best Portable Solar Power Systems","synopsis":"Portable solar power systems provide clean, renewable energy at home and outdoors.","review":{},"strapline":"Portable solar power systems provide clean, renewable energy at home and outdoors.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-03-08T22:35:11Z","id":"xtMMEapBE3xXwLG7wui6ie","meta":{"title":"The Best Portable Solar Power Systems","description":"Looking for the best portable solar power system?
