Audio Converter is a unique program that has more features than your average audio converter software. In addition to using it to import and convert audio, you can extract audio from video and make some general video edits. For example, you can trim a video’s length and adjust brightness, saturation and contrast. During our testing, we focused mainly on evaluating the program&#39;s audio prowess.","This <a href=\"/best-audio-converter-software\">software converts audio</a> files quickly. In fact, it is one of the fastest programs we tested – it compressed our 625MB WAV file to a 26MB MP3 file in 1 minute and 7.7 seconds. This is just a few seconds shy of the second-fastest audio converter in our buying guide, <a href=\"/audials-review\">Audials Tunebite</a>.","We also found that AnyMP4 is one of the simplest programs to use. We tested each software by counting the number of steps it takes to complete various audio conversion tasks. We determined that it takes just a couple mouse clicks to perform most tasks in this software.","AnyMP4 Audio Converter is compatible with 23 audio file formats and can convert them to 14 different output formats, which is more than many competing audio converters, including iTunes. The software can also extract audio data from videos. We tested each program using five video formats: M4V, MOV, MP4, MPG and WMV. AnyMP4 extracted the data from files in all of these formats smoothly and efficiently.","You can use this software on both PC and Mac computers. If you need assistance with your audio converter, you can visit AnyMP4’s website to browse the FAQs section, or you can contact the company via email for direct support. AnyMP4 answered our email within 24 hours, which is speedy for email support.","AnyMP4 Audio Converter is unique in that it has some video editing tools and you can use it to extract audio from video files. The video editing tools allow you to trim video length and make some minor adjustments to the picture. This audio converter is also compatible with quite a few audio formats and is easy to use."]},"id":"efa69059-06ae-4059-9d41-de645ccb32b9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66218","url":"/any-mp4-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-14T22:14:52Z","datePublished":"2015-07-14T22:14:52Z","name":"AnyMP4","synopsis":"AnyMP4 Audio Converter is a unique program that has more features than your average audio converter software.
