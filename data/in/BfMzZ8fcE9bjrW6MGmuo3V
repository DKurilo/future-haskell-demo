Slice is a modern <a href=\"/best-toasters\">toaster </a>with an old-fashioned look. Its classic design would seem normal in a 1960&#39;s kitchen. Available in eight colors, the SMEG 2 Slice can fit in with any kitchen decor. It comes in cream, red, black, chrome, blue, pink, pastel blue and pastel green. Though retro in appearance, this unit has many features found on contemporary toasters, such as a removable crumb tray and a reheat setting. However, as cool as this colored toaster looks, it did have an issue with toasting.","This toaster runs hot. In our first test we used the middle setting and expected to get golden brown toast. Instead, we pulled out a burned slice of bread. This continued in our consistency test, in which the consecutive slices of toast came increasingly darker as we toasted one after another. It was only after dialing down the toasting power to a little less than two that we got better quality results. In fact, this toaster had the top score in the bagel test. This machine does toast well if you put it on low settings, but anything it the upper range of its settings can tend to produce scorched toast.","The high power of the SMEG 2 Slice comes with another disadvantage – the exterior gets significantly hot. Out of the toasters we tested, this one had the second hottest average external temperature of 127.9 degrees Fahrenheit. This was much higher than the overall average of 98.8 degrees. A safer toaster choice is the <a href=\"/breville-smart-toaster-review\">Breville Smart Toaster</a>. ","This toaster also ranked low on our Ease of Use score, in large part because due to the position of its crumb tray. While many toasters have a front facing crumb tray, the tray of this one is accessed from the back. This is an inconvenient position, particularly if the machine is tucked into a corner, as you’ll have the move the unit in order to reach behind."]},"id":"aba46045-0d0c-4a69-8dc4-6b770712fc31","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8b0483ac-b2ac-41c1-8f87-09f7b3ffa52f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The SMEG 2 Slice is a chic toaster that will stand out on your countertop.
