The platform also provides <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/3d-printing-services,review-2323.html\">3D printing services</a>, so your models can be printed and shipped straight to your door.","Tinkercad’s 3D design tools are accessible to beginners and experienced designers alike. Shapes that you place on a design field are stretched, contorted and combined to make your 3D model. You can group shapes to together to make more detailed designs, or import 2D or 3D vector shapes that can be extruded into 3D models. The 3D printing company also allows you to import external 3D files that become editable shapes in the Tinkercad platform.","If you’re new to 3D design, Tinkercad provides a number of tools and tutorials that enable you to explore and learn about the process. Tinkercad offers step-by-step lessons on the design process to help newcomers get acclimated. It also allows you to browse its library of more than 4 million pre-created designs to get ideas and learn tricks from other designers in the community.","Tinkercad can be used as a 3D design platform, or as a 3D printing service. The app allows you to print your designs using your own 3D printer and material. That gives you control over every stage of the 3D printing and design process, which is unique among 3D printing service providers. Or, if you don’t have a 3D printer, Tinkercad has direct integration with third-party printing services that gives you a range of printing options. That means you can have your design printed and shipped directly to your door with a single click.","Tinkercad is a free web-based app. It runs on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems, and it performs best with Chrome and Firefox browsers. The web-based architecture of Tinkercad enables team members to collaborate on designs from across the country at no cost to you. 3D design files are stored on the cloud, so they’re easy to access from multiple computers.","Tinkercad focuses on 3D design tools rather than 3D printing services; however, it offers both. The 3D printing business’s tutorials and resources allow designers of all skill levels to improve design skills and shepherd products through the process from beginning to end."]},"id":"1e97bd68-ffe8-44d2-879d-97ff83df5de1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66932","url":"/tinkercad-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-16T15:54:28Z","datePublished":"2015-09-16T15:54:28Z","name":"Tinkercad","synopsis":"Tinkercad is an online 3D printing design tool.
