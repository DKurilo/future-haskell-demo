However, if you’re working from a Windows computer – it doesn’t work from a Mac − this smaller, stand-alone scanner comes with all the software you need. The Panasonic KV-S1015C enables you to scan business cards and export the data to Microsoft Outlook or your preferred contact database. The scanner can send your digital files to cloud-based storage or applications like Google Drive and Evernote or to your company’s FTP site. You can program the three buttons on the front for the functions of your choice and thereby enable one-touch scanning.","In our tests of raw scans, the Panasonic KV-S1015C was far faster than its stated 20 pages per minute. Converting the pages to searchable PDFs did add to the time involved, but this is a fast scanner. The automatic document feeder holds up to 50 pages, so if you are scanning large batches, you don’t need to feed it one page at a time as you do a flat-bed scanner. And, if you want to feed in an EKG or a receipt listing hundreds of items, the Panasonic KV-S1015C scans single documents up to 100 inches in length. There is no suggested limit on the number of scans you can put through this machine in a single day, as there is for most of our other reviewed scanners. At five and a half pounds and less than six inches tall, it’s also a compact scanner that fits on any reception desk.","What keeps this model in Panasonic’s lower price bracket is that it is a stand-alone model. You cannot put it on your network. You cannot run it from your mobile devices. And, it needs to be physically hooked up to your computer, because it’s not wireless. It does have a three-year warranty and good support."]},"id":"dacabcf1-203c-43c2-bc21-ced2d2757733","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"97cfc8d8-7ac1-418c-9c3e-05f7f8d554cc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite being a stand-alone Windows machine, the Panasonic KV-S1015C is a compact but powerful document scanner that supports an array of scanning functions and cloud applications.
