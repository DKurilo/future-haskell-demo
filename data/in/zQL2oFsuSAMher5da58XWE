By the scanning of a user&#39;s current contact list and email folders the spam filter software creates a white list of allowed senders. The creation of a blacklist occurs more slowly. Upon the receipt of an unwanted or bulk email, the user adds the sender&#39;s email address, IP address or even domain to the spam blocker&#39;s blacklist.","Emails that come from unknown senders are stored in the spam filter software&#39;s designated quarantine folder. Further, the spam blocker can send an auto-response to the unknown sender that contains a challenge/response message.","The challenge/response message is the main weapon of ChoiceMail One&#39;s spam blocker arsenal. The recipient of the auto-response receives instructions to visit the ChoiceMail One Website. Once there, the recipient of the auto-response must list the reason for the email correspondence as well as provide his or her name. The ChoiceMail One user receives the collected data and decides to allow or block the sender of the communication.","Ultimately, the spam filter software&#39;s overall method considers all incoming email spam until the user designates the message otherwise. The spam blocker comes equipped with a zero tolerance policy for spam and unwanted email messages.","The spam blocker is almost 100 percent effective at blocking and filtering spam and bulk email. However, this permission-based method may contain one serious drawback. Some users may be reluctant to disclose their personal information to a third-party website. The failure to provide ChoiceMail One&#39;s requested information effectively thwarts the sender&#39;s attempt to contact the ChoiceMail One user."]},"id":"9fff7ad4-2d75-4993-b084-546e50479b10","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Blocking &amp; Filtering"},"id":"15c0ecbc-7ffa-4ab5-a777-c1a0435df8c6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The spam filter software is successful at protecting the user from Phishing attacks, viruses, worms, keyloggers and other forms of malware.
