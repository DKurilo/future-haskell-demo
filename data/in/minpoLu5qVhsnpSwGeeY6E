The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-canister-vacuums\"><em>Canister Vacuums</em></a><em> here.</em>","If you are searching for a mid-range canister vacuum suitable for all surfaces, the Electrolux Oxygen EL7062A is one of the best options available. Whether you have carpet, hard floors or even drapes and upholstery, the adjustable suction levels enable it to perform well. Electrolux is a brand not unfamiliar with designing industry-defining vacuums, and this one stands as a flagship product due to its versatility and efficiency.","Whereas most canister vacuum cleaners retain the majority of motor function in the canister portion to allow the head sufficient mobility, the Electrolux Oxygen actually makes use of a power head. This entails a separate motor in the head to drive through carpet cleaning making the task of pushing it even easier. When it comes to switching surfaces from carpet to hard floors, you can even control the brush roll through the use of fingertip controls.","The Electrolux stands out as an ideal small canister vacuum due to its noteworthy filtration system. The vacuum comes with a long-life HEPA H12 filtration system, ensuring the air coming out of your device is even cleaner than the air it sucks in. The filters allow for a 99.97 percent capture rate of dust and allergens, which when combined with the Electrolux S-style bag, provides a double-tiered line of defense against dust particles re-entering the air. The canister itself is designed with filtration in mind.","While users of this high quality device won&#39;t benefit from the guaranteed cost savings of a bagless canister vacuum cleaner, you can rest assured this device won&#39;t release dust back into the air when you empty it. In truth, you can actually reuse bags by simply emptying the bag periodically before the bag change indicator light turns on.","The Electrolux Oxygen EL7062A is designed with the typical user in mind, providing multiple features designed to keep your home and the air in it clean. Whether you&#39;re preparing for hay fever season or simply need a clean home, this top rated canister vacuum will perform its job with flying colors. This low-maintenance device will prove invaluable over the long-term by keeping the numerous surfaces in your home free of dust, dirt, allergens and other unwanted particles."]},"id":"1cebd992-94e7-4b04-a525-ee8fc61bb9af","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57694","url":"/electrolux-oxygen-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-04T13:31:42Z","datePublished":"2013-10-04T13:31:42Z","name":"Electrolux Oxygen EL7062A","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
