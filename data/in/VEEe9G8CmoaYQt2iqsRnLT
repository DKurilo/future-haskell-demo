Although some people use regular tablets to access online books, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eReaders</a> are more conveniently designed for reading and offer free books and other perks that tablets do not. Most recently, waterproof eReaders are taking over the market. Gone are the days of worrying about the conditions in which you read your eBook. Read on to learn what fuels this new trend and about the most popular eBook readers on the market.","<strong>Benefits of Using a Waterproof eBook Reader</strong>","Think about the most common places you like to read   on your couch, in the bathtub, next to the pool, in bed, on the beach. Many of these favorite spots involve water. A primary benefit of a waterproof eBook is that you no longer have to worry about the device getting wet. Have you ever dropped your phone in the toilet, bathtub or pool and had to bury it in a bag of rice to try to save it? You never have to worry about what happens when you do this to your eReader. A waterproof device removes all fear of bringing your eReader with you to the beach or pool or even walking to work in the rain."]},"id":"bbd89cba-ad96-40e3-b577-3e83f6a796f8","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Another major benefit is that spills and accidents won t harm it.

It has a rechargeable battery with a life up to eight weeks, as well as a one-year warranty. Its front light enables reading in the dark. Furthermore, a new version of the Kindle Voyage is expected to be waterproof later in 2015.","<strong>Waterproof Cases</strong>. There are several notable waterproof cases for eBooks on the market. Designed for multiple versions of the Kindle, The Incipio Atlas is a top contender. The Proporta BeachBuoy offers various sizes, and the Overboard Sleeve, which fits 8  to 10  eBooks.
