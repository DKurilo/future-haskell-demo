The other message, located on the underside, contains the most important medical information so the emergency services give you the right help from the start.","There is an array of USB medic alert bracelets to choose from, suitable for men, women and kids. Select the right model based on the storage space and quality of the bracelet. Make sure it has a clear medical alert logo and that it can withstand your daily routine.
