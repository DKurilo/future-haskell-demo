This compact unit can lower temperatures by up to 30 degrees in a small room, and it’s easy to operate. Also, its long, 6-foot power cord makes it easy to position.","The CS10XE’s fan has a maximum airflow of 300 cubic feet per minute (CFM), so it works best in small spaces. According to Honeywell, the unit can cool a room of up to 175 square feet. However, it can also spot cool in larger rooms.","This cooler doesn’t use much power, which is a great benefit. On its lowest setting, it uses only 100 watts of power. As such, it costs about $9 to run over the course of three months – the length of a typical summer. While running the cooler at its highest setting during peak temperatures requires more energy, even at its max, it’s far cheaper to run the CS10XE than a traditional air conditioner.","Its 2.6-gallon water reservoir is a bit larger than those on some similarly priced models, including the <a href=\"/luma-comfort-ec110s-review\">Luma Comfort EC110S</a>, so the Honeywell CS10XE can run longer between refills. However, the full water tank weighs almost 21 pounds, which may be too heavy to carry for some people.","The CS10XE is aesthetically pleasing with its silver and black casing, and it looks good with most home and office decor. The cooler weighs 23 pounds and measures 31.5 x 15.7 x 13.5 inches, so it is relatively compact. In addition, there is a handy grip on the back that makes it easy to carry. As such, it is a good choice if you plan to transport your portable swamp cooler between your home and office.","An oval-shape front grille runs across a series of louvers, which you can adjust to direct the airflow. The cooler also has a large LED display with a control panel you use to turn the unit on and off, set the blower speed, activate the timer, and run vertical oscillation. The digital display is easy to see, even in low light.","The CS10EX also includes a remote control, a carbon dust filter and a low water alarm. The carbon dust filter captures particles and cleans the air as the cooler blows, and the remote control lets you adjust all the same settings you can on the cooler’s display. In addition, you can turn off the CS10EX’s cooler pump and run it as a fan. Honeywell covers this cooler with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"c3936e37-eb96-42fc-bc56-f57b111225d5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66094","url":"/honeywell-cs10xe-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-09T13:32:35Z","datePublished":"2015-07-09T13:32:35Z","name":"Honeywell CS10XE","synopsis":"The Honeywell CS10XE is one of the most affordable indoor portable evaporative coolers on the market.","review":{"rating":84,"verdict":"The Honeywell CS10XE&#8217;s low energy consumption and small size make it an appealing purchase if you need to cool a small space.","pros":["You can position the adjustable louvers to direct cold air where you need it."],"cons":["It can&#8217;t cool large rooms."]},"strapline":"The Honeywell CS10XE is one of the most affordable indoor portable evaporative coolers on the market.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-09T00:00:00Z","id":"GDerByaVqmTfMzyfPoMjV7","meta":{"title":"Honeywell CS10XE Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Honeywell CS10XE&#8217;s low energy consumption and portable size and weight make it an appealing purchase if you need to cool small spaces."},"products":[{"slug":"honeywell-cs10xe","url":"/product/honeywell-cs10xe","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:25:13Z","name":"Honeywell CS10XE","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:25:13Z","id":"SgHVbUbqPKJww3BhwU5GQ9","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:25:13Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/KKhnoUiECKyuhPMEhKViD3.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:25:13Z","mimeType":"","name":"92dd0705ecc41dc68ccc6133311cc11b.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/92dd0705ecc41dc68ccc6133311cc11b.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:25:13Z","id":"KKhnoUiECKyuhPMEhKViD3","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KKhnoUiECKyuhPMEhKViD3.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Honeywell CS10XE Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Honeywell CS10XE&#8217;s low energy consumption and portable size and weight make it an appealing purchase if you need to cool small spaces."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/KKhnoUiECKyuhPMEhKViD3.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:25:13Z","mimeType":"","name":"92dd0705ecc41dc68ccc6133311cc11b.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/92dd0705ecc41dc68ccc6133311cc11b.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:25:13Z","id":"KKhnoUiECKyuhPMEhKViD3","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KKhnoUiECKyuhPMEhKViD3.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Honeywell CS10XE Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Honeywell CS10XE&#8217;s low energy consumption and portable size and weight make it an appealing purchase if you need to cool small spaces."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/hvac/best-portable-evaporative-coolers/honeywell-cs10xe-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:25:13Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:25:13Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"air-conditioning","url":"/home-and-garden/air-conditioning","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:25:13Z","name":"Air Conditioning","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:25:13Z","id":"pVrs4zPdxV4QVcV5FoWtAd","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
