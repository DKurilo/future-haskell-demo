TomTom estimates that if you use the traffic service one hour per day, you’ll use under 10MB of data per month, which is a relatively small amount.

You can speak the voice prompt and then tell it the address you’d like to navigate to, or use several other prompts to access different features. This increases your safety while you drive, as it helps you keep your hands and eyes on the road. Additionally, it is a convenient feature to have, since navigating the device’s interface can be a bit of a hassle at times, as TomTom’s interface isn’t the most intuitive.
