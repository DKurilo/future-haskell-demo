This top-load washer has a washer tub made of porcelain with a capacity of 3.6-cubic feet. That&#39;s a little smaller than some of the other washers on our list, but definitely enough to handle a decent load of laundry. However, porcelain tubs are generally prone to chipping, so you&#39;ll have to be extra careful about what you leave in pockets.","This top-loading washing machine doesn&#39;t have as many wash cycles and other options as the best washing machines, but it still offers 10 wash cycles. These options include specialty cycles, such as one for cleaning the washer and another for bulky laundry loads. You also have the option to select from five water temperature settings. The console on the top of the machine has cycle status lights, which light up according to what stage of cycle your load is in, so you can keep track of your laundry&#39;s progress.","This unit isn&#39;t Energy Star qualified. According to the unit&#39;s Energy Guide, you&#39;ll spend about $52 a year and use approximately 488 kilowatt-hours annually to run this machine. Both numbers are on the higher end compared to other top-loading washing machines. However, the machine will adjust water levels per load according to what options you select, so you&#39;ll save on water usage by only using as much as you need to get your laundry clean.","This top-loader also has a disappointing warranty of one year for the entire machine. If you need to contact the company for help and support, you can find a phone number and email on the main website."]},"id":"d2d8fdfd-cead-4aa2-9ece-9ff8c034c35e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"71212fdb-2a44-48d3-8c38-f6da96b93a6d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenmore 23102 is a budget top-load washing machine.
