According to Gerber Gear, its axes slice through wood at three times the average depth for axes in a similar class.","The testers at Active Junky tried the Sport Axe II, which this hatchet replaces, and found it &#34;somewhere between a monstrous beaver (for cutting enthusiasm) and a motivated woodpecker (for smooth and unencumbered rhythm).&#34; Our reviewers credit this in part to the blade&#39;s coated surface which reduces friction and does not stick when it encounters grit or sap. The 14-inch hand axe has the same coating, as do all Gerber camping hatchets.","The testers also found it easy to give the blade a quick sharpening, even in the field.","The axe itself weighs just under 23 ounces and measures 14 inches long, making it compact, but it&#39;s well balanced for an easy yet powerful swing. The composite handle, made of glass-filled nylon, has a soft-touch overmold that is shock absorbent to reduce vibration, and flares slightly to hold your grip, even in slippery conditions like rain. However, some users have said the handle is still slippery. Our testers suggest wrapping the handle with athletic tape if it becomes an issue for you.","The 2.6-inch blade has an unusual sheath. Made of formed plastic, it covers the cutting edge and one side of the handle, with a locking mechanism to hold it in place. There are no clips for attaching it to your belt.","Gerber offers a lifetime replacement warranty on its products, except where damage comes from misuse, abuse or normal wear and tear. If you are planning on using this camp axe at home or for your cabin and don&#39;t need the sheath, you may find a cheaper version under the parent company&#39;s brand name, Fiskars. They are essentially the same camping axe, just with different color handles."]},"id":"9957c535-c73c-47d3-b12b-77fd63478e1a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68360","url":"/gerber-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-12T18:51:41Z","datePublished":"2016-09-12T18:51:41Z","name":"Gerber 14-Inch","synopsis":"If you're looking for a reasonably inexpensive camping axe that nonetheless can handle a multitude of jobs, the Gerber 14-inch hatchet is both sturdy and provides excellent penetration for cutting wood.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"If you're looking for a reasonably inexpensive camping axe that nonetheless can handle a multitude of jobs, the Gerber 14-inch hatchet is both sturdy and provides excellent penetration for cutting wood.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-12T18:51:41Z","id":"wsN42VykSa5XPJJ9xh9Gj3","meta":{"title":"Gerber 14-Inch Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Gerber 14-inch hatchet is inexpensive but not cheap.
