It came in just shy of our top three because the quality of its charging stand is disappointing. It also gives you one less cleaning mode than the DiamondClean Smart, and its travel case isn’t as fancy.","The toothbrush is priced from just under $200. For the base price, you get the handle, two brush heads, two travel caps, a charger and a travel case. If don’t mind paying a bit more, you can choose a model with a <a href=\"https://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/HX9192_02/sonicare-flexcare-platinum-connected-sonic-electric-toothbrush-with-app\">UV Brush Head Sanitizer</a>. The brush heads that come standard with either model are Philips Sonicare’s AdaptiveClean and InterCare heads. Other Sonicare brush heads are also compatible, so you can get another type if you’d like to experiment with your brushing.","Like each of Sonicare’s <a href=\"/best-electric-toothbrushes\">electric toothbrushes</a>, the FlexCare Platinum Connected uses sonic wave technology to clean your teeth, providing up to 31,000 brush strokes per minute. The <a href=\"/pursonic-review\">Pursonic S520</a> offers 40,000 strokes per minute, and the <a href=\"/health-hp-stx-review\">Wellness HP-STX</a> has up to 38,000. Despite those brushes’ faster vibrations, our testers said their teeth still felt cleaner with Sonicare. The FlexCare has more cleaning modes than the two competitors, and we were impressed with the quality of its brush heads. It’s true that they’re much more expensive than replacement heads for other brands, but they seem much more durable as well. The AdaptiveClean brush head has soft rubber sides, so it’s gentle and massaging on your gums. The InterCare head is designed to remove plaque, and its bristles are long and high-density.","An Oral-B brush we liked nearly as much as the Sonicare FlexCare is the <a href=\"/oral-b-smartseries-review\">Oral-B Pro 5000</a>. That brush uses rotating, oscillating and pulsating motions instead of sonic wave technology to clean your teeth, and it gives you five cleaning modes instead of just three. The FlexCare has three intensity options, however, so it gives you nine settings from which to choose. We also preferred the FlexCare’s grip and sound to the Oral-B’s. Indeed, one of our testers compared the Oral-B Pro 5000’s sound to a power drill.","Speaking of power, the FlexCare’s lithium-ion battery gives you 14 days of use between charges. Like the DiamondClean Smart, the FlexCare is Bluetooth compatible, and you can use its downloadable app to help you set oral hygiene goals and track your progress. To help you brush properly, the app has a TouchUp feature to let you know if you’ve missed a spot. The toothbrush also has a built-in timer, a brushing pressure sensor and a brush head performance monitor to help you create an optimum brushing environment. You can even order replacement heads through the app.","Philips Sonicare backs the FlexCare Platinum Connected with its typical two-year warranty. Customer service is available by phone, email and chat."]},"id":"7ea91e4a-0d14-49cc-a9a8-9ff3b7dbcd9d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66667","url":"/philips-sonicare-flexcare-platinum-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-24T20:00:22Z","datePublished":"2015-08-24T20:00:22Z","name":"Philips Sonicare FlexCare Platinum (Connected)","synopsis":"The Philips Sonicare FlexCare Platinum Connected compares handle to handle with our Best Premium pick, the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Smart.
