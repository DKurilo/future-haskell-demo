Whenever we provide recommendations, we research equipment, interview industry professionals and check in with consumers to create fair and unbiased evaluations of top-rated products. Our goal is to give you real-world information to help you find an exercise bike that meets your personal fitness or rehabilitative needs. During this round of product evaluations, we ramped up our knowledge of the most important features to consider in the selection process. We looked for exercise bikes that are durable, reliable and comfortable, and we kept your budget in mind. After reviewing a long list of possibilities, we selected our 10 favorite products and compared them extensively. We looked at design, functionality, comfort and convenience, and we included several price points. We also considered manufacturers’ warranties and customer support options. We worked hard to make your buying decision easier.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","Once we identified our 10 favorite exercise bikes, we created a detailed comparison table. To provide accurate information, we scoured websites and product guides and reached out to multiple customer service representatives. We also watched product videos and read consumer reviews.","We rated equipment based on five categories: price; fitness features and design; comfort and convenience; console; and warranty and support. While less expensive exercise bikes received higher scores in the price category, we also considered that more expensive products typically have more features and are more durable than lower-end products.","Keeping this in mind, we gave exercise bikes higher marks for adjustable seats, handlebars and consoles. Bikes also scored points based on the number of workout presets and resistance levels they provide and whether they have comfort and convenience features such as cooling fans, speakers, water bottle holders and internet connectivity.","Although we noted each bike’s type, we didn’t recommend one style as being better than the other. Each type has advantages and disadvantages, and the style that works best for you will depend on your needs and personal preferences.","<strong>How to Find the Best Ride</strong>","Finding the right exercise bike can be tricky. As you’re doing your research, it’s important to consider the type of machine you’d like, your budget and the features you want. There are many options available, and it’s a good idea to become familiar with them before you start shopping.  ","“Exercise bikes are great because they are low impact and easy to use at home,” said Nephi Gold, a licensed occupational therapist at <a href=\"https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/orthopedics/intermountain-mckay-dee-orthopedics-and-sports-medicine/\">Intermountain Orthopedics &amp; Sports Medicine</a>, “but there’s a lot of different varieties.”","Whatever type of cycle you choose, Gold suggests you insist on an adjustable seat, adjustable resistance and ease of getting on and off – “especially,” he said, “if you’ve had a total knee replacement or if your balance is bad.”","Along with being good boosts for cardiovascular fitness and overall health, Gold says exercise bikes are excellent warm-up tools for rehabilitating most lower body injuries.","Bike Type<br/>There are three types of exercise bikes – upright, recumbent and spin. Upright bikes have backless seats and look and operate much like commuter bikes. Uprights are generally the smallest, lightest and most affordable exercise bikes available. They are best for people who don’t have mobility or balance problems, and they work the same muscles you’d use riding a traditional bicycle.","Recumbent bikes provide users with a chair for extra back support. The pedals are placed in front of the rider, and you can often adjust how far the seat leans backs. Of the three types of exercise bikes, Gold especially likes recumbents because they benefit people who have had total knee replacements, sprains or fractures. Recumbent bikes are easier to mount than uprights, and their chairs are more comfortable than traditional bike seats. Seniors usually like recumbent bikes best. Recumbents are similarly recommended over upright bikes for obese users and people with neurological conditions.","Spin bikes – also known as indoor cycles – are designed more for serious cyclists than for home fitness enthusiasts. We chose not to include them in this review because they are generally more expensive and less comfortable than recumbent and upright exercise bikes. Also, you must often buy special cycling shoes to use them, and many spin bikes require you to purchase additional equipment if you want to track your workouts. One very popular spin bike is the <a href=\"https://www.onepeloton.com/bike\">Peloton bike</a>. This high-end indoor cycle is marketed as “a private indoor cycling studio in your home,” and it costs nearly $2,000. After the first year, it also requires a $39 monthly membership to access online fitness classes. We didn&#39;t review the Peleton because we focused on more affordable exercise cycles within the $140 to $800 price range. ","How Much Do Exercise Bikes Cost?<br/>The price of home exercise bikes ranges widely from under $50 to nearly $5,000. Based on our research, you should plan to spend around $500 if you want a high-quality, durable machine – but more affordable options suit many households just fine. To give you a good selection, we reviewed bikes with MSRPs ranging between $140 and $800.","The price you’ll pay for your bike depends largely on its features. Less expensive exercise bikes usually have minimal programming options and limited technology. Midrange bikes such as the ones we reviewed are often more solidly built and have more functionality. High-end bikes generally boast the best features and longest warranties.","Common price tiers in the exercise bike market are $300 or less for low-end bikes, $300 to $500 for mid-range products and $500 to $1,000 for high-end home use. Exercise bikes priced above $1,000 are generally designed for commercial use.","Features<br/>Industry experts agree that there are several must-have features to consider before purchasing an exercise bike. Gold named his top three, and there are a handful more.","“Look for an adjustable seat and ease of getting on and off,” Gold said. “It’s also nice to be able to control the resistance, to make it easier or hard.”","Other essential features are a heavy flywheel, large pedals with straps or clips, and a console with multiple workout presets and detailed readouts such as speed, time, heart rate, calories and distance. It’s also beneficial to look for comfort features. Exercise bikes with fans, sound systems, water bottle holders and device racks are more comfortable and convenient to use than bikes with more limited options.","Pedaling the Message Home<br/>The <a href=\"https://staminaproducts.com/\">Stamina Products website</a> says cycling is effective for increasing metabolism and burning calories quickly. It’s also easy on your joints and helps strengthen your hips, glutes, and thighs. The <a href=\"https://www.nautilus.com/home\">Nautilus website</a> says riding an exercise bike also helps strengthen your core muscles, abs and obliques.","If you’d like to enjoy these benefits as part of your personal fitness routine, look for an exercise bike in your price range that provides all the features and functionality you need.","<strong>Air Resistance Exercise Bikes </strong>","Air resistance bikes - or assault bikes as they’re known in the CrossFit universe - offer a more comprehensive cardio workout because you move your upper body in conjunction with the traditional lower body cycling motion. An air resistance exercise bike helps you avoid ligament and joint pain and is a great alternative for a full-body workout like you get with an elliptical trainer. Here are our favorite cost-effective air resistance bikes.","<br/><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Assault-Fitness-Air-Bike-AirBike/dp/B00F74RX40/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Assault Fitness AirBike</a><br/>If you’ve taken a CrossFit class or visited a big-box gym, you’ve most likely seen the Assault AirBike. The durable design uses a sealed cartridge with 20 ball bearings that offer a smooth workout compared to other air resistance bikes. The LCD console is simple and displays your total distance traveled in miles, how many calories you are burning and your total exercise time. There are seven built-in training sessions, or you can customize a workout based on calories, distance, time or heart rate. The six-way adjustable seat makes it easy to position yourself directly over the pedals to avoid awkward or painful movements.   ","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Schwinn-AD6-Airdyne-Exercise-Bike/dp/B008JA2X5S/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Schwinn Airdyne AD6</a><br/>The Schwinn Airdyne is more compact and less expensive than the Assault AirBike. It has an LCD display with similar features to the AirBike, including distance, time, RPM and calorie tracking. The self-balancing pedals have foot straps to keep your feet securely attached during intense workouts, and this air resistance bike has footpegs so you can focus solely on your upper body if you choose. The single-stage belt drive isn’t as smooth as the ball bearing system on the Assault Airbike, but the smaller fan is much quieter. There are transport wheels on the front of the bike that make moving the AD6 around a living room as easy as possible.","<strong>Online Spin Classes </strong>","The best exercise bikes we reviewed have as many as 30 built-in workouts, but if you get bored of those, online spin classes can help you mix it up. These classes require a smartphone or tablet and a Wi-Fi connection, but the variety of workouts and real-time feedback from the instructors help to motivate you and maximize your workouts.","Peloton<br/>You don’t need a Peloton bike to take advantage of the Peloton online classes. The Peloton digital app for <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&amp;hl=en_US\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/peloton-digital/id792750948?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">iOS</a> devices gives you access to more than 4,000 on-demand classes and up to 14 daily live group workouts. You choose from a variety of class styles, instructors and music, and compete in real time with everyone taking the class. Peloton offers a 14-day free trial that includes unlimited access to all of the classes, and memberships cost about $20 per month.","CycleCast<br/>CycleCast doesn’t offer as many on-demand and live classes as Peloton, but a membership is half the price. Classes last between 20 and 60 minutes, and are led by one of six experienced instructors. The app is easy to use and walks you step by step through the process of choosing an instructor, class length and music preference. The app is available for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id999390082\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyclecast.cyclecast\">Android</a> devices and automatically tracks your workouts and syncs with popular fitness apps, like Apple Health and Google Fit. Memberships cost $10 per month or $90 per year.","<strong>Exercise Bike Accessories </strong>","The exercise bikes we reviewed come with a few standard accessories; however, there are upgrade options that improve performance, comfort and ensure the equipment doesn’t harm the flooring beneath it. Here are some recommendations for simple upgrades that are compatible with every exercise bike we evaluated.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IM2JZ1M/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Wellgo WPD-E003 Spin Bike Pedals</a><br/>All the bikes we reviewed include straps to keep your feet securely attached to the pedals. Clipless pedals, like the Wellgo WPD-E003, improve performance and burn more calories because you pull up on the pedal in addition to the normal downward stroke. To take advantage of the clipless function, you need cycling shoes with SPD cleats. These start at around $40. We recommend these pedals for beginners because, like the typical exercise bike pedal, they also have an adjustable strap that allows you to spin with any normal sneaker. The 9/16 inch thread size is compatible with all the indoor bikes we reviewed and most outdoor road bikes.","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CDFCDGI/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Protective Floor Mat</a><br/>The exercise bikes we reviewed are heavy enough to stay in place during intense workouts, but a heavy duty floor mat is a helpful addition to any exercise room. This protective mat keeps the bike from sliding around and also prevents the heavy equipment from damaging the flooring under the bike. The flexible rubber design also reduces noisy vibrations if your exercise room is on an upper floor. The Supermats equipment mat is made without harmful chemicals and is safe for children and pets.","More Exercise Equipment Guides:"]},"id":"776548c7-4a71-469f-a584-05059ae7c714","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-bike-trainers-review\">The Best Bike Trainers</a><a href=\"/best-bike-trainers-review\"><br/></a>","<a href=\"/best-elliptical-machines\">The Best Elliptical Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-home-gyms\">The Best Home Gyms</a> ","<a href=\"/best-treadmills\">The Best Treadmills</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"4f494605-a97f-43b6-9415-4479b1c15756","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"86340d61-a051-4c7f-8035-19cc0536ef50","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/nautilus-u618-review\">Nautilus U618</a>","<a href=\"/schwinn-270-recumbent-review\">Schwinn 270 Recumbent</a>","<a href=\"/marcy-recumbent-me-709-review\">Marcy Recumbent ME-709</a>","<a href=\"/nordictrack-gx-4.4-pro-review\">NordicTrack GX 4.4 Pro</a>","<a href=\"/diamondback-fitness-review\">Diamondback 510UB Upright Bike</a>","<a href=\"/xterra-fitness-fb350-review\">XTERRA Fitness FB350</a>","<a href=\"/proform-review\">ProForm 8.0 EX </a>","<a href=\"/stamina-magnetic-upright-review\">Stamina 5334 Magnetic Upright Exercise Bike</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"5ff50620-ac78-4b7f-9c88-dbcc8881a4f0","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_208","url":"/best-exercise-bikes","authors":[{"email":"jchristensen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-05T19:47:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-05T19:47:00Z","name":"Best Exercise Bikes of 2019","synopsis":"There are three main types of exercise bikes – recumbent, upright and spin – each with its own benefits and limitations.
