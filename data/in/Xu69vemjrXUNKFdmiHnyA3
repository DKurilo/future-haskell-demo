Running two machines just to remain comfortable can really run up your electric bill, but it doesn’t have to be that way. The SoleusAir SG-TTW-12HC can handle both tasks with relative ease.","This wall air conditioner is capable of removing more than 38 pints of moisture from the air every 24 hours, an astounding feat for any wall unit. But the SoleusAir SG-TTW-12HC wall-mounted air conditioner can do so much more. With four fan speeds and 12,000 BTUs of cooling power, you’ll always feel just the right level of chill in the summer months. In addition, come wintertime, the unit’s heat function can help keep you toasty warm, though heat from most wall AC units is meant to be supplemental.","This through-the-wall air conditioner sports a number of other features for added convenience and cost savings. The remote control boasts an easy-to-read LCD display, and the digital thermostat improves temperature accuracy. The energy saving mode and 24-hour timer help ensure that you’re not wasting energy (or your money) by cooling a room more than necessary or when you’re not home. The auto-restart function automatically kicks this wall AC unit back on to previous settings after a power failure. Unfortunately, this unit lacks the handy “filter reminder” function to help you remember to clean the air filter.","SoleusAir provides limited help and support to its customers; a FAQs page with a “helpful videos” section provides basic information and troubleshooting tips on a variety of the company’s products, not just the SG-TTW-12HC wall AC unit. You can find the unit’s manual on its product page, if you lose the one that comes with the unit. The “contact us” page provides a toll-free number, email address and mailing address. You can also order replacement parts via that same number. SoleusAir offers a five-year warranty on the compressor and a one-year warranty on all other parts."]},"id":"4a2566d8-1e8c-4e83-a874-61cd2b4eb8a8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58554","url":"/soleusair-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-01-04T21:51:22Z","datePublished":"2014-01-04T21:51:22Z","name":"SoleusAir SG-TTW-12HC","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
