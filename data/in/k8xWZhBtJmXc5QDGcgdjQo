Google first released them as reference devices, phones the company could point to and say, “This is what Android can be.” Developers use Nexus phones to test their apps, and fans get them so they always have access to the latest versions of Android. But you can only buy a Nexus from Google; they’re not available from carriers, and in terms of popularity, that’s usually enough to count most phones out.","However, a phone this strong can’t be ignored. The Nexus 6P has a speedy processor, a great camera and the best battery life we’ve seen from any modern handheld. With fun and useful extra features and Android Marshmallow to top it all off, it’s no wonder the 6P earns our admiration."]},"id":"b182b51b-b9fa-4912-b6aa-0fe7c16a9b43","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"322aa2ef-83e9-4faf-8014-447b00df1ddc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/hzknwmWG2pmMRe9ca8rXUn.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/reviews/67416/nexus-6p-1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hzknwmWG2pmMRe9ca8rXUn.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"hzknwmWG2pmMRe9ca8rXUn","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hzknwmWG2pmMRe9ca8rXUn.jpg","alt":""},"id":"5ae4b014-46b0-4b54-bed0-711fe29ac0ff","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Given its 5.7-inch, 1440p display, the Nexus 6P is a phablet, about the same size and thickness as Apple’s iPhone 6s Plus. Despite its size, it wasn’t uncomfortable to hold in our testing – a consequence, we suspect, of the ever-so-gentle curvature of its back cover and the perfect placement of its Nexus Imprint scanner. This is a premium phone with a premium build, every bit as impressive as a Samsung or Apple flagship.","In fairness, though, it’s not as unique. Built by the Chinese manufacturer Huawei (pronounced roughly the same as “WAH-way”), the 6P feels like an amalgamation of its competition. The aluminum frame and beveled edges evoke Samsung’s Galaxy Note 5; wide speaker lines above and below the display seem pulled from Motorola’s Moto X. Fortunately, the back cover remains distinctly Huawei: slick aluminum, the Nexus logo and fingerprint scanner, and a camera and sensor bump that’s like nothing else on the market.","That sensor bump is a real oddity. Bold, black and flattened out like a mesa above an aluminum plain, it immediately draws the eye, if not in the best way. The Nexus 6P isn’t an ugly phone by any means, but the black bar is distracting, especially when you first unbox the device. It does make orienting the phone a lot easier, and after extended use, we found we didn’t mind it.","Of course, the real joy of any Nexus device is access to a pure version of the latest Android platform – in this case, Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Marshmallow comes with a bunch of improvements, but our favorite is probably Doze, a battery-saving feature that shuts off all non-essential functions in the phone when it’s put down, then brings them back online as soon as you pick the device up again. With Doze, you can forget to plug in your phone at night, wake up in the morning and find that the battery’s only ticked down a couple percentage points."]},"id":"0302d4cb-f857-4c99-b91d-418540f10937","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"e30f9fb9-1675-4bf4-b38c-94a963e562bd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/pX9YeRWtX2ssFBp4o9Eo2m.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/reviews/67416/nexus-6p-2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pX9YeRWtX2ssFBp4o9Eo2m.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"pX9YeRWtX2ssFBp4o9Eo2m","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pX9YeRWtX2ssFBp4o9Eo2m.jpg","alt":""},"id":"a4ba0da3-01f8-4f04-8557-5bc1190f17d0","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nexus 6P is one of only a few modern phablets that don’t have optical image stabilization.

Google argues that by putting bigger pixels into the 6P’s sensor, the camera can drink in more light in a shorter timeframe. This means the shutter doesn’t have to be open as long, which itself helps to reduce blur.","It’s not a perfect solution. We still managed to take plenty of slightly blurry photos by not being careful as we lined up shots. Taken as a whole, the Nexus 6P easily outshines huge swaths of the competition. With a mild amount of care, its 12.3MP sensor grabs sharp details that are color rich without being overly noisy. You can capture 4K video at 30fps, and at lower resolutions, the phone can manage 240fps video, which translates into stunning slow-motion shots.
