Many of them have a Teflon-like nonstick coating applied to the metal surface, but the Orville Redenbacher&#39;s Stirring Popper 05204 presents a metal heating area with a different texture where you add the oil and corn kernels. This works just fine, and we encountered no problems with anything sticking.","The rotating stirring rod smoothly moves the kernels around the heating plate through the oil, and within minutes, you&#39;ll have plenty of popcorn. If you choose, you can place butter on top of the heating vent area, and as the machine heats up and starts popping the corn, the butter melts and drips onto the popcorn inside.","When you hear no more popping, you can simply replace the cover over the heating vents, which stops any melted butter from oozing out, grasp the heat-resistant handles of the dome and flip it over.
