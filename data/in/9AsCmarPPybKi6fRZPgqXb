This makes VoIP headsets ideal for call centers and <a href=\"/best-small-business-phone-systems\">businesses</a> where softphone applications and unified communication services are the primary form of communication with employees and customers. They are also the primary device for telecommuters who work from home but need to stay in contact with people at work.","VoIP headsets aren&#39;t just for communicating over the internet. They allow you to listen to music or audiobooks with high-quality audio when you&#39;re not chatting. They allow you to communicate with other&#39;s when playing online games. They are ideal for software that converts your speech to editable text. You can also use VoIP headsets for recording podcasts or for dictating notes.","The <a href=\"#Blackwire\">Plantronics Blackwire 700</a>, <a href=\"#Audio_995\">Plantronics .Audio 995</a> and <a href=\"#Jabra\">Jabra UC Voice 750</a> are great examples of VoIP headsets because they have the best audio quality and the comfort features that make these headsets you can wear all day. If you&#39;re interested in learning more, you can read <a href=\"/money\">articles on VoIP headsets</a> in our learning center.","<strong>VoIP Headsets: What to Look For</strong>","Audio quality is paramount. This applies to both the speaker and the microphone. You need your VoIP calls to be clear and your music to be full and rich. In addition, the microphone should have the frequency response range and the noise cancellation technology to make sure that your caller hears you and not your office. Finally, the headset should have features that make it easy to use and the comfort to wear all day long.","Below are some of the criteria you&#39;ll want to consider when choosing a VoIP headset.","<strong>Speaker Audio Performance<br/></strong> The speaker&#39;s ability to reproduce sound is at the core of what makes a good VoIP headset. This begins with the speaker&#39;s frequency response range – the range of audio wavelengths that a speaker is capable of reproducing, measured in hertz. The best USB headsets have a frequency range that can produce bass frequencies as low as 18Hz and frequencies as high as 22kHz.","Most VoIP headset have two headset options: Stereo and Mono. The stereo headset has two speakers that cover both ears while the mono headset only has one speaker. If you&#39;re looking for the best overall audio, the stereo headset is the best choice. It&#39;s like the difference between seeing with one eye or both. However, those around you may find it difficult to get your attention when you&#39;re wearing a stereo headset. For this reason, some offices prefer mono headsets because you can respond to side conversations.","You should also consider a UC headset with acoustic shock protection. While the technology may differ from headset to headset, the idea is the same – a sort of internal circuit breaker that suppresses against potentially dangerous spikes in the decibel level. These acoustic spikes can range from feedback to pops caused by the USB connection. People who wear VoIP headsets for much of the day are particularly susceptible to acoustic shock and can experience symptoms such as tinnitus, headaches, nausea and permanent hearing damage.","<strong>Microphone Audio Performance<br/></strong> Without a microphone, a VoIP headset would just be a set of headphones. The microphone is what turns the headphones into a hands-free communication device. Like the speakers, the microphone has a frequency response range. The difference is that while the frequency range of the speakers represents what the speakers can reproduce, the frequency range of the microphone represents what the microphone can capture and transmit.","The best VoIP headsets have a frequency response range of 20Hz to 16kHz. This wide of a frequency response range makes it ideal for most voice applications like speech-to-text software, podcasts and VoIP calling. This is because it reaches the full range of the human voice. Many UC headsets are only optimized for VoIP calling, which uses a wideband frequency of 100Hz to 7kHz.","<strong>Headset Features<br/></strong> The most important headset feature is the wireless option. Cords are cumbersome. With the average USB headset cord being eight feet long, cords can easily tangle and catch in the wheels of your chair. Also, cords keep you tethered to your computer. However, a wireless headset gives you the range to roam without the noose. In addition, some wireless headsets have the ability to pair with your mobile devices, which means you can take the audio quality of a VoIP headset wherever you go.","The best VoIP headsets have the volume and call controls on the earpiece instead of the cord. This makes the headset easier to use because you don&#39;t have to search the length of the cord for the controls every time you want to answer a call or turn up the volume. In addition, your VoIP headset should be optimized for unified communication services and softphone services like Lync, Cisco and Skype.","<strong>Comfort Features<br/></strong> Most VoIP headsets have the headband style, which has two major pressure points – the vertical pressure of the headband on top of your head and the horizontal pressure of the earpieces pressing against the side of your head. The best UC headsets use a circumaural, or closed-ear, design. This design closes around the ears with the cushions pressing against your head instead of your ears. This also enhances the audio experience by letting less external audio frequencies reach your ear.","In addition, the headband should be padded to ease the vertical pressure. Even the lightest headsets can cause the top of your head to feel sore after hours of use. If you have a sensitive head or you want to avoid messing up your hair, some headsets have different wearing styles, such as the neckband or ear hook. The neckband style wraps around the back of your head while the ear hook is reserved for mono headsets that fit onto one ear with a hook for stability.","<strong>Help &amp; Support<br/></strong> For many businesses, your VoIP headset is the primary means of communication with clients, other employees or managers. If it stops functioning properly, you&#39;ll need a manufacturer with the resources available to help you get back to work as soon as possible. This means that the best USB headset manufacturers have multi-year product warranties, 24/7 telephone support, downloadable manuals and guides, compatibility guides, FAQs pages and audio glossaries.","With more and more of the world&#39;s communication moving to online formats, you want a VoIP headset that enhances your online communication experience instead of discouraging it. This requires a great audio experience, features that are easy to use and comfort that lasts all day.","<strong><b></b>Plantronics Blackwire 700</strong>"]},"id":"0805f976-51db-48d1-9fd8-9b6a982dae6e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Gya7qC3ggprDtudxjYZmoP.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The Plantronics brand has been associated with the manufacturing and creation of some of the best headsets since the 1960s. When Neil Armstrong uttered those famous words on the moon, &#34;That&#39;s one small step for man – one giant leap for mankind,&#34; he did so through a Plantronics headset. While the Plantronics Blackwire 700 series hasn&#39;t been to the moon and back, it has the all-day comfort, versatile connectivity and audio quality to make it one of the best VoIP headsets.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/10173/best-voip-heads-1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gya7qC3ggprDtudxjYZmoP.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"Gya7qC3ggprDtudxjYZmoP","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gya7qC3ggprDtudxjYZmoP.jpg","alt":""},"id":"1a6e6831-fde3-48a8-96bc-524a0882f057","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The most important characteristic of a VoIP headset is the quality of the sound. This applies when you&#39;re listening to music, watching movies, playing games and when you&#39;re video chatting with someone over Lync or Skype. With a 50 mm audio speaker that can produce frequencies between 20Hz and 20kHz, you get a speaker that is capable of reproducing the average range of human hearing. This equates to rich bass and crisp highs. In addition, the stereo models offer calling that has much more depth and clarity than the mono headsets.","Protecting your ears is also important. Extended use of headphones can cause ear fatigue, especially if you listen to music or audio at high decibels. To protect your ears, the Blackwire 700 series USB headset has the SoundGuard technology. This limits the overall volume to 118 decibels. It also detects and dampens sudden acoustic bursts. These bursts can come in the form of pops caused by electronic overload passing through the USB connection, or as overjoyed screams of family members while on Skype.","The SoundGuard doesn&#39;t just protect your ears, it also ensures better audio quality over the life of the headset. Speakers create sound by vibrating and moving the air. The higher the decibels, the more vigorously the speakers must move the air. This movement damages the speakers over time, which causes distortion in the audio. SoundGuard technology helps keep the speakers from clipping – distortion caused by a speaker pushed beyond its capabilities.","The Blackwire&#39;s microphone has a frequency response range of 100Hz to 8kHz. This range reaches well beyond the minimum requirements for wideband audio, making it ideal for VoIP calling. It&#39;s also good for recording audio notes or podcasts. In addition, using this microphone with speech-to-text software allows you to dictate your notes into an editable text format.","The microphone comes with a digital equalizer that filters out background frequencies so that the receiver can hear you over background noises. The noise cancellation technology isn&#39;t as robust as a standard Bluetooth headset, but it&#39;s very effective at eliminating background noise in your home or office.","One of the reasons the Plantronics Blackwire 700 is the best USB headset is it combines the reliability of a corded connection with the versatility of wireless. It connects to your computer via USB port so you can Skype or play online games. However, it also connects to your phone or other A2DP devices with Bluetooth. This means you can use the VoIP headset to make mobile phone calls and stream music.","The Bluetooth connection gives you 33 feet of freedom while the USB cord keeps you tethered to a computer. The USB cord disconnects from the headset at the controls, allowing you to use your headset wherever you go, but also gives you the reliability of a connection when you need it. The controls have a clothing clip, which keeps it easily accessible so you don&#39;t have to search the length of your cord for the controls every time you need to answer a call or pause a song.","Of course, you don&#39;t actually need the controls to answer a call. The Blackwire, like many other Plantronics devices, has smart technology that answers a call when you put on the headset and hangs up when you take it off. In addition, the plug-and-play feature means that you don&#39;t have to worry about installing software just to operate the headset. You only have to plug it into your computer. The Bluetooth connection is equally easy to set up.","Plantronics optimized the Blackwire 700 series for UC services – unified communications programs that streamline the way businesses communicate. These services include instant messengers and softphone applications like Avaya, Lync, Skype and Cisco. In addition, you can purchase the model in a stereo or mono version. While the stereo version provides a much better audio experience, some offices prefer mono headsets because you don&#39;t have to take the headset off your ears every time a co-worker or customer needs to talk to you.","If you often make extended calls, you need a headset that&#39;s comfortable to wear for long periods. Comfort begins with the ear pad design. The design of this headset is on-ear instead of closed-ear. Closed-ear is preferred because it puts the pressure around the ear. The on-ear design puts the pressure on the ear, which can cause ears to get sore after long chatting sessions. In addition, the closed-ear design offers a better audio experience because it doesn&#39;t allow much external sound to interfere with the listening.","An often-overlooked comfort feature is the headband pad. After hours of wearing a headset, you&#39;ll notice that the top of your head where the headband rests can feel sore. A headband pad helps prevent or minimize this soreness. The Blackwire headband has some padding, but the padding isn&#39;t significant enough to make much of a difference.","Plantronics has one of the best support systems for UC headsets. Blackwire 700 series headsets come with 24/7 support and a two-year warranty. In addition, if you want to learn more, there are community forums, a knowledgebase and an extensive glossary of terms to help you understand your product and troubleshoot any potential issues that you come across.","The Plantronics Blackwire 700 is the best VoIP headset because it offers high-quality audio with the SoundGuard protection, which protects your ears from potential damage. With Bluetooth and a detachable USB cord, it offers a versatility that other USB headsets can&#39;t match. The only downside is the on-ear design and the slight padding in the headband, which can cause ear and head soreness when used for long durations.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong><b></b>Plantronics .Audio 995</strong>"]},"id":"721d4f84-66dd-42be-958c-af4c1ce6ee2b","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/wxRKuHoeEhno8TKJamy9a.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The best VoIP headsets provide headphone quality audio with everything you listen to – music, movies, podcasts, games and VoIP calls.

The audio response frequency of the Plantronics .Audio 995 reaches a low of 20Hz and a high of 20kHz. This covers the average frequency range that the average human can hear, making it a great headset for listening to music or for playing online games. This also makes it ideal for VoIP calling because this is more than three times the frequency range of wideband audio.","There are ten .Audio models available in the series – 995, 955, 655 DSP, 648, 628, 626 DSP, 478, 400 DSP, 355 and 326. The major differences between each of these models are wearing style and comfort features. The 995 headset is the top end model with the best audio and best features. The only type of model missing from this series is a mono headset. Each headset comes in stereo, which is the best choice for audio quality. However, some offices prefer mono headsets because the open ear allows employees to respond to people who need their attention in person.","One of the audio features that the series is missing is an acoustic shock protection system. If you&#39;re wearing your USB headset for hours at a time, then you&#39;re very susceptible to experiencing acoustic shock – a sudden increase in the decibel level that can cause hearing damage and other symptoms like tinnitus and headaches. Acoustic shock protection keeps these acoustic bursts from reaching dangerous decibels.","The Plantronics .Audio 995&#39;s microphone has one of the best frequency response ranges. It can capture frequencies as low as 100Hz and as high as 10kHz. This frequency range is 3kHz over the maximum wideband audio for VoIP calling. This means that you&#39;ll get a natural voice tone for calls and better voice quality for speech-to-text software.","To optimize your voice for VoIP calling, the Plantronics .Audio USB headsets have an internal noise-reduction system to filter out background noise so that your callers hear your voice over whatever&#39;s going on around you. Whether you&#39;re in a noisy call-center or you&#39;re at home with a toddler, your voice will cut through it all.","One of the best features of the Plantronics .Audio series is the wireless 995 headset. The .Audio 995 uses a Wi-Fi USB adapter that connects the headset to your computer. This wireless freedom means that you can wander around your home or office while you&#39;re on a VoIP call. Not only does this give you the freedom to roam, but it also eliminates the hassle of a cord that can tangle and catch under office chairs.","In addition, the controls are on the headset. This is an upgrade over a headset with the controls on the cord because the headset doesn&#39;t move. Unless you have a clothing clip, in-line controls move every time you move. So when you want to turn up the volume or mute a call, you have to find the controls. On-ear controls are easier. The headset also has a quick mute feature that mutes the audio when you move the boom microphone upward and unmutes when you pull the microphone back down.","While most UC headsets only control volume and call functions, the .Audio 995, .Audio 655 DSP and .Audio 355 have controls that will control your audio tracks. This means that you can skip, play, pause and rewind your music directly from the headset.","The Plantronics .Audio series has a wide array of wearing styles to fit your desired comfort. The .Audio 648 headset uses a neckband style, which is great for avoiding your hair with a headband. The .Audio 628, 626 DSP, 478, 400 DSP and 326 models all use the on-ear, or supra-aural, design. This places the earpiece on the ear. This generally equates to a lighter headset but leads to sore ears after several hours because the pressure of the earpieces presses against the ear, which is made of soft cartilage.","Fortunately, the .Audio 995, 665 DSP and 355 models use a closed-ear, or circumaural design. This design closes around the ear, which places the pressure against your head. You can wear headsets with this design for hours without ear soreness because there is nothing pressing against your ears. In addition, the circumaural design adds to the audio quality because it lets less external noise reach your ear. Also, the headband pads are thick, which greatly softens the pressure of the headset over the span of the day.","All the UC headsets in the Plantronics .Audio series come with a two-year warranty. Plantronics also offers 24/7 phone support, downloadable guides for all the headsets and a glossary for unfamiliar audio terms.","The Plantronics .Audio 995 is one of the best VoIP headsets because it offers great audio for both you and your caller. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re listening to music or on Skype with an overseas business partner, the speakers have the frequency response range for the best audio reproduction. In addition, the wireless option and the on-ear controls that allow you to control your music tracks make this one of the easiest headsets to use.

This covers the average frequency range that the average human can hear, making it a great headset for listening to music or games when you&#39;re not on a call.","There are two models available with each model in the series – mono and stereo. The stereo option is the far better choice for an all-around quality listening experience for both VoIP calling and other audio because it provides depth to the sound. However, stereo headsets can cause you to become unaware of your surroundings. Mono headsets, which only have one earpiece, are often the preferred choice for office environments where you need to have an open ear available to co-workers or clients.","Another part of the audio quality is the PeakStop protection. This is an internal EQ system designed to recognize and suppress sudden spikes in the decibel level. This helps to prevent acoustic shock, which can damage your hearing and cause other symptoms like tinnitus, nausea and headaches.","The Jabra UC Voice&#39;s microphone has a frequency response range that is consistent with wideband audio.

So while the UC Voice&#39;s microphone is excellent for wideband audio, it&#39;s not ideal for text-to-speech software or vocal recording for podcasts or audio commentaries.","To optimize your voice for VoIP calling, the Jabra UC Voice 750 has an internal noise-reduction system – an active EQ filter that recognizes the background frequencies and filters these from the audio – so that your callers hear your voice over the cacophony of your office or home. In addition, the microphone has a windscreen that absorbs the sound of your breath on the microphone. It also helps to minimize percussive sounds like &#34;P&#34; and &#34;K,&#34; which can cause the audio to clip and distort. It also reduces sibilance – a hissing sound caused by &#34;S&#34; and &#34;Sh.&#34;","A downside to the headset features is the lack of a wireless option. The Jabra UC Voice 750 is marketed as being a headset for mobile employees but keeps you tethered to your computer or laptop with a cord. The nine-foot cord can easily get tangled and caught under desk chair wheels. In addition, the in-line controls mean that you have to search the length of your cord to answer a call or mute a call. Fortunately, the Jabra UC Voice has a clothing clip for the control interface so that you can immediately access it when you need it.","If you&#39;re using your UC headset for work or telecommuting, then you&#39;ll be wearing it for hours at a time. The Jabra UC Voice is designed with this in mind. The earpieces and headband pads are made of a soft leatherette material. The one downside to the design is the on-ear speakers. This design places the horizontal pressure of the headset on the ear, which can cause soreness from all-day wear. A closed-ear design is preferred because it places the pressure on your skull instead of the cartilage of your ear.","All the UC headsets in the Jabra UC Voice series come with a two-year warranty.

In addition, it uses a unidirectional noise cancellation filter that reduces the background noise around you so that your caller can hear you clearly. ","The headset features controls on the earpiece instead of the cord like most UC headsets. This is an improvement over in-line controls because the controls never change location. If you want to change the volume or answer a call, you&#39;ll never have to search for the controls.

This gives you more hours than an average workday with optimal wideband audio for your VoIP calls. However, if you&#39;re someone who works long hours, the narrowband mode extends the battery life to up to fourteen hours. However, this diminishes the higher frequencies from 7 kHz to 3.4 kHz and the lower frequencies from 150 Hz to 300 Hz. Narrowband audio is the traditional frequency range for telephone and VoIP calls, but it lacks the natural sound and clarity of wideband audio.","A flaw in the Logitech H820e is the lack of an acoustic shock protection system. Acoustic shock occurs when there&#39;s an unexpected spike in the decibel level. These acoustic spikes can be the result of feedback, electrical surges, USB connection issues, overly excited callers after receiving good news and more. Acoustic shock can cause hearing damage, tinnitus, headaches and nausea. Acoustic shock protection is especially important in an office environment where you&#39;ll be wearing the headset for most of the workday.","One feature that sets this USB headset apart from the others is a red LED light on the back of the microphone that alerts people when you&#39;re on a call so that you aren&#39;t interrupted.

However, if you have longer workdays, a narrowband mode allows you to switch the audio to narrowband frequencies. The narrowband mode has twelve hours of battery life but constricts the frequency range from 50-6,800 Hz to 300-3,400 Hz. This change to the audio frequency will cause your caller&#39;s voice to sound tinny and flat, which can make it difficult to understand.","To protect your ears from harmful decibel spikes, the Sennheiser DW series of VoIP headsets have ActiveGard – an active internal system that detects and suppresses acoustic shock.

Even the lightest headsets can feel uncomfortable at the end of an eight-hour shift.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/10173/best-voip-heads-15.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TkuLeXpB4HAZhvukWQkTPk.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"TkuLeXpB4HAZhvukWQkTPk","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TkuLeXpB4HAZhvukWQkTPk.jpg","alt":""},"id":"771ecf59-1a20-4a9a-ad91-bceb5df54d94","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The headband style is the favored style for offices because it has the professional appeal of a call-center headset with three-point stability. If you don&#39;t want to mess up your hair or if you have a sensitive scalp, the neckband style wraps around the back of the head. The ear-hook style is popular for Bluetooth headsets because it&#39;s easily mobile. You can fit the ear hook in your pocket when you&#39;re not using the headset. However, the cord will keep you tethered to your computer. In addition, the entire weight of the headset, which includes the cord, pulls on one pressure point on your ear. This can become very uncomfortable after a few hours.","The biggest flaw to the VXi Tria is the audio quality. First, it only comes in a mono version. Mono headsets are used primarily for VoIP calls in offices where a free ear is required, but it isn&#39;t ideal for other audio applications because it lacks depth. Second, the speaker has one of the smallest frequency ranges of the VoIP headsets we reviewed. The speaker&#39;s frequency response starts at 200Hz, which cuts off much of the rich bass frequencies, and ends at 5kHz. This is a full 1.8kHz below the standard range for wideband audio frequencies.","The speaker clearly prioritizes VoIP calling. This is evident in the microphone frequency response, which has a range that is three times as large as the speaker&#39;s frequency. This means that it picks up your voice up better than the speaker can play it. This makes it an ideal USB headset for voice-to-text software.","The speaker comes with an active EQ filter that limits sudden acoustic spikes so that you don&#39;t risk hurting your ears or damaging the speaker. Similar EQ technology exists in the microphone to filter out background noises so that your caller hears your voice over the cacophony of your office or home.","When it comes to VoIP headsets, the VXi Tria&#39;s most notable feature is the three wearing styles – headband, neckband and ear hook. Unfortunately, audio quality is the most important feature with a VoIP headset and the frequency response range is only 200Hz to 5.8kHz. However, it does feature acoustic shock protection.","<a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a>"]},"id":"3a35dffc-d83f-4470-bf48-1ce0fc4d9bf8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10173","url":"/best-voip-headset-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-24T17:33:23Z","datePublished":"2016-10-24T17:33:23Z","name":"Best VoIP Headset Review","synopsis":"Why Buy a VoIP Headset?","review":{},"strapline":"Why Buy a VoIP Headset?","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-25T15:53:54Z","id":"9AsCmarPPybKi6fRZPgqXb","meta":{"title":"Best VoIP Headset Review","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
