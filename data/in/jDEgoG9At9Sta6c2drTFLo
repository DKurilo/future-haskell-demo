The Sony XNV-770BT features an impressive array of multimedia features that are found in many in-dash receivers today. However, the <a href=\"/best-in-dash-navigation-systems\">car GPS navigation</a> part of the unit seems to be missing some of the important features we were looking for in our review. Nevertheless, we would be happy to have the XNV-770BT in-dash navigation system installed in one of our vehicles."]},"id":"1a29140b-125b-4f52-8af8-c888857bd7d9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Navigation &amp; Connectivity"},"id":"b7271d23-a3b8-4208-b776-2191cb7b2eab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The large 7-inch touchscreen is easy to control and will allow you to pick your destination almost effortlessly. The XNV-770BT in-dash navigation uses integrated navigation from TomTom and a Tele Atlas map database. The Tele Atlas database provides you with over 6 million points of interest (POIs). These POIs will help you search for locations by name or type, instead of requiring you to type in an address. You can choose to navigate via a 2D overhead map or a 3D street view map.","Unlike other models we reviewed, this in-dash navigation unit does not have an eco-friendly function. This feature can help you get better gas mileage and reduce your carbon footprint. In a world where everyone is becoming more earth-conscious, it’s disappointing to see this feature missing on this Sony GPS.","There also does not seem to be any voice control feature for the XNV-770BT in-dash navigation. You can get voice guidance from the machine, and receive turn-by-turn directions as you drive, but it doesn’t seem as if you can give simple commands to the system. This is disappointing because voice commands help you keep your eyes on the road and let you concentrate on driving."]},"id":"734498f2-6eee-47c2-a120-1c6d533fd8c3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Features"},"id":"de880415-cf90-4b8f-9da4-9fe3016711c0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It is in the additional features that this Sony in-dash navigation system really shines.
