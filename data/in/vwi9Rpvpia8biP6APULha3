Also consider whether you can save your searches and marked locations. No matter what you use your maps for, being able to save your searches and pinpoint exact locations is a must. Finally consider, if the online map site offers helpful suggestions and tips for those times when you are stuck or just want to learn how to efficiently use the program.","While your purpose for using an online map may differ from the next person’s, these general ease of use considerations apply to all maps.
