The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-dvd-ripper-software\">DVD Ripper Software</a> here.</em>","Express Burn has many of the key features we look for in DVD ripping software. In addition to having one of the fastest ripping speeds, Express Burn also captures and provides high-quality audio and video sound for each movie you rip. We were impressed with the features, the ease and the quality. The reason Express Burn didn’t rank higher on our side-by-side comparison of DVD ripping software is because it lacks CSS decryption, making it impossible to rip commercial DVDs. The majority of users purchase DVD ripping software to create backup or portable files of their favorite movies and TV shows.","There are several key features that we highlight in our comparison of DVD ripper software. One of those key features is the time it takes to rip a DVD. Using Express Burn we were able to rip a 113 minute video in a mere 20 minutes. Only one other application gave us the same speed. In addition to the excellent speed, there are several other features that make this choice one of the top DVD ripping software options available. Express Burn will copy your ripped DVDs to your computer’s hard drive, allow you to omit or keep bonus material and provide you with the ability to rip episodic DVDs – all features that we would not suggest doing without.","We were disappointed that the application lacks the ability to legally decrypt codes for commercial DVDs. You won’t run into problems with every commercial DVD, but the application isn’t designed for that purpose so you will likely have more problems than not. This is a large aspect to overlook and dropped the ranking of Express Burn drastically.","In addition to DVDs, Express Burn has the ability to rip Blu-rays and CDs. Your computer will need the proper drives to run the discs, but there are presets available within the application to quickly and easily perform rips on any of the three formats. The design of the interface is very easy to follow and easy to use, making it a user-friendly application. We spent little time looking for the different features we wanted to use, but instead were able to quickly find and access them because of the clean and organized layout.","Express Burn didn’t offer a great deal of help and support resources to assist the user with DVD ripping. Through their website you will find a list of frequently asked questions as well as a user forum. There is also a form that you can fill out to ask a question or make a comment. The representatives were very helpful and responded to our inquiries rather quickly. We were impressed with the customer support but wish there had been more resources available in terms of tutorials and a manual."]},"id":"4c603c94-5ba3-4991-bdb4-a615ed3a3dbc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"480d1678-831f-47f9-adfd-564be30a7ea0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Express Burn offers exactly what the name suggests, a quick DVD rip.

While some users may not find these features to be necessary, they are very beneficial and make the ripping process easier and flow more smoothly.
