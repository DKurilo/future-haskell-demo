Outsourcing your billing to a third-party service is a great way to reduce overhead and free up resources.  ","<strong><strong>Outsourced vs. In-House Billing</strong></strong>","Whether to contract with a medical billing service rather than keeping your billing in-house depends entirely on how large your practice is, how much revenue you take in and how you utilize your staff. When doing billing in-house, you will need a certified medical coder on staff to oversee billing. You will also need to keep up with ever-changing medical laws and codes. Numerous things can go wrong with a medical claim, such as a simple coding error, which will make insurance companies reject them. It will be up to you and your staff to deal with rejected claims if you do in-house billing. Billing services take care of all of that for you, so it’s up to them stay on top of drafting claims.","Cost can ultimately determine which is the smart choice for your practice. In-house billing requires payroll for a medical coder and usually an annual license for medical billing software. Someone with this certification will cost more to employ than an average clinical staff member, and taking care of claims will likely be their full-time responsibility. Billing services often have a one-time setup fee that includes training you on how to use it and implementing it on your computer system, in addition to a percentage of the total cost of each claim they process. This percentage is usually negotiated and determined depending on the size of your practice, but it can end up being 4% to 9% of each claim. You should be able to calculate what makes financial sense for your practice. On a perfunctory level, you must consider a medical coder’s salary, vs. the speculative cost of service’s “commission” on your annual revenue from claims, though there are many other costs to your practice to consider for each route.","Outsourced billing can be a good solution for small practices that need their staff to focus on other aspects of running the office. Having one person on payroll as a medical coder may not make sense budget-wise with the number of patients the practice serves. For larger practices and hospitals, a billing service may not be as worth it if you have the budget for medical coders and have a large volume of claims that the service will charge a percentage of for each."]},"id":"41ab8acd-5097-4fad-8ebe-703db3d24898","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"<strong>Medical Billing Services: Our Verdict &amp; Recommendations</strong>"},"id":"dcaa3cd0-5a21-4d91-a848-dcbfcf68ee3f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For about five years, we have examined the top companies in the field to determine how they rank up next each other. We look to see if these companies offer the essential features to help your practice increase its revenue and run the billing aspect of it efficiently.","We found <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/advancedmd-medical-billing-services/\">AdvancedMD</a> to be the front-runner of the best medical billing services. This cloud-based solution will handle all of your medical billing needs, while also delivering robust patient management and EHR interfaces. The AdvancedInsight feature allows you to analyze your practice’s revenue cycle and study industry trends, all while consulting you on where you could improve.","Our second choice, <a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/kareo-medical-billing-services/\">Kareo</a>, features a customizable interface that lets you give different staff members different levels of access to the billing section, patient management and EHR screens, which are free with the service. It also handles patient questions and concerns on billing, freeing you and your staff up to focus on other things.","<a href=\"https://www.business.com/reviews/eclinicalworks/\">eClinicalWorks</a>, ranking third in our review, is a leading billing service that is highly customizable and comes with its robust patient management and EHR programs. With a telemedicine platform, this service can be your all-in-one digital infrastructure.","<strong><strong>What We Evaluated, What We Found</strong></strong>","Medical billing services should improve your collection rate, reduce claim denials and make things easier overall on your staff. This is their primary purpose, but they also have many other benefits for your practice, so watch for some of those features to improve efficiency in your office.","<strong>Billing </strong>","When working with a medical billing service, your staff just needs to input a patient’s information and the cost of their visit. The service’s billing experts take care of verifying the patient&#39;s insurance standing, drafting claims, making sure they pass rigorous medical coding standards and then submitting them to the insurance provider. This is called claim scrubbing. They follow up with the insurance provider to confirm the claim went through and transfer payment to you. If a claim is rejected, it’s the billing service’s responsibility to find out what was wrong with the claim and fix it.","The service sends out the statements to your patients. It also provides customer support to them if they have questions or concerns about their bills, and transfers unpaid balances to collection agencies if necessary.","This process is complicated and can be time-consuming depending on the volume of patients your practice sees. This is usually the full-time duty of a staff member, who must also have a certification in medical coding.","<strong>Interface Features</strong>","Outsourced services do all the heavy lifting on billing, but they still provide an interface for you and your staff to enter in patient and insurance information. All the services in our review have a cloud-based interface, which works through a web browser or other app, yet the software and all your data is hosted off-site. You won’t need a top-of-the-line computer, but your office will still need a decent internet connection to transfer your data.","On the patient’s end, there is also an online portal for them to log in to in order to make payments, request appointments and view test results. Some of the bigger services also feature telemedicine tools that allow patients to remotely communicate with their doctors, such as an instant messenger and video chat. ","<strong>Patient Management &amp; EHR </strong>","Since patient management tools and electronic health records (EHR/EMR) are also essential tools for running a medical practice, many billing services offer these programs as part of a suite of software solutions. Since these programs share much of the information and data, it makes sense to go with programs that are compatible and part of the same system. However, some programs in our review are compatible with other third-party software in case you prefer another EHR over the one the billing service offers. Many services have mobile apps to let you access your records through a smartphone or tablet.","Of course, these programs must adhere to medical law and codes, including ICD-10 and HIPAA. Many of the programs also offer support for Meaningful Use, an incentive program for medical practices to successfully utilize technology for the benefit of patients.","<strong>Support</strong>","The best medical billing services should have plenty of channels for support, including phone, email and live messaging. Your service should provide training through either in-person instruction or video webinars to teach you and your staff how to use its features. An additional service that companies often provide is consultation on how to improve your practice’s revenue cycle. Taking data from patient claims and the rate of successful reimbursements, the service can compare your practice to others of a similar size and provide you with insight on where you could be improving."]},"id":"44bad4fe-ea88-4827-a8c3-0870ad9821db","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Medical billing services can be a boon to medical practices that are striving to meet the needs of their patients but also to increase revenue.
