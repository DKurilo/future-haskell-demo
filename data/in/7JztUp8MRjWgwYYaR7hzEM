You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The cheery blue Bissell Rewind SmartClean was a little bulky and difficult to maneuver but it does a fine job of cleaning carpet and an OK job cleaning hard flooring. This 17.5-pound <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">upright vacuum</a> is relatively easy to unpack and assemble, taking only 4.5 minutes during our testing. You do need to affix one screw to attach the handle, which slides in, but that takes little time.","It comes with a dual-sided combination dusting brush and upholstery tool, a turbo-brush for pet hair, a wand, and a crevice tool. On the back, you will find a rather large storage area for the retractable electrical cord. This compartment does not get in the way of the hose or any cleaning, and the cord retracts quickly and easily with just the push of a button.","The on-off button is on the side of the base, and you get five height-control levels that you adjust manually. However, that means you have to bend over to adjust these controls.","Our testing showed that this upright bagless vacuum cleaned cereal and pet hair off of carpeting smoothly. It struggled a bit with kitty litter and flour on all different surfaces, but so did most of the competition.","It is a little noisy, with a measured decibel level of 88 dB, but it is not exceptionally loud. You get some help with this machine as well since it is equipped with a clean carpet sensor (which really works) that shows a red light when the vacuum moves over dirty carpet and a green light when it passes across clean carpet. You also get a light indicator that alerts you when you need to change filters.","This upright vacuum cleaner is more difficult to maneuver than many of the others. There is only one handle so getting it up and down stairs will be a chore. Also, a rubber ring around the bottom of the cleaning head – designed to protect furniture legs – came off for no apparent reason when we were vacuuming carpet.","This vacuum is equipped with a HEPA filter on one side, which means you will be clearing away a good deal of dust and allergens that lurk inside even the cleanest home. You cannot wash this filter, but you can remove it and shake it out every once in a while to keep it free of dust. There is another sponge-like circular filter inside the dirt cup area that you can wash with warm water and detergent. However, Bissell recommends replacing filters every three to six months."]},"id":"cb6ed415-b13c-49db-a518-1e5b9fa6d740","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9b811cd4-736b-43cd-b198-f3f4340e580d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bissell Rewind SmartClean is a handy and nicely functional upright bagless vacuum that does well on carpets and offers a couple of handy sensor lights.
