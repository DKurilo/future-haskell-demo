A mobile wallet is an app that allows mobile phone users to store credit cards, debit cards, store cards and often award or gift cards in one app. Instead of digging through their wallet at the point of sale, customers select their payment method in their phone&#39;s app and use near-field-communication (NFC) technology or magnetic stripe readers to send information to the payment processor.","Experts disagree on the projected revenue and usage numbers; however, they all agree that mobile payment usage and sales volume will increase. eMarketer reported that mobile transactions are expected to increase in 2016 to a volume of roughly 27 billion and twice that much in 2017. As usage increases, you&#39;ll want to consider if adding mobile wallet payment processing makes sense for your business.","<strong>Are Mobile Wallets Catching On?</strong><br/>If you have yet to adopt processing mobile phone payments, you are not alone. It has been slow to catch on, partially due to the fact that this new method is not that much easier than using cash or a card in the traditional manner.","iPhone is preinstalling Apply Pay on its newer iPhones, and Android Pay and Samsung Pay are gaining usage as well. However, currently, many digital wallet users try out the app but don&#39;t return to using it often. So even though statistics show a large volume of users, repeat usage is still low.","<strong>Will EMV Compliance Tip the Market?</strong><br/>It might. Processing chip cards is proving to be slow and annoying to both merchants and customers. If mobile wallet processing proves to be faster and easier than using a chip card, patrons may flock to mobile wallets for convenience. And, most security professionals say that mobile wallets are just as safe as EMV chip cards.","<strong>Who Uses Mobile Wallets?</strong><br/>Basically, millennials and high-income consumers. Mobile wallet usage is increasing as younger consumers move into the market. Older users tend to distrust the technology, whereas younger users are more likely to be comfortable with app payment processing, online purchases and P2P transactions in general. Most usage statistics also show that more affluent consumers are more likely to use mobile wallets, often for travel and awards programs.","<strong>Do the Big Three Work with Loyalty Programs?</strong><br/>One factor that has contributed to increasing mobile wallet usage is due to the businesses consumers patronize rather than the features of mobile wallets or incentives offered by mobile pay companies. For example, many users are adopting digital wallets for tracking loyalty programs, managing discount programs and for travel programs (boarding passes). However, often these types of mobile wallet programs are store specific, which means, it&#39;s another app for your customers to have on their phone.","These types of programs are becoming popular, and services such as Urban Airship can help create one for your business. Starbucks has one of the most popular loyalty programs that has proved successful for them. For now, unless you want to create your own app, you can work with one of the big mobile pay providers to accept regular credit and debit card payments.","<strong>What Do I Need So I Can Accept Mobile Wallets?</strong><br/>The first thing you will need is the proper type of card reader or credit card terminal for the targeted app. Most terminals work with NFC card readers and some also work with magnetic card readers.","Next, request a merchant kit or merchant checklist from the mobile wallet company. This kit will have all the information you need to start processing payments. You&#39;ll also want to consult with your point-of-sale company and merchant service, or payment processing company, to make sure you set up everything correctly to process these types of transactions. The mobile wallet company will provide you with stickers and logos so you can easily advertise to customers the types of payments you can process.","<strong>The Big Players: Android, Apply and Samsung Pay</strong>","<strong>Android Pay</strong><br/>Processes credit, debit, loyalty and gift cards.

Apply Pay comes preinstalled. While Samsung works with more banks, it works on fewer devices than Android, and may suffer from Samsung’s recent issues. It all comes down to preference and availability. You&#39;ll likely be most successful by simply asking your customers what app they prefer. Another option is that you can pick the app that supports the most banks in your area. Or, you can choose to process more than one type of wallet, since it doesn&#39;t cost you more to do so.","To learn more about mobile wallets from the consumer perspective, see <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/mobile-wallet-guide,news-20666.html\">Mobile Wallets Reviews</a>."]},"id":"46577669-ee39-40f2-a679-ec82853da833","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10207","url":"/mobile-wallets-war","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"pamela-s-stevens","url":"/author/pamela-s-stevens","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Pamela S Stevens","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"e9bBMEAQ9LLhA3c2cSq39Z","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-27T14:08:08Z","datePublished":"2016-10-27T14:08:08Z","name":"Who's Winning  the Mobile Wallet War - Apple, Android or Samsung Pay?","synopsis":"Accepting mobile wallet payments does not cost business owners more than what it costs to process a card-present transaction.","review":{},"strapline":"Accepting mobile wallet payments does not cost business owners more than what it costs to process a card-present transaction.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-10-27T14:12:54Z","id":"AiPS6dnBGCgEtzEijJoQjR","meta":{"title":"Who's Winning  the Mobile Wallet War - Apple, Android or Samsung Pay?","description":"Is it time to accept mobile wallet payments?
