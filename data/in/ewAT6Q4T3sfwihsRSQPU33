While Bank of America rescinded its decision after a public outcry, earlier in 2011, other national and regional banks, including JP Morgan Chase, SunTrust (Atlanta) and Wells Fargo, tested card fees in select markets. These banks also abandoned their plans to assess bank card fees.","So the obvious question is this: Why do banks try to charge these fees when customers have gone without paying them for a long time? The answer is grounded in how banks run their businesses and the added pressures of the recent economic climate.","First, remember that the simplest form of banking allows you to open checking and savings accounts with low or no interest paid to you. In return for your deposits, you get a safe place to keep your money, easy access to it and the ability to write checks. The bank gets more money to lend to its larger customers every month. In other words, your money is used to lend to others who pay high rates of interest, which in turn produces income for the bank.","Back to the reasons for those bank card fees. There are several. When it comes to debit cards, your life is simpler when you use an automated teller machine, or ATM, to get cash. However, the bank has to pay to maintain those machines. They must routinely be filled with cash, and that cash is handled inside the bank branch itself. ATM maintenance costs the bank money for labor and security.","Another reason for bank card fees revolves around something called interchange rates. When you use your ATM card at a machine not owned by the bank that issued the card, your own bank is required to pay a fee to the bank that owns the machine you used. This interchange rate is more than 30 cents per transaction, and this cost is passed on to you as a fee, often payable right at the machine at the time of your withdrawal. As you may have concluded, ATM fees more than cover interchange costs, so the extra few dollars goes directly to the banks&#39; bottom line.","Aside from recouping costs, the next big reason for bank card fees is simple profit. Banks must constantly increase their streams of revenue, and very often, raising fees seems to be a good way to do that, from the banks&#39; perspective. This is why you&#39;ll often see fee increases, which are sometimes small enough to miss, on your checking account. If enough customers begin paying small fees, the total amount coming in adds up to additional profit for the banks. Bank profits also rely heavily on credit card processing fees.","While the reasons for bank card fees may be straightforward and in some cases make sense, as a consumer, you want to avoid them whenever you can. If your bank announces that it plans to start charging you a monthly fee to use your debit card when previously there was no charge, talk with a banker. Ask for the fee to be waived. If that doesn&#39;t work, switch to a credit union that will issue you a fee-free ATM and debit card.","Even if your bank doesn&#39;t charge you a monthly fee to use your card, you&#39;re still paying additional fees when you visit the ATMs of other banks. Organize your cash withdrawals to coincide with the days of the week when you&#39;re closest to an ATM belonging to your own bank. Determine never to use another bank&#39;s ATMs again, and you&#39;ll save a bundle of money over the course of a year. Or, you can just use your debit card to pay for groceries and ask for cash back, which will eliminate the need to visit ATMs altogether.","Also, keep an eye on the fees you&#39;re paying for credit card processing. This is another area where fees can sneak in without you realizing it, and the reasons for higher credit card fees mirror those listed above."]},"id":"d889e644-3d0c-4a9e-a887-9f420ce7db0d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7089","url":"/whats-the-deal-with-bank-card-fees","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-hicks","url":"/author/jennifer-hicks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Hicks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"m6DJLsYwJmcJdjxe4yY9kY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-03-21T14:41:43Z","datePublished":"2012-03-21T14:41:43Z","name":"What's the Deal with Bank Card Fees?","synopsis":"After the 2011 flap over Bank of America's decision to charge its customers $5 per month to use their debit cards, consumers began demanding to know the reasons for bank card fees.","review":{},"strapline":"After the 2011 flap over Bank of America's decision to charge its customers $5 per month to use their debit cards, consumers began demanding to know the reasons for bank card fees.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-05-31T22:09:06Z","id":"ewAT6Q4T3sfwihsRSQPU33","meta":{"title":"What's the Deal with Bank Card Fees?","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
