OM115LD is an excellent example of how educational toys for kids can encourage learning while still being fun to use. This <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43718-best-microscopes-for-kids.html\">kids microscope</a> offers quality optics, engaging instructional materials and a multitude of potential discoveries for your child.","Your child can use this microscope to view both slides and solid objects. The high-quality LED lighting above and below the stage offers great views of either. You can examine insects, cloth, feathers and anything else of interest when you use the lighting above the stage. Using the light below the stage, you can view slides that come with the microscope or make your own slides using pond water, cells from the inside of your mouth and other cool things to look at under a microscope.","The optics are noticeably good – much better than what you might expect for a children&#39;s microscope. We saw high-quality images of the included slides as well as our testing slides – onion skin, a honeybee leg and a pumpkin stem. Although the optics are similar to those of the top-ranking products, we found the OM115LD to be slightly weaker on some views, especially the translucent items, lit from below. Differences in lighting led to a slightly duller image on the OM115LD, although it was still strong overall.","The OM115LD&#39;s 10x eyepiece works in congruence with three objective lenses – 4x, 10x and 40x – to give you accurate views of a wide range of specimens. You can adjust the six-hole diaphragm to allow just the right amount of light in for every circumstance. &#34;It can see very well,&#34; wrote one of our young panelists during testing.","This student microscope is incredibly easy to use, and the metal construction means that it can handle some abuse from kids. There aren’t any of the plastic, breakable parts that you will find with toy microscopes. This looks and feels like lab-quality equipment, only on a smaller scale. The Omano OM115LD is also cordless, making it easy to move around. Your child can take it into the backyard for exploring. The included dust cover is better than no cover at all, but a carrying case and handle would be nicer for both storage and transport.","You can buy this microscope with only its standard gift package, but we reviewed a set with Pack 2, which adds a slide and stain kit. All models come with five slides and a book. The included set alone can offer a solid starting place for a young scientist. The included book, &#34;The World of the Microscope,&#34; offers beautiful illustrations and useful information. It has ideas for experiments your child can try as they use their Omano microscope. It will take a long time to get through all of the ideas in the book, and by that time, your child will likely have thought of many more things on their own that they want to examine with their microscope.","Omano is the house brand of Microscope.com, which is essentially the manufacturer and the entity that provides all customer support for this product. Microscope.com is responsive to customer concerns. We received fast and friendly responses to our inquiries by phone, email and live chat. You can get your money back if you are not satisfied and return the product within 25 days. The warranty is only six months, though, which is short compared to its competitors&#39; warranties, some of which last the lifetime of the products."]},"id":"15a9f105-cda4-412e-8cfc-4f89a00c21dd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"342cde98-8260-4916-9731-1f49c450e5c3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Like all the best kids microscopes, the Omano OM115LD emphasizes science but provides plenty of opportunities for fun.
