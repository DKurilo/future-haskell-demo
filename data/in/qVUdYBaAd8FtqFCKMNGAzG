This tomahawk is made for survival, so it incorporates some of the most important tools you&#39;ll need.","Naturally, this camp axe cuts well. The stay-sharp blade and overall excellent balance means that even though the axe weighs just 19.5 ounces and measures just over 12 inches, it can handle most campfire and site-clearing needs. Our testers found it made short work of limbs, logs and small stumps, although the shape of the blade had a tendency to catch in bushes and roots.","However, the SOG Survival Hawk can do more than cut: The blade is part of a multi-purpose head. You can hammer using the center, and pry and pull up nails with the narrow end. This end is also sharp enough to cut bulky wire and act as a claw. On a trip in Chile, our testers used it to grab and drag logs. The head itself is 2CR, 47-49 harness steel, which is about average for axes. The scale runs 45-55 for axes, while knife blades are 55 and over. The handle is glass-reinforced nylon.","This survival axe also has some extras to assist the camper or survivalist. The handle is wrapped in paracord which you can remove to use in an emergency. In the handle, you&#39;ll find a ferrocerium firestarter rod. The sheath is made of ballistic nylon and contains a snap closure and belt loop so you can attach the axe to your backpack or belt for easy carrying.","There were a couple of downsides to this camping hatchet, however. In addition to the blade catching on bushes, our testers found the handle could get slippery, and while black is always an awesome color, it could easily get lost in said bushes.","SOG Specialty Knives and Tools, LLC has an excellent reputation for quality products, and it offers a lifetime warranty against defects. Even better, it has free sharpening service and pays to ship. It&#39;s worth taking advantage of this after a trip where you used it a lot, or at the end of the season so it&#39;s ready for next spring&#39;s camping adventure."]},"id":"ecae3206-58be-40ec-8e2e-8f7416f5a6c8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68358","url":"/sog-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-12T18:42:16Z","datePublished":"2016-09-12T18:42:16Z","name":"SOG Survival Hawk","synopsis":"The key attribute for the SOG Survival Hawk is \"Utility,\" but this light and durable camping axe has a lot more going for it as well.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The key attribute for the SOG Survival Hawk is \"Utility,\" but this light and durable camping axe has a lot more going for it as well.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-12T18:42:16Z","id":"qVUdYBaAd8FtqFCKMNGAzG","meta":{"title":"SOG Survival Hawk Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Light and functional, the SOG Survival Hawk is a great multipurpose camping axe.
