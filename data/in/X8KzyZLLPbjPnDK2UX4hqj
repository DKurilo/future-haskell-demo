This drawing program for Mac is an uncomplicated system that still offers a good amount of features and tools, some of which are customizable.","This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/652-best-drawing-apps.html\">drawing app for Mac</a> is easy to use. It has multiple drawing and painting tools that let you manage colors and customize canvas size. It does not offer a mixing palette, though, so you can’t create custom colors. It also lets you work in layers and offers tracing tools, in case you would rather trace than draw freehand. These tools help you create drawings free of rough edges.","In total, you can choose from 15 different tools, including stencils, pens, pencils and airbrushes. In case you want a break from sketching, ArtRage offers painting tools such as oil brushes, watercolor brushes and even chalk. For more options, you can customize your brushes.","ArtRage uses mostly traditional art tools. Unlike other drawing apps, it does not offer structured tools such as shape builders and grids. This software is not a good tool to create interior designs or graphics. ArtRage is best for freehand drawing and painting.","ArtRage offers more compatibility options than other Mac drawing programs. This system works on both PC and Mac desktops. In addition, it works with iPad and Android tablets. There is also a version you can download on your smartphone. This wide compatibility makes ArtRage a good choice for drawing on the go.","If you need help learning how to use ArtRage, the company offers extensive support. You can join the member area and participate in the art forums. You can also watch step-by-step art tutorials to hone your craft. If your software is having issues, you can contact technical support by sending an email ticket or explore the user manual, which addresses the technical setup of the software.","ArtRage is a simple Mac drawing software that lets you customize your drawing tools. In addition to offering a good selection of drawing tools, ArtRage offers painting tools so you can create all different kinds of art. It is missing a color palette, so you can’t create custom colors. Furthermore, it is compatible with tablets and smartphones, in addition to desktop computers."]},"id":"0a6e2583-1e50-4997-af95-3c8a869bcedd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68557","url":"/artrage-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-17T13:56:08Z","datePublished":"2016-10-17T13:56:08Z","name":"ArtRage","synopsis":"ArtRage is a good app for drawing and sketching.
