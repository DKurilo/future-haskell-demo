It is one of the few applications in our accelerated reading software lineup that doesn&#39;t use the technique where groups of words flash on your screen to increase the eye&#39;s fixation span. Instead, the software primarily uses highlighted word groups. It displays the full text, with groups of words bolded as you read along. Highlighted word groups are a proven method for teaching speed-reading, but most speed-reading companies consider the flash method better.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/1053-ultimate-speed-reader1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ujxgZSRC65PG7eFqoCwBN.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"8ujxgZSRC65PG7eFqoCwBN","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ujxgZSRC65PG7eFqoCwBN.jpg","alt":""},"id":"19e0378c-0e5d-4cc8-b683-4c7963e5e63a","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In addition to its six-level training program, this accelerated-reading software includes an eye game, paced reading, timed reading and newspaper reading. You can practice any of these at your leisure to supplement the training program. Ultimate Speed Reader also provides eye-strengthening exercises. Eye strength plays an important role in learning how to read faster, as it increases your peripheral vision and fixation span. This software also lets you practice reading vertical columns of text and standard book-sized horizontal lines of prose.","Ultimate Speed Reader will work for both children and adults, though it only allows one user per license. The software does not designate specific reading levels or grades, but you can manually adjust the words-per-minute rate and choose age-appropriate reading material for each user.","In terms of reading material, the speed-reading software includes only book passages â€“ no full eBooks. Unfortunately, these passages are your only option for reading material in Ultimate Speed Reader; you cannot import your own documents or web text. This doesn&#39;t negate the validity of the lessons, but it could make it tedious if you aren&#39;t enjoying the material or if you want to use this program to keep your skills fresh and end up reading the same material over again.","Knowledge Adventure, a reputable producer of educational computer programs and games, produced this software, but no longer supports it.
