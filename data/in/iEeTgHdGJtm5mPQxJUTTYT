It lacks many of the more advanced features found in the best webcams, like the Logitech HD Pro C920. Despite this, the webcam is hardworking, provides good audio and video quality overall and is easy to use.","This web camera can shoot 16:9 cinematic video in up to 720p, which is basic high-resolution. You can capture video at up to 30fps at 720p, which is decent, though other webcams can shoot 30fps at 1080p (full HD). If that difference in resolution isn’t a big deal to you, then the LifeCam HD-3000 is a good option. However, if you plan on taking lots of still photos, the unit may not cut it, as its still image resolution is a disappointing 4 megapixels. Microsoft’s TrueColor technology enhances the LifeCam’s brightness and color under most lighting conditions.","The HD-3000’s lens has a fixed focus and lets you digitally zoom in on an image up to 4x. Its microphone has an integrated noise reducer, so it automatically reduces or eliminates background noise in any video you record. Built-in social media sharing lets you share those videos to friends and followers on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. The HD-3000 is also compatible with Skype for Business.","With a cord length of 4.9 feet, you should have enough room to get the HD-3000 set up just where you want it in your office. Tilt and pan functionality allow you to tailor your webcam’s view even more. The PC camera is compatible with Windows XP, 7, 8, 8.1 and 10, although the TrueColor function is only supported on Windows 8 or later.","The LifeCam ships with an impressive three-year limited warranty from the manufacturer, longer than any other unit we reviewed. Customer support for the webcam is available directly, although you may not need it if your questions are answered in the available user manual and FAQs section on Microsoft’s website."," "]},"id":"f282f7b2-e400-433f-a515-43161b98001d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1dae8a81-b69b-4d1b-b9a8-8c7a02c86732","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 lives up to expectations and stands true to the specs provided.
