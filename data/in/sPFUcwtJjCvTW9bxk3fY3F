You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Maytag Centennial <a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\">top-load washing machine</a> is a standard-capacity (3.4 cubic feet) washer that follows the old-school dual-action agitator model. It is less expensive than many modern washing machines, in part because of its ceramic basket– a style that has been largely supplanted by stainless steel. It features a surprisingly quiet wash for an agitator-style machine, and is capable of detecting and correcting load imbalances.","The wash cycles on this unit are as basic as can be. You manually select hot, warm or cold water; heavy-duty, normal or delicate wash; and whether to employ an extra rinse cycle. If you crave manual control, this could be a plus, but don&#39;t expect the machine to do any of the thinking for you.","Many of this unit&#39;s wash cycles take more than an hour to complete. It is tougher on clothes than newer impeller-style washers. Its maximum spin speed is 700 rpm, which is the slowest of any unit we reviewed. That said, while it won&#39;t wring all moisture out of your clothes, the spin cycle does seem adequate.","The Maytag Centennial is not Energy Star certified, and it uses more water and energy than almost any other model we reviewed. It lacks the sophisticated cycles and automatic technology of most of today&#39;s washing machines. And Maytag&#39;s one-year warranty for parts and labor does not fill us with confidence. We recommend finding a manufacturer that trusts its product enough to offer a 10-year motor warranty; it will save you money on repair costs in the long run.","This unit has a lid-lock mechanism, which should be an attractive safety point. However, it does not have a separate detergent dispenser, which means you must pour the detergent into the bottom of the basket. Since the basket doesn&#39;t fill with water until after the lid is closed and locked, there is no way to dilute the detergent before piling your laundry atop it. In practice, this can mean detergent residue on clothing even after the wash and rinse cycles are finished."]},"id":"32712bd8-bf5e-4656-bb6e-056049945a5f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e76a6366-403b-45bb-b6d2-9e9c6ada4a23","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Maytag Centennial is not expensive, if you choose to buy it, you may wish you had spent a little more money in exchange for a better warranty and an overall better-working top-load washing machine."]},"id":"dec514d7-6754-4a59-b783-f8f5576cc333","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56283","url":"/maytag-centennial-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-04-27T01:21:01Z","datePublished":"2013-04-27T01:21:01Z","name":"Maytag Centennial MVWC200XW","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.
