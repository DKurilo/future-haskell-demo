It’s cloud-based and made for use with iOS devices, both mobile and desktop. Anybody with an iCloud account, including PC and Windows users, can use Apple Numbers. The whole software suite is designed for remote, web-based use, so it has plenty of collaborative capabilities.","While Apple regularly updates the functionality, flexibility and compatibility of Numbers, there are still some restrictions. Which file formats you can import and export depend on whether you’re using the Numbers <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-microsoft-office-alternatives\">Spreadsheet</a> version for iCloud, Mac or iOS. Some editions can import and export XLS and XLSX files, while others can only deal with XLSX. Numbers can handle CSV files as well as PDF and tab-delimited text files, but it cannot import or export other common formats like HTML and ODF.","Although Numbers is basically compatible with Microsoft Excel, some things don’t render correctly when you open Excel files in Numbers, and a number of Excel functions aren&#39;t supported at all, which can cause issues. For example, Numbers does not support background formatting, frozen panes, protected ranges, image layout, locked cells, data validation or pivot tables. Excel macros and Track Changes are also incompatible with Apple Numbers.","Numbers has a large repository of supported formulas, but a number of advanced ones are not supported, such as most database, cube and engineering functions. However, there are still supported formulas and functions to satisfy the requirements of most spreadsheets. You can start with a blank sheet or use one of the many available templates and insert animated charts and graphs, 2D and 3D charts, graphics, and images.","This cloud-based office software has a heavy focus on easy collaboration. You and those you share your files with can access them from anywhere with an internet connection, provided you&#39;re signed in to iCloud. You can use this spreadsheet software with mobile and desktop devices, but each user has to have an iCloud account to make or access files. It supports multiple users and allows simultaneous editing in real time. To further enhance collaboration, Numbers has messaging and commenting support so you can communicate with colleagues inside the worksheet itself, rather than having to leave Numbers to chat via a separate messaging system.","As you’d expect from an Apple product, you have access to solid support. The customer service includes telephone and email support, as well as online self-help, troubleshooting, forums and tutorials."]},"id":"661707ed-3315-4b5d-b121-c733a89ae29b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68699","url":"/apple-numbers-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-03T16:29:03Z","datePublished":"2016-11-03T16:29:03Z","name":"Apple Numbers","synopsis":"Apple Numbers is part of Apple’s homegrown office suite, iWork.
