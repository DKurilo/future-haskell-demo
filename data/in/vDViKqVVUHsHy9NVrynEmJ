The Sony DVP-FX820 features sleek, compact styling. The player is available in black, blue, red, pink, or white. The controls are located neatly below the screen. Like most <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">portable DVD players</a>, the screen folds onto the main body to allow for easier transport, much like a laptop.","With 6 hours of battery life there won’t be any lack of entertainment options on your next long trip. 6 hours is enough to watch 3 movies back to back to back. It can also get you from one coast to the other in an airplane. The battery is also rechargeable and the unit can be used while it’s charging.","The 8 inch LCD screen is large enough to comfortably view movies while it rests on your lap. It is also large enough to allow 2 people to view the screen at the same time. It even has 2 headphone jacks or you can use the built-in speakers.","Changing tracks or fast forwarding is easier with the DVP-FX820. It has dual remote sensors; one located on the screen and the other on the body. This means that you won’t have to aim your remote control to perform various functions.","The screen has the ability to swivel up to 180 degrees to allow for easier viewing. This allows the user to tilt or swivel the screen to the perfect viewing angle. The screen also has an anti-glare coating to help keep unwanted reflections at bay.","The DVP-FX820 will play not only DVDs but CDs and MP3s. Simply load a CD-R with your favorite tunes and you’re set. The drive will also read most picture formats to make it easier to share pictures while on the go.","Expert reviewers were impressed by the Sony DVP-FX820. The large 8 inch LCD screen was bright and very easy to see, even in bright light. It comes with a remote control and even a car charger for the longer trips. The 6 hour battery does in fact last 6 hours. The unit was a little heavy at 2.7 pounds and if it came with a USB port or memory card slot this unit would be even better.","Users were drawn to the DVP-FX820 for its screen size and 800 x 480 resolution. The images on the screen were bright and clear. Some even remarked that it looked better than their 50 inch high definition TV. The choice of different colors makes this unit even more attractive and gives it some style."]},"id":"cf8b34a7-63ef-4b9c-b830-67454121a66d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"564c689d-25c6-4b53-ac91-70f8d4abd66d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When it comes to your portable DVD player don’t mess around.
