The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-portable-air-conditioners\">Portable Air Conditioners</a> here.</em>","If you&#39;re looking for a portable air conditioner that&#39;s a powerful dehumidifier as well, consider an American Comfort portable AC. American Comfort’s model ACW500C is rated to cool rooms of up to 400 square feet, and it also pulls up to 66 pints of moisture a day from the air, providing relief on the muggiest of days.","The ACW500C is one of the largest portable AC units on the market, with 13,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) of power. It&#39;s great for a big room, although in a smaller room, it will use more energy than it needs to for cooling the space. Energy consumption is one reason you should size your mobile air conditioner for the room it&#39;s cooling.","One of the best features of this American Comfort portable air conditioner is its dehumidifying power and auto-drain technology. Rather than draining whatever moisture it does not use in the cooling process into a drip pan, the unit turns the water into an ultra-fine mist that it releases through the exhaust. This requires installing a spiral water pipe into the exhaust hose, both of which are included with the unit. The instruction manual has instructions with photo illustrations. In the case that your humidity is beyond its auto-drain capability, there is a catch pan and a full water indicator light. The catch pan drains from the back of the unit.","At 67 pounds, this mobile air conditioner is lighter than others in its power class, and it has castors and handles to make it easy to move from room to room. It comes with a window kit that allows you to vent outside, which is a must if you are dehumidifying as well. It&#39;s taller than a lot of portable AC units (just under 35 inches), but at about 16 inches wide by 17 inches deep, it&#39;s not as wide as many.","The 10.57 energy efficiency rating is very nice, and it has temperature controls, three fan speeds and a sleep option to help conserve energy. When in sleep mode, the unit will gradually raise the temperature of the room by a few degrees. This saves energy when the room does not need to be kept as cool, such as when you&#39;re asleep or out of the room for extended periods of time.","You can program it to cool for a certain number of hours in addition to setting a temperature. It does come with a remote, and the control panel has an LED screen, making it easy to program.","Like all portable air conditioner units, it does make noise. It&#39;s rated at under 56 dBAs, or about the same as your dishwasher.  This is the on the high end of normal for a portable air conditioning unit.","The filters are washable and designed to remove odors from the room. You access them easily from the back of the unit. Should you need replacement filters, you can get them from American Comfort’s online store.","American Comfort offers a 30-day risk-free trial; if you don&#39;t like the product, send it back for a complete refund. The American Comfort portable AC unit comes with a one-year limited warranty. The user manual is available on the website. Customer service is open on weekdays, or you can reach representatives via e-mail. There is also a FAQs page where you can find answers to the most common questions or concerns.","The American Comfort ACW500C is a 13,000 BTU portable air conditioner with a lot of dehumidifying power. Its auto-drain technology means less work and less mess draining the unit, and the 30-day money-back guarantee is a nice offer. American Comfort offers several other portable ACs with power ranging from 1,000 BTUs to 14,000 BTUs."]},"id":"c361e2b6-08c6-4fd0-87d2-4527d394d90b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58324","url":"/american-comfort-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-04T23:14:06Z","datePublished":"2013-12-04T23:14:06Z","name":"American Comfort ACW500C","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
