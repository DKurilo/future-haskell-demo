The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-video-converter-software\"><em>Video Converter Software here</em></a><em>.</em>","Digital Media Converter from DeskShare is a decent video converter software contender. The list of file types it can import and export is good, but the best entrants still show more potential, with even longer lists that include the formats we looked for. You only want to buy video conversion software once, so it makes sense to get the application with the most compatible conversion formats. Digital Media Converter is not that product.","However, the software can tackle these formats: 3GP, 3G2, ASF, AVI, DV-AVI, DVR-MS, Flash Video (FLV), MOV (QuickTime), MP4, MPEG 1, MPEG 2, DAT, MPEG, OGM, VOB and WMV on the video side. On the audio side of things, it will read AIFF, AMR, AU, Audio CD, DVF, M4A, MP3, MSV, OGG, RA, SND, WAV and WMA.","Video output types include 3GP, AVI (including DivX and MPEG-4), DV-AVI (Digital Video AVI for PAL and NTSC standards), Flash Video (FLV), MP4 (including Sony PSP and Apple iPod), MPEG-1, MPEG-2 Formats (DVD in both PAL and NTSC standards), MOV (QuickTime) and WMV (Windows Media Video). Audio outputs are AMR, M4A, MP3, Ogg Vorbis (OGG), WAV and WMA (Windows Media Audio).","That&#39;s a good list, but we found that the software will not support RealMedia or Flash videos downloaded from the internet. Additionally, Digital Media Converter does not have the ability to rip VOB files directly to a DVD.","You can adjust various aspects of your output files, including video dimensions, and video and audio codices, and include some minor effects such as inverted colors, gray scale and mirror image.","The application has a number of different additional features, such as the ability to make DVD-format files and to save the extracted soundtrack from a video as an MP3. All videos you convert with Digital Media Converter can be transformed into streaming video that can play on a website.","A simple three-step process makes Digital Media Converter accessible to anyone. First, you have to select the files to convert. Next, you must choose the format you want them converted to. Finally, you just have to click one button to start the conversion.","Digital Media Converter includes a built-in help guide, online tutorials, a FAQs section and a user forum. Additionally, staff members answered our emails in about a day. Live help options such as telephone or chat are missing."]},"id":"090cacd4-5ef9-41ea-834f-52fdd9de2056","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a1085cf8-3ae5-42c1-9524-c0d49c218629","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, we are impressed with Digital Media Converter because of its solid list of compatible file formats.
