As such, you should not take our recommendations unless the concentrator is capable of meeting the prescription criteria laid out by your doctor.","We cannot stress this enough – listen to your doctor. Since oxygen therapy is a prescription, you need to follow the directions as set out by your doctor. We need oxygen to live, but too much can damage your lungs. Your doctor has to prescribe how often you need oxygen therapy, whether you need it at night, the proper flow rate and how long you need it each day. This is why these devices require a prescription.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","Most of the critical characteristics you should look for in a concentrator, such as the oxygen percentage and output, depend entirely on your physician&#39;s prescription. In other words, a concentrator that has a 5-liter-per-minute output at 96-percent oxygen purity isn&#39;t necessarily the best one for your needs. In fact, it could be the worst device for you. It all depends on your physical needs, as determined by your doctor.","Here are some other tips and recommendations to consider:","<strong>What’s the Difference between an Oxygen Tanks and a Concentrator?</strong><br/>When most people think of oxygen therapy, they picture the metal tanks that must be either carried or carted around. These tanks are like smaller versions of a scuba tank, and they are filled with compressed oxygen that you breathe through a cannula – the tube that delivers the oxygen to the nose. Concentrators also use a cannula, but they are smaller and pull oxygen from the atmosphere.","Since concentrators don&#39;t require routine refilling of a tank, many people view them as the better option. Indeed, concentrators are usually smaller and more portable. Also, the cost of refilling an oxygen tank adds up over time, which means concentrators are better for long-term therapy.","On the other hand, concentrators cost more upfront than oxygen tanks. And while the cost is often covered by insurance, it may not be if your prescription is for short-term therapy. In addition, oxygen tanks don&#39;t require power to operate, so they last much longer and are more reliable in places where you may not have access to a power outlet to recharge a battery, such as on a road trip. Either way, you should use the oxygen therapy prescribed by your physician.","<strong>Oxygen Flow Options</strong><br/>Regardless of whether you end up with a tank or a concentrator, your doctor determines whether you need a continuous or pulse flow setup. As the name states, continuous flow is always pumping oxygen to you, no matter your breathing rate.","Alternatively, pulse flow only provides oxygen when you inhale. While this method conserves oxygen, it is generally not recommended for those who need to use oxygen while sleeping, as some people may not breathe hard enough to trigger the necessary pulse. Many concentrators use one method or the other, but some offer both.","Your doctor will also determine your oxygen flow rate. Most users only need rates of about 2 to 4 liters per minute (LPM) of oxygen. Those that require more will likely need to use a face mask.","<strong>Travelling With Oxygen</strong><br/>If you fly with your oxygen, you need a device that is FAA approved because it must be able to work under pressurized conditions. Additionally, it&#39;s important to note that most airlines require oxygen users to have enough battery life (for concentrators) or air capacity (for tanks) to last one and a half to two times the length of the flight.","<strong>What is a Portable Oxygen Concentrator Used For?</strong><br/>A portable oxygen concentrator is a mobile version of the technology that supplies filtered oxygen drawn in from the surrounding air. Other gases, including nitrogen, are filtered out, and pure oxygen flows directly to the user.","These mobile concentrators do the same thing as home models but run on a lithium-ion battery. Battery life varies by model, but carrying multiple batteries extends how long you can use the concentrator when you are out and about.","<strong>What are the Different Types of Oxygen Concentrators?</strong><br/>Modern oxygen concentrators can be divided into two types: mobile and home. The mobile versions are portable, come in a variety of sizes and have varying battery length. You can buy accessories like extra batteries and carrying packs to suit the needs of your or your loved one’s lifestyle.","Home oxygen concentrators are larger and typically used by people who are more homebound. It’s worth noting there’s a big price difference between home and portable oxygen concentrators, with portables being more expensive overall. The cost of miniaturizing the technology as well as the price of batteries makes portable versions more expensive.","<strong>Are Oxygen Concentrators Covered By Medicare?</strong><br/>This is a tricky question. <a href=\"https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/oxygen-equipment-and-accessories.html\">Medicare</a> defines an oxygen concentrator, or any medical device used for respiratory therapy, as an equipment rental. A medical equipment company rents you an oxygen concentrator and then bills Medicare a fee every month.","Where things get complicated is that oxygen equipment is limited to a 36-month rental period. Due to reimbursement guidelines, suppliers who bill Medicare are cautious about what types of equipment they rent out. ","If you qualify for coverage, Medicare is required to cover you for 60 months total. However, as mentioned, oxygen equipment is limited to only 36 months of coverage. That means once your 36 months are up, the amount Medicare pays out declines sharply. For the remaining 24 months, Medicare only covers a servicing fee (<a href=\"https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-09-04-00420.pdf\">one report</a> suggests it’s around $21 a month) for the equipment you already have. ","This also means that if you’re already into your 36 months of coverage and want to switch devices, you will likely be rejected because the cost of providing you with new equipment will be more than the medical device company can make by billing Medicare.","To make things even more complicated, Medicare has something called national competitive bidding. This means the companies with the best bids receive contracts to provide medical devices to an assigned region of the country. This has driven down reimbursements even more. Further, Medicare only provides a flat rate payment for oxygen equipment, no matter what device you use.","<strong>How Long Do Oxygen Concentrators Last?</strong><br/>Unfortunately, portable oxygen concentrators do not last very long. When oxygen purity drops below 80 percent, it’s advised you get a replacement unit, and that can happen between <a href=\"https://www.oxygenconcentratorstore.com/blog/life-expectancy-of-a-portable-oxygen-concentrator/\">800 and 1,500 hours</a>. The concentrator uses zeolite crystals to filter out nitrogen, and these minerals typically last for 10 years. However, with constant use, the mechanical parts experience natural wear and tear.","<strong>Do Oxygen Concentrators Use Liquid Oxygen?</strong> <br/>No, oxygen concentrators pull oxygen from the open air and then process and filter it.","<strong>How much do oxygen concentrators cost?</strong><br/>Prices vary, with home concentrators typically costing less than mobile ones. Some portable oxygen concentrators cost as much as $4,000, and home models start in the $800 range. A general rule of thumb is the more you spend, the better the concentrator.","<strong>Do I Need to See a Doctor Before Getting an Oxygen Concentrator?</strong><br/>Yes, you need to see a doctor and be prescribed a device for respiratory therapy before you can buy one.","<strong>Can I Buy a Used Portable Oxygen Concentrator?</strong><br/>Yes, buying pre-owned or refurbished oxygen concentrators is an option. Several retailers offer refurbished or pre-owned units. ","<strong>Will Insurance Cover a Portable Oxygen Concentrator?</strong><br/>Yes, private insurers cover medical devices for oxygen therapy, including portable oxygen concentrators."]},"id":"43253f4c-2b9e-4cfb-8b08-e689393d4129","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"666b4d7f-0147-4273-b4f5-d200d0373406","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.inogen.com/products/g4-systems/\">Inogen</a>","<a href=\"http://www.cairemedical.com/caire-focus/\">Caire Medical</a>","<a href=\"http://www.oxygenconcentratorstore.com/igo/\">DeVilbiss</a>","<a href=\"http://www.inovalabs.com/products/product/activox-4l/\">Inova Labs</a>","<a href=\"http://www.invacare.com/cgi-bin/imhqprd/inv_catalog/prod_cat_detail.jsp?s=0&prodID=XPO100&catOID=-536890257\">Invacare</a>","<a href=\"http://www.cascadehealthcaresolutions.com/nuvo-lite-oxygen-concentrator-p/ndklite3.htm\">Nidek</a>","<a href=\"https://www.directhomemedical.com/cart/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=oxlife-independence-portable-oxygen-concentrator&Store_Code=DHM&gclid=CjwKCAjwg_fZBRAoEiwAppvp-YrTTJbF2i5cTaSxRKYWZ2Ma9LkiqL6PrgJActMbkEZPdTNip79v-hoCU5sQAvD_BwE\">O2 Concepts</a>","<a href=\"https://www.cascadehealthcaresolutions.com/oxus-portable-oxygen-concentrator-p/RS-00410.htm\">Oxus</a>","<a href=\"http://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/product/HCNOCTN350/simplygo-mini-portable-oxygen-system-concentrator\">Philips</a>","<a href=\"https://www.4mdmedical.com/catalog/product/view/id/269841/\">Precision Medical</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"c031f844-8790-427d-ba73-e1578ba0c5d9","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1848","url":"/best-portable-oxygen-concentrators","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alexander-eriksen","url":"/author/alexander-eriksen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Alexander Eriksen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"hwemruvZsTXWMqRixKJ49","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-10-21T11:49:48Z","datePublished":"2016-12-13T21:37:58Z","name":"Best Portable Oxygen Concentrators of 2019","synopsis":"Oxygen concentrators are more portable than traditional oxygen tanks.
