It makes some sense: mobile devices generally need slimmed down versions so that they run more smoothly on such small systems. If you only have a tablet, though, you won’t be able to create professional looking documents with such basic apps. <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=softmaker.applications.textmaker.hd&amp;hl=en\">Office HD: TextMaker Full</a> solves this problem.","<strong>Word Processing Features<br/></strong>TextMaker Full, also called TextMaker HD, has a wide range of features that mirror full word processing software. You can insert fields, footers, headers, tables, photos, text art, bulleted lists, charts and much more. You can also use the drawing tool to add your own custom art.","<strong>Editing Tools <br/></strong>Often word processing apps skimp on the editing tools, but TextMaker Full is a different story. It can spell check in 17 languages, add automatic hyphenation to words in 33 languages and look up synonyms for words in 10 languages. When it finds an error, the mistake is underlined in red.","<strong>Saving and Sharing<br/></strong>Once you have your document completed, you’ll want to save and share it. TextMaker HD is compatible with many different file types. You can open and save DOC, DOCX, OpenDocument, RTF, HTML, PDF and other file types using this app. You can also save and share your documents using Google Drive, Amazon Cloud Drive, Dropbox, Evernote and OneDrive.","If you’re collaborating, the app has you covered. You can track changes made to the document and add comments.","<strong>What it Lacks<br/></strong>The major drawback to this app is that it is intended for tablets, not phones. If you download it to your phone you may have problems using the whole workspace. If you are a phone user, we suggest using <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-microsoft-office-alternatives\">Google Docs</a> as your go-to Android word processing app. It has nearly all of the same features as TextMaker HD, but works well on your phone.","While Office HD: TextMaker Full is loaded with useful features, it isn’t designed for use on a phone. For tablet users, though, this is one of the best Android apps you can download for your word processing needs."]},"id":"c9c12f54-2dd4-4b7c-8f82-d63203ed51ca","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10013","url":"/best-word-processing-app-for-android","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alina-bradford","url":"/author/alina-bradford","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Alina Bradford","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"B3tPrF8sxRUy8i2s9RVdDe","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-02T15:36:26Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T15:36:26Z","name":"Best Word Processing App for Android","synopsis":"Many word processing apps for Android are overly basic, offering none of the features that most word processing software typically provides.","review":{},"strapline":"Many word processing apps for Android are overly basic, offering none of the features that most word processing software typically provides.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-08-02T20:35:51Z","id":"SjaohFSTDz9GdV7cts8dsX","meta":{"title":"Best Word Processing App for Android","description":"Office HD: TextMaker Full is one of the best word processing apps for Android devices.
