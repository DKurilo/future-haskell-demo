It also has some excellent safety and convenience features. However, while this infant car seat looks great on paper, the real-world usage is a hassle. The Mesa is heavier than nearly any other car seat we reviewed. Also, its canopy stains in the rain, a serious design flaw for a product meant to protect your child from the weather. This is one of the most beautiful car seats available, but it is not practical for most families.","Like all retail car seats, the UPPAbaby Mesa meets federal crash testing requirements. This rear-facing car seat offers extra support around your infant&#39;s head for protection against side impacts. It will support newborns as light as 4 pounds with an infant cushion insert, and as your baby grows, the seat secures children as large as 35 pounds or 32 inches. In other words, you&#39;ll be able to use this baby until she is 15 to 21 months old, according to average growth rates.","On paper, the Mesa has some excellent convenience features. It is compatible with both the Vista and Cruz strollers, and its stay-in-car base has a finished bottom to protect your car&#39;s seats. If you want a car seat with more compatible stroller options, you might want to consider the <a href=\"/peg-perego-primo-viaggio-review\">Peg Perego Primo Viaggio</a>. The adjustable carry handle has a one-button release to detach from strollers. Also, the cushions are machine washable. However, at over 11 pounds, this is one of the heaviest car seats we reviewed. Also, the attractive canopy becomes stained in the rain, a major issue since canopies are meant to handle the weather. While this will not expose your baby to the elements in any way, it is an aesthetic problem.Â ","Mesa&#39;s base comes with LATCH connectors for simple installation, and the level indicator makes it easy to find the correct recline. If you&#39;re using a seat belt, the installation process is more difficult, and there are extra loops and locks for installing the seat without a base. UPPAbaby offers a two-year warranty on the Mesa, and the company website offers downloadable user manuals and a local retailer locator. Customer support agents are quick to answer questions and available by email, phone and live chat."]},"id":"b5fd773e-ea55-403f-89de-0dfeefdcb029","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"460659d0-fccd-4655-885d-e49e809765b7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The UPPAbaby Mesa is a high-end baby car seat with some excellent safety features, but it is too heavy and comes equipped with a poorly designed weather canopy.
