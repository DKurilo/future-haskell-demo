You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Full sized cooktops typically hold four to six burners, large enough to fit the cookware for a full meal. Two-burner models like the Summit CR2110 deliver equal amounts of power relative to its size, so you can cook your food while taking up a third of the space of typical stoves and cooktops. Cooktops with a smooth surface, like this one, also serve as counter space when not in use. A small cooktop gives you extra burners, but doesn’t rob you of counter space so you can keep your range or current cooktop as well.","For such a small cooktop, the Summit CR2110 delivers a powerful but energy efficient 2,400 watts to its dual 6-inch burners. It&#39;s a great addition if you prefer boiling water for coffee or tea without taking up space on your larger range or cooktop.","This ceramic cooktop is made of eco-friendly lead-free EuroKera brand glass that uses high infrared transmission and radiant energy to heat food quickly. The 12-inch ceramic glass is smooth, black and easy to clean, but you have to do it frequently to maintain the shine. The glass ceramic surface is prone to holding stains and requires cleaners made specifically for flat <a href=\"/best-electric-cooktops\">electric cooktops</a>. Its surface is durable, but still vulnerable, so avoid cookware made of copper, cast iron, glass or earthenware, as they will scratch the surface of the glass cooktop. Instead, you should use stainless steel cookware with smooth flat bottoms to keep the cooktop surface free from scratches."]},"id":"dac8af38-852b-4618-b06c-de25895e0d34","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/zpxF4UgGdJN6XarcPPr4YY.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57653-summit-cr21104.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zpxF4UgGdJN6XarcPPr4YY.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"zpxF4UgGdJN6XarcPPr4YY","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zpxF4UgGdJN6XarcPPr4YY.jpg","alt":""},"id":"4c2ce118-6c58-4906-9928-2aadf87e6249","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The heat controls on the Summit CR2110 have a push-to-turn design, so any change in temperature is intentional.
