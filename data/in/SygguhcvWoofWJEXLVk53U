You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Pioneer SP-PK22BS is big in both size and sound. Each component within the <a href=\"/best-home-theater-in-a-box-systems\">home theater speaker</a> system is large, but the additional room for larger drivers pays dividends in sound quality. The Pioneer home theater speakers sound full, clear and powerful.","We tested each set of speakers by watching a scene from an action film to compare the speakers in three phases – bass response, dialogue clarity and surround sound. Our panelists listened critically and ranked each home theater speaker system based on these criteria.","Our panelists found the subwoofer to be in balance with the rest of the speaker system – not overpowering, but enough to add depth to the sound scape. The bass was punchy with good attack. You could really feel the presence of the bass when it first hits.","The surround sound unity was the most impressive part of this surround sound speaker system&#39;s performance. The four bookshelf speakers, combined with the center speaker, fully engaged our listening panel while sound was coming from all angles within the room. There is one scene in particular in the movie where the main character is surround by motorcyclists. During this part, our listening panel described the feeling just like the main character. You could hear the rumbling of the engines all around you, swallowing you in the low growl of the motorcycles. Only the top home theater speakers received A grades in this department – the Pioneer home theater speaker system being one of a few to do so.","Our panel felt the dialogue clarity was one of the only issues in the overall sound quality. The large drivers are able to reach low frequencies and produce deeper bass tones than most satellite speakers we reviewed. The overall warmth and full tonal quality of the speakers didn&#39;t allow the dialogue to cut through like other systems we compared. One of our reviewers felt that the dialogue had a slight echo, making it sound like it was coming from a hall. While the overall sound quality of these speakers was impressive, the dialogue clarity wasn&#39;t a strong point.","The first thing you&#39;ll notice when you look at this speaker system is the size. These speakers are large, especially in comparison to other 5.1 surround sound speakers. The speakers measure 8.5 x 7.2 x 12.6 inches (LxWxH). The average speakers in our lineup are roughly 5 x 5 x 5 inches. These large speakers are not wall mountable, while all others in our comparison can be mounted to the wall.","The satellite speakers&#39; large cabinet enables them to have large drivers, and in turn, a wide frequency response range. Each bookshelf speaker features a 4-inch driver and a 1-inch tweeter inside of the enclosure. Larger speakers generally have a more dynamic frequency response than smaller drivers, which is the case here. The Pioneer speaker system has a 55Hz-20kHz frequency range, which is among the best in our comparison.","The subwoofer specifications are equally as impressive as the satellite speakers. The subwoofer can reach down to a deep 38Hz, making it one of the lowest-reaching subs that we reviewed.  This helps drive low-pounding bass frequencies and makes those low booming explosions in movies sound powerful.","The built-in amplifier only boasts 100 watts of peak power. That makes this one of the least powerful subwoofers in our review, although our panelists liked the balance between bass and treble in our listening tests.","The center speaker looks like something from the 1990s. It is huge in comparison to all of the other center speakers in our review. It measures 8.6 x 18.2 x 7.2 inches (LxWxH). This can become an issue if you have your TV on a stand and want to rest the center speaker directly in front of the TV. The speaker is so tall that it blocks the remote control receiver on many televisions. The upside is the center speaker features the same large drivers as the bookshelf speakers, but the size is a bit obnoxious.","Pioneer offers the shortest warranty in our lineup. While other companies offer up to five years of coverage, Pioneer only offers a one-year warranty. Pioneer also offers telephone and email support, but expect a few days for a response via email."]},"id":"d5f1dcab-2075-41ae-b4f6-55613414ca69","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e30381c1-a922-4434-9aeb-d5fd0e2e482a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This home theater system is impressive.
