It will meet most of the needs of experienced editors and producers, but key omissions of some basic and advanced functionality make it a middling program.","This movie making software features the familiar timeline workflow. Users who know their way around the timeline format should grasp the essentials of the software with few problems. You have access to unlimited audio/video editing tracks for complex projects, which will more than satisfy the needs of veteran editors.","The program also features an interactive storyboard module that makes it easier to complete quick projects and learn the basics. A storyboard mode has been missing from previous versions of this software, so its inclusion greatly enhances the program’s usefulness.","The program also offers guided video edits. This mode walks you through the video creation process step-by-step. In this simplified process, you pick the media you want to use and the program places them on the timeline for you. Then it has you pick other elements like transitions, titles and audio. When you’ve reached the end, it allows you to export your project as a standalone file or upload it to the internet. This is an outstanding tool because it reduces the video making process into just a few minutes.","VEGAS has a healthy library of titles, transitions and effects to choose from. Most editors will be satisfied with the toolset that includes advanced features like the chroma key (green screen), video stabilizer, audio mixer, masking tools, 3D editing and more. Some of these tools are easy to find, but others are buried deep within the interface and even knowledgeable editors may have to consult the help section or tutorials to find what they’re looking for. But once learned, these tools are useful and powerful and will be invaluable tools that enable editors to craft both simple and complex videos.","One feature worthy of note is multi-cam mode. This tool can import and synchronize video footage of an event taken from multiple sources. For example, video of a concert, sports game or other event captured on multiple smartphones can be synced and edited into a single video. This could previously be accomplished manually, but it is extremely difficult and time consuming, even for veteran editors. The multi-cam mode removes all the guesswork and switches between angles quickly and easily.","This has several basic tools such as picture-in-picture editing tracks and improved workflow tools such as a quickstart dashboard and simplified media import tools. They’ve also added more advanced tools, such as motion tracking capabilities. This isolates moving objects and people within a video and applies effects to them as the video progresses. Recent additions also include the ability to manipulate 360-degree video.","When you’re finished crafting your video project with VEGAS Movie Studio, you’ll find the exporting process rather easy to manage. Advanced users will appreciate the customizable render templates that allow them to fine-tune how they want their videos to be exported.","VEGAS Movie Studio Platinum is both useful and powerful video editing software. It has enough tools to fulfill the needs of many video editors."]},"id":"d3b51335-617c-4d2a-98d5-8355bee4c75f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69198","url":"/vegas-movie-studio-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
