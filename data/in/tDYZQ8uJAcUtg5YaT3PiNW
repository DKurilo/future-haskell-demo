Internally, the player touts a standard slate of features like deep color and 24p support. As with most non-premium Blu-ray players, the iVid lacks 4K support.","The player&#39;s straightforward software setup proved beneficial during our boot test, in which we timed how long it took a player to reach its menu screen after being turned on. The iVid&#39;s mark of 3.1 seconds was among the best we saw for comparable <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-players\">3D Blu-ray players</a>. In hands-on testing, we had no issues with 3D playback on the player. Samples of &#34;Gravity&#34; on an active 3D HDTV played with strong visual fidelity.","Elsewhere, the player supports home audio standards like Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. Notably, the player includes support for both optical and coaxial output, along with component cable jacks. Depending on how old your home theater equipment is, this versatility can be useful for setting up dedicated speaker systems.","Externally, this 3D Blu-ray player has a mixed combination of strengths and weaknesses. The player physically falls in line with comparable models, with dimensions of 16.9 x 7.9 x 1.6 inches and a weight of 3.5 pounds. As such, the iVid takes up minimal space in your home entertainment unit.","However, the player is limited by two notable issues: The iVid lacks Wi-Fi support and applications for video streaming services like Netflix or Hulu. Both are standard inclusions for home theater equipment and are commonly found on hardware like HDTVs and audio receivers. For internet access, the iVid relies on an Ethernet jack on its backside. These omissions significantly limit the iVid&#39;s versatility, though the player makes up for it in other areas. Its support for region-free playback makes it valuable if you frequently watch overseas or foreign movies in your home theater.","While Blu-ray players aren&#39;t the most technical home theater devices, iVid offers minimal support options for the BD780. Outside of phone support and a basic troubleshooting section in the manual, there&#39;s little in the way of substantive coverage for the Blu-ray player."]},"id":"0da544db-574c-4715-ad00-d19b08ff76cb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"952085bc-8076-41c8-8dbb-f0fdfef196ad","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For better or worse, the iVid BD780 covers the basics for a home theater setup.
