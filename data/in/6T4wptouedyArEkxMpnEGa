Suze Orman is an internationally acclaimed personal financial expert. She has appeared on several television shows and has given many talks about how to handle your finances.  Now she has teamed up with her attorney, and together they have created an easy-to-use application for creating your own will. This step-by-step application walks you through the entire process of creating all of the necessary documents for your last will and testament. This includes creating items such as a power of attorney, statement of last wishes, schedule of assets and more.  This will-making software is the Top Ten Reviews Silver Award winner."]},"id":"2a1badfe-c1e7-4588-a87d-cce2c332985b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Document Creation Tools"},"id":"80b7175c-6184-425e-b0b5-305b7c2c0aff","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This will-maker software comes ready to help you create any and all of the documents you need for the final stages of your life. The format of Suze Orman Will &amp; Trust Kit is easy to follow and easy to understand. You simply fill in the document by answering Suze’s questions, and to make it legal (in all states except Louisiana), simply print out your documents and have them notarized. We liked the fact that Suze Orman is actually talking to you while you are creating your documents. She gives you the instructions in her voice and also lists them on the side of the screen if you’d like to follow along. We found this to be helpful for those who learn better when they have the chance to both listen and read the information.","With the Suze Orman Will &amp; Trust Kit, you have the opportunity to create documents such as an advance health care directive – an important document for you to have if you have chosen not to allow drastic measures to save your life when you have experienced a serious accident or health condition. This document will allow your survivors to honor your wishes without having to be concerned with their own feelings during such an emotional time. This will not only give you peace of mind, but will also give your survivors peace of mind knowing their final gift to you was honoring your wishes.","Another important document that you should create when making out your last will and testament is a listing of all of your assets. This should include all account numbers, telephone numbers and other necessary information. This will help your survivors  handle the business end of your passing with as much ease as possible.","Having your funeral planned out can ease the burden on loved ones when you have passed away. If you have pre-planned your funeral, it is important that you keep these documents together with your will. This will take a lot of the guesswork out of planning a funeral when your survivors are already feeling the shock and pain of losing their loved one. This will-making software offers you templates for these documents and allows you to keep them all together in one simple application.","If you decide to revise your existing will, you will need to first generate a revocation document. This is a legal document that states that your previous will should be null and void if anything is to happen to you. Once you have those documents signed and notarized, be sure to keep them in a safe place. It’s also a good idea to have a second copy of the revocation documents and have a trusted person keep them for you. This could prevent someone from trying to contest your new will when the opportunity comes.","For those that may be concerned about keeping their end of life wishes private, this application can be password protected. When your first set up the application, you will be asked if you’d like to create a password. You will also have to answer a few security questions, so in the event that you lose your original password, you can still access your will documents."]},"id":"09181e81-2d98-43a6-b547-30bac84ab02c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Documents Created"},"id":"1230d428-7d9f-4a69-86b9-59fa5b2a3521","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Because the Suze Orman Will &amp; Trust Kit is based on answering questions about yourself, your assets and your heirs, we found this application to be very easy to use.
