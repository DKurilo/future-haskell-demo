Since it is battery-powered, you do not need to worry about fuel emissions from it damaging the environment, and it operates at a quieter level than gas-powered hedge trimmers.","This trimmer&#39;s 40-volt rechargeable lithium-ion battery has a long running time that allows you to get plenty of yardwork done. It can handle as much as 6,000 square feet of hedge trimming on one battery charge. It has an indicator panel so you can see how much battery power you have at any point with the push of a button. In addition, the charger that comes with the trimmer displays a flashing light while the battery is charging so you can tell the battery&#39;s status during that process.","When you first get the trimmer out of the box, it takes eight hours to charge for the first use. After that, an hour of charging should bring it to full capacity. The fully charged battery can run for approximately 45 minutes, which is sufficient time to trim the vegetation in average-sized yards.","The 24-inch dual-action blades can slice through branches measuring up to 0.7500 inches and produce 2,400 cutting strokes per minute, which is enough to cut through tough and dense stems without difficulty. The LHT2436 provides clean, precise trims.","For a cordless hedge trimmer, the LHT2436&#39;s power level compares nicely with the robust capabilities of electric hedge trimmers. The dual-action capability reduces the vibration as you work, which means you experience less muscle fatigue.","Weighing in at 6.9 pounds, this cordless hedge trimmer is relatively light, so you can easily trim hedges, shrubs and other vegetation without overexertion. You also do not have to contend with maneuvering an electrical cord around the yard as you work.","The wrap-around front handle gives you a solid and comfortable grip whether you are holding it vertically or horizontally to groom the sides or tops of hedges. However, the handle is fixed so you cannot rotate it. Rotation would afford you an even greater level of comfort while you work.","The Black &amp; Decker LHT2436 is fast and strong for a cordless hedge trimmer, able to handle tough vegetation with reasonable ease. Its comfortable weight and clean-slicing blades add to this convenience."]},"id":"f7689435-b0c3-4170-971d-6ed03d0a4066","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62927","url":"/black-decker-cordless-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-20T18:41:51Z","datePublished":"2015-02-20T18:41:51Z","name":"Black & Decker Cordless LHT2436","synopsis":"The Black & Decker LHT2436 is a popular cordless hedge trimmer that can take on a large volume of trimming tasks per battery charge and can handle tougher vegetation than many other cordless model","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Black & Decker LHT2436 is a popular cordless hedge trimmer that can take on a large volume of trimming tasks per battery charge and can handle tougher vegetation than many other cordless model","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-20T18:41:51Z","id":"UtgmiEnULfJzwVC8nv38t6","meta":{"title":"Black & Decker Cordless LHT2436 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Black &amp; Decker LHT2436 is a cordless hedge trimmer with dual-action blades.
