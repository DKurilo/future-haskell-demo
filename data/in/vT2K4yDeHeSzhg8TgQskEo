This essentially covers 700MHz to 2100MHz, which means that it has a much broader reach than most cell phone boosters, giving you the best opportunity of a reliable signal on many different types of phones and cell providers.

It uses a magnet, so you don&#39;t have to worry about drilling holes or damaging your paint job. If you don&#39;t have a metal roof, you&#39;ll have to install it on the trunk.
