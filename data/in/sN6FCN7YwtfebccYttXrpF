You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With the combination of industry-leading airflow mechanics and materials, this unit makes for a great addition to any family looking to make their own natural snacks or for those who hunt.","The Excalibur <a href=\"/best-dehydrators\">Food and Fruit Dehydrator</a> takes dehydrating your favorite snacks to another level. The stainless steel exterior makes it a stylish addition to any kitchen. The armored glass doors make it easy to look into the unit and view 10 large stainless steel trays measuring 15  x 15 inches each. If you need something more compact for your kitchen countertop, check out the <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-dehydrators/nesco-review\">Nesco Snackmaster Pro</a>.","The unit features Excalibur’s patented Parallex Horizontal Air Flow and Hyperwave Fluctuation Technology, which are the most efficient heat and dry combination on the market. The 6.5-inch fan has a quiet motor, so making your favorite snacks isn&#39;t a noisy process.","It has an option for two times and two temperatures so you can set the temperature to a specific amount of time at the beginning of the dehydrating process. At the end of the process, the second setting can be changed to a lower temperature while the drying is finishing.","What sets this dehydrator apart from others is its 99-hour timer. Instead of repeatedly checking on your food during the drying process, you can set the timer and come back when the food is dry. The unit automatically turns off when the set time is complete and the food is dry. All settings and the display on the Excalibur Food and Fruit Dehydrator are digital, making the unit easy to use.","When you&#39;re using the thermostat, the unit turns on automatically. The adjustable thermostat allows you to dry food between 95 degrees and 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperature control helps preserve the nutrients and meets safety standards when drying things such as beef jerky and other meats.","The Excalibur Food and Fruit Dehydrator adds a touch of style to any kitchen with its stainless steel trays. Its one-of-kind airflow and quiet motor make it a good choice for anyone looking to start dehydrating food."]},"id":"0d22ef0d-2382-459c-9654-997ebb697f9b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61113","url":"/excalibur-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-11T17:51:21Z","datePublished":"2014-11-11T17:51:21Z","name":"Excalibur 10-Tray Dehydrator","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-11-11T17:51:21Z","id":"sN6FCN7YwtfebccYttXrpF","meta":{"title":"Excalibur 10-Tray Dehydrator Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Excalibur 10-Tray Dehydrator is a stylish stainless steel.
