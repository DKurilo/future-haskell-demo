Here’s more on choosing a system to meet your needs, along with detail on how we arrived at our ranking of online POS systems.</em>","Most modern point-of-sale (POS) systems are all, at least partially, online. At a minimum, you&#39;ll need an internet or traditional phone line to process debit and credit card payments. Online POS systems are always up-to-date, affordable and cross-platform compatible. Cross-platform compatible simply means that the web-based POS system can be used with a variety of devices such as PCs, iPads or Android tablets. Since the software runs online, it is flexible in terms of compatible hardware. But you&#39;ll want to verify with the POS provider first whether the online POS software you&#39;re thinking of is truly compatible with the device you plan to use.","If you&#39;re considering making the switch to an online POS system, keep reading to learn about the advantages of switching, the lowest-cost options out there, and what we uncovered during our evaluation of online POS systems. To learn more about point-of-sale solutions in general, see our <a href=\"/money\">articles about POS systems</a>.","<strong>Advantages of Online POS Systems</strong>","Since most systems are at least partially online these days, online POS options are well worth exploring. If you are looking for an iPad solution, read our <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/business/payment-processing/best-credit-card-processing/\">iPad POS</a> or <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/business/payment-processing/best-credit-card-processing/\">iPad Restaurant</a> reviews.","Here are a few advantages to online POS systems:","<strong>Always Available</strong><br/>Online POS dashboards can be accessed from anywhere using your login. You can check the status of your store or restaurant while you are at home, running errands, or any time you are away from your business. It also makes hardware changes simple since you can easily upgrade your PC or iPad without the complication of reloading software and transferring data files. The service manages your data backup online.","<strong>Always Up to Date</strong><br/>Unlike traditional software, online versions are current. You receive frequent updates as part of your subscription. This also allows the POS company to roll out updates or issue patches that fix known issues or adapt to new technologies.","<strong>Mobile and 4G Options</strong><br/>One of the benefits of an online POS system is that you can log in from a browser and access it anywhere there&#39;s a mobile or Wi-Fi connection. In most cases, you&#39;ll need to install a mobile app to process sales or access the manager&#39;s dashboard. Some apps also give owners or managers access to real-time reports so they can check and instantly see how their store or restaurant is doing.","<strong>Lowest-Cost Online POS Starter Options</strong>","Online POS solutions are much more affordable than traditional systems. In the past, the upfront cost for one terminal easily could run as high as $3,000 plus monthly fees; nowadays, the costs are much lower. There are minimal upfront costs with Square and PayPal, but each system requires that you buy and use their card reader and sign up for their processing service in order to use their POS system. Shopify starts as low as $10 per month. Most of these systems are compatible with multiple devices, so you may be able to continue using the same equipment you already own. If you don&#39;t process a lot of transactions and you&#39;re looking for a basic setup, you could run your sales using a PC and print receipts using a traditional computer printer, which is not a bad option.","<strong>Online POS Systems: What We Evaluated, What We Found</strong>","We assessed cloud POS systems to see how simple it is to perform routine management and sales functions. We also compared features such as payment processing, management tools, customer management tools and professional support options. We learned that, for the most part, sales functions are simple to perform, as they should be, since sales staff often receive minimal training. Management functions are more difficult to master, but the best systems come with adequate instruction.","We compared features as well. The best online POS systems are flexible in terms of supporting a number of – not just one – payment processors. If you already have a credit card processor, you&#39;ll want to check with them to ensure your new POS system is compatible with your processor.","We also considered each POS system&#39;s reporting options and convenience features, such as the option to integrate with an online store and the ability to send receipts to customers&#39; mobile phones. If you are not sure what features you need, be sure to read our article, &#34;<a href=\"/electronics/mobile\">Where to Start</a>,&#34; to help you decide which features could help you more efficiently run your business.","<strong>What If the Internet Goes Down: True Offline Mode Explained</strong>","One of the most common concerns business owners have is that they will not be able to process sales or send orders to the kitchen if their internet service is interrupted. Because of this legitimate concern, many POS companies have developed ways to process sales and kitchen orders offline if the internet connection is out and then sync sales when service is restored.","<strong>Processing Credit Card Sales</strong><br/>To <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">process credit cards</a>, your system will need to be connected to the processor via the internet, traditional phone line or 3/4G connection. However, there are a few built-in workarounds. Most POS systems can cache payments until the internet is restored and then run them as a batch. Some can even switch between an internet and mobile connection depending on what is available.","If you decide to utilize a separate credit card terminal to run your cards, you can choose one that connects via the internet or analog phone line so you can process sales regardless of internet access. Terminals that process credit cards by a cellular connection are also available. Verifone is a hardware provider that offers numerous credit-card processing terminal options. You may also want to contact your current credit-card processing service to see if mobile options are available.","<strong>Processing Restaurant Orders &amp; Kitchen Orders</strong><br/>If you rely on your POS system to help you run your restaurant, including sending orders to the kitchen, you may want to consider one compatible with an onsite router that connects all of your POS devices. A router sends information via Wi-Fi between your devices, such as instantly transmitting orders to the kitchen directly from servers out on the floor.  Revel and Lightspeed are examples of POS companies that offer router options. If you feel your business can benefit from this technology, ask your POS company contact what is available before purchasing a system.","<strong>Our Verdict &amp; Recommendations</strong>","Our top three products, Revel, Vend, and Lightspeed, scored rather closely, but there are some important differences between each one. We found Revel Systems offered the most features, and it regularly adds new features. It also supports numerous types of business, even mobile businesses. Vend is a simple-to-use, feature-rich option for retail shops or simple counter-serve restaurants. Lightspeed continues to evolve its product. If offers retail, restaurant and eCommerce versions. Other good retail options to consider include <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/business/payment-processing/best-pos-systems/\">ShopKeep</a> and <a href=\"https://www.toptenreviews.com/business/payment-processing/best-pos-systems/\">Shopify</a>.
