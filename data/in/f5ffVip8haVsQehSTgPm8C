You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","<a href=\"/home/auto/best-backup-camera\">Rearview cameras</a> augment your ability to see what&#39;s behind your vehicle. The Kenwood CMOS-300 is such a device. Its wide viewing angle, back-guide line indicator, multiple view modes and more make it a good choice. We would like to have seen this unit bundled with its own monitor. If Kenwood added this feature, the CMOS-300 would have ranked higher on our side-by-side comparison chart.","There are several praise-worthy features on the Kenwood CMOS-300. Chief among them is its super-wide viewing angle. At 190 degrees, it&#39;s the widest of any back-up camera we reviewed. This means that not only can you see what is directly behind your vehicle, but also that you have a substantial view of the lanes on either side of traffic.","One of the primary functions of back-up cameras is helping drivers parallel park. The Kenwood CMOS-300 displays back-guide line indicators. This function detects exactly how far you are from the vehicle behind you when you&#39;re parking on the street. It then displays the precise angle and speed you need follow to park perfectly every time.","The Kenwood CMOS-300 supports multiple cameras. If you choose a multi-camera setup for your vehicle, the CMOS-300 provides you with a camera-view selection button. This function allows you to switch the display to show all the cameras you have mounted to your vehicle&#39;s frame.","If you wish to see multiple camera views simultaneously, the CMOS-300 features a picture-in-picture function. This feature functions the exact same way as a picture-in-picture does on your home television. The camera you select as the primary shows in the display, while the secondary camera occupies a smaller portion of the screen, usually in the upper left corner, although you can configure that however you want.","The picture resolution produced by the CMOS-300 measures 640 by 480 pixels. With one exception, this resolution beats every other back-up camera on our side by comparison chart. It&#39;s more than enough screen real estate to see the images your camera captures clearly. It&#39;s by no means high definition, but then most monitors built into dashboards lack the ability to display HD anyway.","All the great features we&#39;ve mentioned so far are reliant on one key assumption. Kenwood assumes that you already have a monitor or display installed in your vehicle. By its nature, the CMOS-300 is an aftermarket product. If you own a vehicle that does not have an in-dash display, you cannot use this product unless you buy another aftermarket product in the form of a display.","Installing two separate aftermarket items in your vehicle to achieve a single function is a hassle. You have to do a bit of research to discover the compatibility of the CMOS-300 for whichever display you choose to buy. The lack of an included monitor is a serious drawback, especially considering how much you&#39;re paying for the camera."]},"id":"c1f36636-590f-4a1b-97dd-6d5917099dd5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"22181447-e85b-4f07-8258-9b09d9abd7ef","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Kenwood CMOS-300</strong> is an outstanding rearview camera.
