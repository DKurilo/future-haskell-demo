Keeping everything in your head   or on the back of a napkin   risks confusion and loss of focus. Business plan software, such as <a href=\"/business/services/best-diy-business-plans/business-plan-pro-review/\">Business Plan Pro</a>, <a href=\"/business/services/best-diy-business-plans/bizplanbuilder-review/\">BizPlanBuilder</a> or <a href=\"/business/services/best-diy-business-plans/business-planmaker-review/\">Business PlanMaker</a>, helps you organize goals and plans for your startup.","Business plans not only help you prepare for startup; they also help your company stay on track through first months and years. Most experts recommend updating your business plan on a regular basis, especially if you use it to entice investors or partners. Software can assist you in creating and maintaining a variety of plans, from general business plans to marketing plans.","<strong>DIY Business Plans: What to Look For</strong>","Business plan software includes options such simple fill-in-the-blank templates or legal programs that help you navigate incorporation and contract development. Selecting the right plan lets you create a business plan most likely to help you succeed.","<strong>Templates &amp; Sample Documents</strong><br/>One of the most important aspects of software for business planning is the inclusion of sample documents and templates. Sample documents provide you with an idea of correct business plan formats, so you know what type of information to gather before getting started. Templates provide the bones of a document, allowing you to enter information without typing the entire plan from start to finish.","<strong>Support of Multiple Plan Types</strong><br/>Some software is designed for a specific industry or business; others provide information and templates for creating general plans that work in a variety of arenas. The most robust programs let you select from common industries and may even include options for start-up, investor or marketing business plans. When opening a niche business, such as a coffee shop, look for software that meets industry needs. Otherwise, select general or all-inclusive products.","<strong>Technical Support</strong><br/>DIY business plan products are generally designed to be user-friendly and walk you through the business planning process, but you may run into technical issues as you download, install or use the program. Free tech support options help ensure you get optimal benefits from your purchase. Look for products that come with at least two tech support options, including email, forums, telephone or online chat support.","<strong>Software Specifications</strong><br/>As with any software, you&#39;ll need to ensure the business planning product you purchase will work on your computer. Take a few minutes to compare the software requirements, such as memory and operating system, with your computer. If you plan to use the product to co-create a plan with another person or team, you may need to purchase multiple licenses or opt for a cloud-based version with multiple logins.","Business planning tools let you start organized and in control. Using the right tools throughout your company&#39;s early years can help you stay in control for increased chances of success."]},"id":"a05728ca-bfb9-4281-88cb-6722657a55aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"c9683772-bb90-4308-8c90-958867b67aa6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://track.paloalto.com/aff_c?offer_id=6&aff_id=6699&source=DIYBusinessPlansBPP\">Business Plan Pro</a>","<a href=\"https://www.cleverbridge.com/624/cookie?affiliate=1454&redirectto=http%3a%2f%2fwww.individualsoftware.com%2fdownloads%2fbusiness_planning%2fbx%2f\">Business PlanMaker</a>","<a href=\"http://www.simpleplanning.net/Business/BusinessSuite.html\">Business Suite</a>","<a href=\"http://www.iplanner.net/business-financial/online/templates.aspx\">iPlanner</a>","<a href=\"http://track.paloalto.com/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=6699&source=DIYBusinessPlansLP\">LivePlan</a>","<a href=\"https://www.cleverbridge.com/624/cookie?affiliate=1454&x-at=DIYBusinessPlans&redirectto=https%3a%2f%2fwww.cleverbridge.com%2f624%2f%3faffiliate%3d1454%26scope%3dcheckout%26cart%3d165389\">Nolo Quicken</a>","<a href=\"http://business-plan.planmagic.com/business-plan.html\">PlanMagic</a>","<a href=\"http://www.brs-inc.com/business_plan.asp\">PlanWrite</a>","<a href=\"http://www.foodsoftware.com/Product_0005_01.asp?ClkVen=F\">QuickPlan Restaurant</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"788ced34-971f-4f48-bc2d-0c2a81d02d38","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1466","url":"/best-diy-business-plans","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-01-30T17:20:15Z","datePublished":"2016-11-11T21:06:19Z","name":"DIY Business Plans Review","synopsis":"Starting your own business is an exciting experience that comes with complex financial, legal and management concerns.
