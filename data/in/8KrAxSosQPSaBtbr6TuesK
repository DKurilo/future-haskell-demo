You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Oregon Scientific Grill-Right Bluetooth BBQ Thermometer is too smart for its own good. This <a href=\"/best-digital-grill-thermometers\">digital grill thermometer</a> is supposed to help you monitor temperature from afar while you are grilling, and it does that  – quite accurately too. However, it is extremely complex and difficult to use.","The Grill-Right is a small black box that resembles an old computer monitor. It has an illuminated orange LCD screen that displays large numbers, which are easy to read, even in the dark.","This BBQ thermometer has four touch buttons on its front: start, set, a minus and plus button. These buttons provide no haptic feedback, so you have no idea if your presses have registered. We even struggled to power the device on. After five or so tries, it powered on.","Pairing a smartphone was even more difficult. You are supposed to press and hold the minus and plus buttons simultaneously until the screen displays a Bluetooth icon. We tried short-presses, long-presses, and the thermometer just didn’t respond. Finally, after several attempts, the icon appeared, and we were able to pair an iPhone 5S after installing the Grill-Right app. Android support is also available, but it is important to note your device must have Bluetooth 4.0, which several older smartphones and tablets do not have.","You don’t need to pair your smartphone or tablet to use this digital BBQ thermometer. It  has several built-in presets, temperature settings and menus. You can select doneness levels based on whether you&#39;re cooking beef, veal, lamb, pork, chicken, turkey, or fish from the display. However, it is much easier to just use the app.","We like that you can set alarms based on temperature or time spent cooking. However, selecting these options was too confusing. There is no cancel, back or clear button, so it seemed like we were in a loop scrolling through menus. Even if you are using the app, you do not receive a notification that your food is done. The app has a progress bar but without notifications, you have to keep checking your phone. When the alarm goes off, it is extremely loud.","The thermometer is incredibly accurate; Oregon Scientific says the thermometer is accurate within one degree, which we found to be true. It has a temperature range of 32-572 degrees Fahrenheit.","It was also relatively fast at reading temperatures. It took an average of 15.75 seconds when we cooked four steaks at rare, medium-rare, medium and medium-well. We like that this thermometer supports multiple probes, but only one probe is included with the unit. You can purchase an additional probe for about $20.","Oregon Scientific offers a one-year warranty with its grill thermometer. It has telephone and email support, and you can find a downloadable manual and FAQ on its website."]},"id":"53f4639c-7106-4871-9dad-e98cb31aabed","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c2619d18-e311-47c3-a698-32ee699fc77d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Oregon Scientific&#39;s Grill-Right Bluetooth BBQ Thermometer seems like the perfect BBQ thermometer.
