You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.","The ECTACO jetBook Color 2 is hardly your garden-variety <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eBook reader</a>. Originally designed for educational markets, the device is the first dedicated eReader with a color e-ink screen. ECTACO deserves credit for such an ambitious and uncharted effort, but the color screen fails to impress for an eReading device, particularly considering the hefty price tag.","The 9.7-inch screen is a no-glare, front-lit display, offering readability in virtually any environment. Add to that the color-enabled screen, and the jetBook Color 2 delivers a unique reading experience that sets it apart from its monochromatic counterparts. Unfortunately, the color screen isn’t that impressive and doesn’t justify the price that rivals a high-end LCD tablet. The colors appear dull, and the background is noticeably gray. This is simply a flaw of e-ink technology and its inability to render high-contrast colors.","Another issue with the jetBook Color 2 is that it is the least portable device in our eReader reviews. It weighs roughly a pound and a half, so most people will find it takes two hands to comfortably hold the device. The device also doesn’t have its own eBookstore, so you’ll have to download non-proprietary eBook files on your own.","Despite its drawbacks, the ECTACO eBook reader delivers some unique and appealing features, particularly for students and other educational readers. Aside from its ability to display picture books in color and highlight text, the eReader comes preloaded with dictionaries, a vocabulary builder, a graphing calculator and comprehensive file support. Additionally, it supports audiobooks and has a text-to-speech feature that will read content aloud to you. Multi-language support also makes it a good option for international or multilingual readers. Considering these features and others, there’s no denying that the jetBook Color 2 can be a useful device. But the leisure reader certainly won&#39;t get the most enjoyment out of it."]},"id":"c1579652-4c8a-4489-9b7e-443265426c6b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"82913eb5-b345-42c2-b742-b090773a44b1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ECTACO jetBook Color 2 is likely to have limited appeal among the book-reading masses.
