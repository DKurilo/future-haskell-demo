The DMCA makes no exceptions for circumventing these encryptions for personal use. Top Ten Reviews does not endorse piracy or any other illegal activity.</em>","Alcohol 120% is a disc-authoring program that allows you to <a href=\"/software/multimedia/best-blu-ray-to-blu-ray-copy-software/\">copy Blu-ray discs</a>. It also has tools so you can make CDs, DVDs, video game discs and more. However, this application is designed more for the advanced user than novice or casual users, plus you&#39;re limited with the discs you can copy.","The first thing to understand about Alcohol 120% is that it&#39;s designed for advanced users. If you&#39;ve never dabbled in optical disc authoring before, you may want to choose a different program. That said, the copy wizard makes it relatively easy to duplicate your physical Blu-ray discs. This feature is located on the left side of the interface. Once you select the copy wizard, all you have to do is put the Blu-ray disc you want to copy in the tray and follow the prompts. It only takes a few clicks to start the copying process.","The second thing to know is that you can&#39;t use this application to copy commercial discs. Alcohol 120% doesn&#39;t contain the appropriate decryption algorithms that bypass the antipiracy protections found on almost all commercially produced Blu-ray movies. This means you can only copy homemade and unprotected discs. The <a href=\"/software/multimedia/best-blu-ray-to-blu-ray-copy-software/blue-cloner-review/\">best Blu-ray copiers</a> we reviewed allow you to duplicate any disc – even if it is encrypted.","Like all the Blu-ray copy software reviewed, making a disc-to-disc copy using Alcohol 120% can take hours. This is because files on Blu-ray discs can be as large as 100 GB – and it takes a long time for your computer to process that much data. If you&#39;re going use this program to make multiple copies of a Blu-ray, we recommend extracting its disc image to your hard drive first and then burning new copies from that. It will literally save you hours of time versus burning each copy from the original disc.","In our tests, it took this program 48 minutes to burn a new physical copy of a Blu-ray disc image saved to our test computer. This time is average among the Blu-ray copiers we reviewed. The new disc was identical to the original – our video experts couldn&#39;t detect any quality loss whatsoever in the video or audio of the new disc."]},"id":"4a2ad89f-e348-4437-ab21-7a363516c3ec","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a9adef1c-b3c0-4d47-96a2-7f6fbf674ade","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Alcohol 120% is a great program for advanced users who create a lot of optical discs.
