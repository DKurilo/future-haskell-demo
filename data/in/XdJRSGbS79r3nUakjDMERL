You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","The Nuvi 205W is the most basic of Garmin’s wide screen Nuvi 2x5W line but it still features many of the most important features of  the rest of the line. Most noticeable is the 4.3-inch, diagonally measured, touchscreen. It has the same 480 x 272 pixel resolution for easily readable text and map display and it is viewable in just about any lighting situation. The touchscreen is responsive and the straight forward user interface should be welcomed by most first time GPS device users.","The Nuvi 205W shares most operational features with the more highly rated, and pricier, Nuvi 255W with one important exception. The Nuvi 205W lacks text to speech technology so rather than telling you which street you’ll be turning on by name, it will give a less useful instruction such as “Turn left in 40 yards.” This may seem like a trivial difference, but in practice, knowing the street name without having to glance at the screen is invaluable from both a convenience and safe driving perspective. Though not having this feature makes the device more affordable, we believe that the margin of safety gained by including text to speech is worth the additional investment.","On a positive note, this unit shares the “Where Am I?” security feature with other Garmin Nuvi devices. With it you can always find your precise location instantly along with the nearest address and intersection and how to locate the nearest emergency facilities.","The Garmin Nuvi 205W has the ability to receive real time traffic information but only with the addition of an optional FM receiver and subscription to a traffic service. Its preloaded maps are limited to the contiguous United States, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.","There are several helpful features included with this device which aren’t related directly to navigation. They include a calculator with currency and measurement conversions, a world clock, and a JPEG photo viewer.<br/> "]},"id":"bcb9ec6e-04e7-44dd-bcdc-5741f935f22b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_44962","url":"/garmin-nuvi-205w-45793-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-03-25T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-03-25T06:00:00Z","name":"Garmin Nuvi 205W nuvi 205W","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":21,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-03-25T22:32:40Z","id":"XdJRSGbS79r3nUakjDMERL","meta":{"title":"Garmin Nuvi 205W nuvi 205W Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Check out the Garmin Nuvi 205W!
