Black &amp; Decker also offers this toaster in a two-slice version, model number T2030. The stainless steel cross section and function indicator lights elevate this above standard two- or four-slice toasters. The dual controls on the four-slice model provide a way for you to toast bread on different shade settings at the same time. This is good for larger families that need to have multiple pastries and breads toasting in the morning to get family members out the door.","The extra-wide slots in this Black &amp; Decker toaster are ideal for toasting bagels, buns, pastries, muffins and artisan breads. The self-adjusting guides center the bread between the heating elements to provide an even browning. The high-lift slots are great for retrieving smaller pieces of bread when the toasting cycle is complete, so you won’t need to use tongs or a fork. There are only six preset shade settings with the Black &amp; Decker toaster. However, the large dial does provide plenty of room between the preset settings, so you can adjust the browning level between the settings to get a more customized shade.","One of the best design features of the Black &amp; Decker is the cool-touch exterior. The toaster does have a stainless steel cross section, and normally stainless steel toasters can cause burns if you touch the sides during use. However, the Black &amp; Decker provides a cool-touch exterior that allows you to touch the sides and adjust the controls without the fear of burning yourself. On the other hand, the black cool-touch sides overtake the stainless cross section from an aesthetic perspective. Overall, the Black &amp; Decker likely won’t be toaster you&#39;d want to display as a permanent fixture on your designer counter tops.","This Black &amp; Decker toaster has a standard one-year limited warranty that covers manufacturer defects. Black &amp; Decker has a telephone support line and an email form, so you can contact the company if you have other questions or concerns about your toaster."]},"id":"e40b4b90-e29b-436b-9e37-35e6e25db5d7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4c5e0c70-0bf3-426f-889b-10634345326d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Black &amp; Decker four-slice toaster does have some nice features, such as its cool-touch exterior, extra-wide slots and extra-lift function.
