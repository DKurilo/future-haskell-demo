Despite this, it&#39;s among the most easy-to-use programs we reviewed, and it includes many features that we could not find anywhere else, the main one being the Inspector tool.","With the Inspector, you can view a plethora of information by selecting different options from the dropdown menu. These options include general recipes, detailed source information, copyright information, images of the final product, preparation times, flavor descriptions, cost, taste pairings, user-specified nutritional information, dietary exchange information and notes. This level of recipe customization and description is an invaluable asset to any cook, especially if you have a large collection of recipes that you need to sort through quickly.","This recipe manager for Mac also offers customizable color themes, which offer no practical value but make for a more aesthetically pleasing display. These themes also transfer to the full-screen cooking mode, which makes reading while cooking a bit easier.","Another great feature iCuistot offers is the conversions tool, which lets you adjust ingredient measurements of length, temperature, volume or weight as needed. A surprising number of Mac recipe software programs do not include adequate conversion tools, and it is refreshing to see a basic program that offers such a convenient tool.","In addition to these convenient features, iCuistot provides information about food safety, such as how to maintain clean surfaces and safe food temperatures or prevent cross-contamination. However, iCuistot&#39;s weak point is its lack of a shopping list function and menu planning features. This is the only program we reviewed that doesn&#39;t have these useful features.","As for help and support options, the user guide is thorough and well organized. The developer&#39;s website only offers an email form, however, lacking a FAQs section, blog and user forum. With the software&#39;s straightforward user interface, support will not likely be necessary, but it is reassuring to know that resources are available if you need them."]},"id":"d8f47e6c-ff28-4864-8513-39732ec680a9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"566221c9-ad01-43db-923b-b2134484bc34","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When it comes to digital recipe storage, iCuistot is an excellent choice.
