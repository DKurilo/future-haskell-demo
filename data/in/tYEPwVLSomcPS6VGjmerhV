However, the design of this <a href=\"/best-air-purifiers\">air purifier</a> demands that you show it off, as you can add customized panels to the front of it that feature artwork from famous artists, including Vincent Van Gogh, Gustav Klimt and Katsushika Hokusai. In addition to this unique and artistic design, the MinusA2 is great at cleaning the air in small rooms and has a number of unique features.","The MinusA2, according to AHAM&#39;s room coverage formula, effectively cleans the air in rooms up to 300 square feet. You can increase the effectiveness of your air purifier by using it in smaller rooms; using it in larger rooms slows down its ability to remove pollutants from the air. The machine can produce over three air changes per hour, meaning all the air in the room filters through the purifier every 18 minutes or so. This makes the MinusA2 especially useful for those who suffer from allergies or other breathing-related issues.","The purifier has a six-filter system. First, particles pass through the washable pre-filter and then move through the medium filter. Most large particles are caught in these two filters. Next, the true HEPA filter captures the smallest pollutants, ranging from the relatively large pollen particulates to the very small smoke particles. In the fourth cleaning stage, air passes through one of Rabbit Air&#39;s four custom filters that you choose when you purchase the model. You have the choice of the Germ Defense, Pet Allergy, Toxin Absorber and Odor Remover filters, depending on your specific environmental needs. Next, a carbon filter reduces the potency of strong odors. Finally, the optional ionizer charges exiting air to make it easier to capture on its next pass through the machine.","You can mount the MinusA2 on your wall, which is a unique design feature that gives you even more placement options. With the custom artistic panels, you can change a standard-looking appliance into a piece of art that you can hang on your wall. One of the standout features of the MinusA2 is the air-quality sensor on the front. This lighted bar changes colors to indicate the pollution level in the area so you know when you need the purifier. In addition, the filter monitor tells you when it&#39;s time to change an air filter. This home air purifier also includes a sleep mode to avoid disturbing you at night while it runs.","The MinusA2 is Energy Star verified, meaning it consumes less energy than models that lack this verification mark. In our testing, we found the unit uses about 95 watts on its highest settings, which is just above the average consumption of the models we reviewed. The California Air Research Board has certified the MinusA2, meaning it produces little or no emissions during operation. However, the model is not AHAM verified, which means Rabbit Air may or may not have followed the testing procedures AHAM created as an industry standard.","Unfortunately, this air cleaner lacks an operation timer, which means you can&#39;t program it to run at specific times of the day. However, it does have an auto mode, which uses the air-quality sensor to measure the level of pollutants in your home so it can clean the air as needed.","Rabbit Air offers a variety of support options, including a detailed FAQs section and downloadable user manuals on its website. Representatives are available by online chat, telephone and email. The MinusA2 has a five-year warranty, which gives you plenty of time to take care of any manufacturer defects."]},"id":"677e0542-8dc2-49bf-a7b2-cc6df77e8d4e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2a5f9f2d-2158-4a21-b97f-faf402907afd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Rabbit Air MinusA2 is a quiet air purifier with a beautiful, modern design.
