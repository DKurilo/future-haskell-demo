This <a href=\"/best-photo-recovery-software\">photo recovery software</a> allows you to preview your images before you initiate the recovery, so you don’t have to recover every photo if you just need a few. While the installation and recovery stages are exceptionally easy to get through, the scanning step of the process is a big more complicated than it is with most image recovery software.","In our tests, Wondershare’s image recovery rates were underwhelming. We simulated two data loss scenarios on an HDD, SSD and SD card. The first test was for lost files – a situation where the file is no longer accessible in the file directory. The second test simulated data loss from a reformatted drive. In every test, Wondershare posted below-average recovery rates, though it did recognize most of the common digital camera raw formats.","The biggest downside to Wondershare Photo Recovery is its 50 percent recovery rate for JPGs in both of our tests. This is the most common and easy-to-recover image format for photos, which makes it the most important format for image recovery software to be able to rescue. While the 50 percent recovery rate is impressive compared to the 7 percent recovery rate of free photo recovery software, it doesn’t compare to the best photo recovery software. For reference, seven of the products we tested posted a 100 percent recovery rate for JPGs.","This software didn’t fare well with other formats, either. In both tests, it recorded a 50 percent recovery rate for other raster formats – GIF, BMP, TIF and PNG. It recovered 32 percent of the production images and failed to recover a single vector image. It recovered 19 percent of the camera raw images in the lost file test, which is well below the average in our test. On a slightly positive note, it recovered 23 of the camera raw images in the reformatted drive test. That was its only recovery rate that was above average, albeit barely. If you want a more well-rounded and powerful program, check out <a href=\"/o-o-mediarecovery-review\">O&amp;O MediaRecovery</a>.","The best note to come out of testing was the software recognizing all but one of the camera raw image formats. It may not have recovered a high percentage of the raw images, but this picture recovery software proved that it could recognize every raw format except Polaroid’s proprietary X3F. This makes it useful for serious photographers recovering data from the memory cards used in their DSLR cameras.","Wondershare Photo Recovery recognizes camera raw formats better than most photo recovery apps we reviewed, but its overall recovery rates are still subpar. The biggest disappointment is its poor recovery of JPG files, which is the most common image format. This program is best suited for photographers looking to recover digital camera raw images."]},"id":"36e9b405-54f1-446f-bf8c-f7bbcb7eae21","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53052","url":"/wondershare-photo-recovery-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-06-21T17:48:08Z","datePublished":"2011-06-21T17:48:08Z","name":"Wondershare Photo Recovery","synopsis":"According to its developer, Wondershare Photo Recovery can rescue your photos, movies and music from viruses, crashes, accidental deletion and other data loss scenarios.","review":{"rating":70,"verdict":"Since it recognizes most raw formats, Wondershare Photo Recovery may be attractive to serious photographers.
