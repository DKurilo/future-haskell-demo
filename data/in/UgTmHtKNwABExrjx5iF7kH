(Redwood City, California) is standalone Windows firewall software that stops traffic threats that are arriving or departing from a personal computer. The firewall cooperates with antivirus software and antispyware from competing vendors.","<strong>Firewall Performance</strong><br/>Firewalls serve to protect by preventing infections. When infections sneak past the firewall, they become the responsibility of other guardians, namely antivirus software and antispyware. Once upon a time, the ZoneAlarm Pro Firewall included privacy control and scanned incoming email. Now that browsers have web-privacy controls and email applications scan incoming attachments, Check Point has streamlined ZoneAlarm Pro Firewall to avoid redundant functionality.","<strong>Additional Security Features</strong><br/>Other noteworthy features include the ability to analyze the potential danger of a downloaded program and the ability to authenticate when and where a website was registered and whether it is dangerous or safe. Although ZoneAlarm Pro does not scan incoming email, it does scan outgoing email for malignancies. The product includes an option to test a download in a safe virtual environment in case it manifests dangerous characteristics.","ZoneAlarm Pro Firewall includes many thoughtful touches that make it easy to be safe. Novices and experts can select appropriate configuration/management levels. If the firewall detects that it is in danger of being hijacked or sabotaged, it retreats into a completely protected state. A toolbar supports the antiphishing and site-status features.","A ZoneAlarm Pro-protected computer offers a dialog box in order set security levels in new network environments without having to open and configure a ZoneAlarm Pro window. The product makes it convenient to include printers and devices in a trusted network zone so that network functionality is not sacrificed to security.","The product can train itself to configure settings based on user behavior. It automatically updates itself to maintain current security lists. Users can control when and why the firewall sends alerts. Alerts are suppressible with one click for times when they might interfere with a game or other application where alerts might intrude on fun.","<strong>Help &amp; Support </strong><br/>Check Point’s sincere desire to differentiate itself from the competition is evident in the product design features as well as in the unusually comprehensive help and support. In addition to an online knowledge base, a blog, a user forum and a presence on Facebook and Twitter, Check Point offers customer-service chat 24/7. Technical-support chat is available on weekdays from 8am to 10pm in the United States (CST). After purchasing the product a user can return the product for a refund within 30 days. Version upgrades are free for the first 12 months. For customers who wind up in situations where Internet/email access goes down and they cannot close or uninstall ZoneAlarm Pro Firewall, Check Point maintains a telephone number dedicated to their rescue. In addition to the layers of protection in the ZoneAlarm Pro Firewall, the product includes a 12-month subscription to an identity protection service (for United States customers)."]},"id":"b5ad4f52-04fd-45b8-a301-17c628b7a49e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7dbc84e8-45a5-467f-84da-81f1b9b7fe39","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Check Point’s dedication to excellence is evident in the product design, implementation of features, ease of use and help and support.
