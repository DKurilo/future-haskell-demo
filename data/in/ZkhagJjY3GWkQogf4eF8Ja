This could cause some concern when you&#39;re listening and watching for any sign that your baby needs you.","The resolution is one of the best of the video baby monitors we tested. This gives you a crisp image whether you use the small screen of your cell phone or the larger iPad. The ability to use a larger device, such as a tablet, makes it easier to view multiple cameras at once. The Philips Avent Smart baby monitor SCD860 allows you to connect up to 10 cameras at once, but you have to buy those cameras separately.","Controlling the camera from the app is as easy as swiping the screen, so you can zoom in on your baby for a closer look or pan across the room to see more to the left or right.
