Here&#39;s more on choosing Mac personal finance software that meets your needs, along with detail on how we arrived at our ranking of these 10 programs.</em>","Managing your money can feel like a daunting task when you look at the number of financial accounts you have, including checking and savings, credit cards, mortgages and auto loans, and retirement. Mac personal finance software can help you get a handle on your money by streamlining all of your accounts into a single program.","The best personal finance software for Mac programs saves you time by connecting to your financial institutions and then syncing with your account data, giving you a real-time look at your money. However, if the software doesn&#39;t recognize one of the financial institutions you use, you may need to manually import data into the program.","Another convenience the best programs offer are companion apps for iPhone and iPad that sync with the desktop version of the program. These integrated apps give you access to your account data so you can check your budget or individual accounts on your iPhone when you&#39;re out and about or on your iPad when you&#39;re relaxing on the patio after work.","Whether you prefer to check your accounts on your desktop or through an app, the benefit of using software that makes it convenient for you to use is significant because recent studies suggest that people who frequently review their finances are more likely to get ahead financially than people who don&#39;t regularly monitor their money.","You can <a href=\"/money\">read articles about the advantages of money management on our site</a>. If, in addition to managing your money, you also need help preparing your taxes, check out our <a href=\"/best-online-tax-software\">Online Tax Software</a> review. If you need software that helps you manage your business finances, our <a href=\"/best-billing-and-invoice-software\">Accounting Software</a> review may be useful to you.","<strong>What You Should Expect From Mac Personal Finance Software</strong>","Budgeting tools are included with all Mac personal finance software, and you should expect them to be feature-rich, with flexibility in how you organize and label your transactions. It should give you the option of splitting transactions and adding notes, including scanned copies of receipts.","The software should allow you to manually import data from your accounts using common CSV or Excel formats. Additionally, you should expect the software to generate a variety of reports, including those that analyze your spending over a period of time or by category. The software should have bank-grade security as well as password protection and two-factor authentication."]},"id":"261c0b4c-ce6f-461f-be37-6d763779b2ca","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"What We Evaluated, What We Found"},"id":"1a8ff0f0-b8c9-4374-aa17-8e6aad42b623","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You&#39;re more likely to regularly use Mac personal finance software if it&#39;s intuitive to learn, if it&#39;s easy to maintain, and if you can access it on your iPhone and iPad. We looked online for Mac financial software with these qualities and then tested them on desktop computers. When available, we installed the companion apps on an iPhone and iPad to examine the cross functionality of each program.","In our testing, we found the key differentiators between each application to be the connectivity of the software with other devices and your financial institutions, the strength of the budgeting and reporting features, and the ability of the software to monitor your personal investments.","<strong>Connectivity: Device Apps Are Not Universally Available</strong><br/>The best Mac personal finance programs have mobile apps that integrate with the software and give you a real-time overview of your accounts, track your budget and add cash transactions. Some also give you the ability to create alerts that notify you when your accounts are active. For example, you might decide that you want an alert when you make an automatic payment, receive a deposit into an account, or when you&#39;ve reached a spending limit you&#39;ve set in your budget.","The mobile apps connect to the software in a variety of ways, either syncing automatically or manually, through Dropbox, or through an online account. Several apps work with Apple Watch, and <a href=\"/ynab-review\">YNAB</a> is unique in that it also works with Amazon Alexa. Buxfer and <a href=\"/mvelopes-review\">Mvelopes</a> in particular stood out.","<strong>Investment Accounts: The Capabilities Vary</strong><br/>Another toolset that not all Mac personal finance software includes is that for investment accounts. The best programs give you the option of connecting with your retirement and other investment accounts so you can see how your accounts are performing, analyze how your assets are allocated, and track fees associated with your investments.","<strong>Reporting: Monitor Your Money</strong><br/>Every Mac personal finance software we reviewed featured some kind of reporting capability. This varied from simply tracking your net worth and spending to more robust reporting that keeps track of your investments. The best software also allows you to create tax reports and export them to a tax program.","<strong>What Else Is Important When Selecting Mac Personal Finance Software?</strong>","As you determine which Mac personal finance software best meets your money-management needs, some additional capabilities to consider are whether the software connects to all of your financial accounts, and how easy the software makes it to create a monthly budget and track your transactions.","<strong>Connect to All Your Accounts </strong><br/>Using the best Mac personal finance software, you can connect to all of your financial accounts, including those at banks and credit unions, like your checking and savings accounts, and online payable accounts like your credit cards.","The quality of the connections also vary. Some of the software we reviewed uses a different protocol. For example, <a href=\"/ifinance-review\">iFinance</a> uses HBCI technology that&#39;s better suited to European banks. When you connect financial software for Mac with your account, the software imports your transactions. You then tag them and assign them to various categories, such as groceries, phone or auto, for budgeting purposes. Quicken for Mac and <a href=\"/banktivity-review\">Banktivity</a> can automatically tag the transactions you import.","<strong>Create a Budget and Manage Your Money</strong><br/>Once you connect your accounts and sync your data, you&#39;re most likely to spend the majority of your time with the software performing monthly budgeting tasks. For this reason, it&#39;s important to choose finance software for Mac with a robust set of budgeting tools that helps you create a budget quickly, enters any manual transactions easily – such as those for cash – and performs additional budgeting tasks with ease.","If your budget is relatively stable month to month, look for a program that lets you copy your budget to subsequent months. If goal-setting is an important part of your budgeting strategy, look for a program that supports these tasks.","<strong>Our Verdict &amp; Recommendations</strong>","The best Mac personal finance software is one that you&#39;ll use regularly. It makes it easy for you to gather all of your account data together in one program so you see exactly where you stand financially. It connects to your accounts, which saves you the time of importing your account data manually. Plus, it offers companion apps that sync with your iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, so you can check your data at your convenience, from wherever you are."]},"id":"42599d44-d3a6-448b-a25a-7b2ec312c05c","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["The best Mac personal finance software we reviewed was Quicken for Mac. It features the best options for monitoring personal investments as well as robust reporting tools that include options for exporting your tax information to a tax program.","Moneydance stands out because it allows you to pay bills directly through the program. This software is also compatible with Windows and Android operating systems.","Banktivity has excellent options for budgeting, including bill pay and budget alerts that tell you when you&#39;ve exceeded the limits you&#39;ve set. This personal finance software also automatically tags your transactions when you import them from your bank, which can help make setting up a budget simpler.","<a href=\"/moneywell-review\">Moneywell</a> is a good option if you&#39;re looking for Mac personal finance software with strong reporting capabilities. This software is one of four programs that can generate tax reports.","Buxfer, <a href=\"/countabout-review\">CountAbout</a> and YNAB are browser-based services, which means you log in to an online portal instead of installing software directly on your computer. They offer excellent budgeting options and highly usable apps. However, YNAB lacks any kind of ability to track investments and may not be ideal if you have a portfolio of assets you wish to monitor."],"type":"ul"},"id":"64ff259d-9e99-4352-a46a-24abbae32536","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"a0a2a8f0-ab93-47e8-9697-66ae956eec50","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M6USTSH/?&tag=ttr_mac_personal_finance_software-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|528[art|NA[pid|66177[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Quicken for Mac</a>","<a href=\"https://secure.bmtmicro.com/servlets/Orders.ShoppingCart?CID=495/3&CLR=0&PRODUCTID=4950106&AID=2128891\">Moneydance</a>","<a href=\"https://www.buxfer.com/pricing\">Buxfer</a>","<a href=\"https://secure.iggsoftware.com/store/\">Banktivity</a>","<a href=\"https://countabout.com/landing/Pricing\">CountAbout</a>","<a href=\"https://www.mvelopes.com/pricing/\">Mvelopes</a>","<a href=\"https://www.moneyspire.com/purchase/\">Moneyspire</a>","<a href=\"https://www.youneedabudget.com/\">YNAB</a>","<a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifinance-4/id992363116?mt=8&at=1l3v52U\">iFinance</a>","<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moneywell/id404246493?mt=12&uo=4&at=1l3v52U\">MoneyWell</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3dcc1061-8987-47b8-b742-dcb2bab756fd","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_528","url":"/best-mac-personal-finance-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"lori-fairbanks","url":"/author/lori-fairbanks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Lori Fairbanks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"p6N3q9MSBBLsV6BQ4Qpsyc","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-05-25T17:16:38Z","datePublished":"2017-01-06T22:07:28Z","name":"Mac Personal Finance Software Review","synopsis":"Find the Mac personal finance software application that gives you the tools you need to establish a budget, analyze the performance of your investment accounts and create reports that help you evaluate spending patterns.","review":{},"strapline":"Find the Mac personal finance software application that gives you the tools you need to establish a budget, analyze the performance of your investment accounts and create reports that help you evaluate spending patterns.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-06-20T23:01:46Z","id":"SgkAzM2ELvuVpL5rUHySFk","meta":{"title":"The Best Mac Personal Finance Software of 2017","description":"Our teams have compared the best MAC personal finance software for 2017.
