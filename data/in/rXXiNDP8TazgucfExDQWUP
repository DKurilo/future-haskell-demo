The Nike+FuelBand SE is a stylish, but tough, rubberized bracelet designed to track your activity throughout the day. Like a typical pedometer, it counts steps, calories and the distance you&#39;ve traveled.

The FuelBand uses the tri-axis accelerometer inside the bracelet to track your motion. From there, it uses algorithms to calculate your oxygen intake based on your correlating motion. The FuelPoints system produces inconsistent measurements. Instead of  reaching your goal through calories or steps, the FuelBand SE measures  your progress with algorithms based on activity. It calculates your  points through movement and estimates your oxygen intake from there.  This means you may get 500 points for simply walking to the store but 700 from a full work out session."]},"id":"aedb7e0f-4a5d-4f92-8c06-38fee838b5cc","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/gL9u9UMfqyHhcWJ2iqThYD.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"leaderboard, so you can see where you stand among your friends.
