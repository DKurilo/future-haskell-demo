Through this Support section you can access help and support resources directly for the digital photo frame. If you opt to go through the main site help and support link, you will continually need to type in the product and model number, which gets rather annoying. Through clicking the product’s Sony eSupport link you will be navigated to an eSupport page that provides resources such as: a live chat link, an email Sony link, a link for the documentation such as the manual, a Sony user forum and the option to search the Sony knowledgebase.","We tried to chat with Sony&#39;s support team but were unable to get the chat function to work properly. Instead, we sent an email regarding the digital picture frame. We instantly received an email acknowledging that Sony had received our support request. Under four hours later we received an email from a member of the Sony customer support team which addressed each of our questions and comments. We were very pleased with the ease we found in contacting the Sony eSupport team, the timeliness of their response and the appropriate answers we received.","Sony’s digital picture frame comes with a physical manual packaged with the product, as well as an online manual for backup. The manual is clean and easy to read and follow. The graphics and product information are organized in a clean and orderly fashion, which makes the manual easy to use. Several pages throughout the manual also offer tips and notes for the user that will help you get the most out of your product. Again, we were very impressed with the Sony help and support resources and had no problem accessing or retrieving the information we were looking for. Sony provides a one-year warranty with each digital photo frame as well, which should provide you with an assurance that you are getting a quality product."]},"id":"89632d44-321e-4481-a60c-f27d2b2888ed","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"15e9df55-ad8f-47e8-bc3a-8856bb28394f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sony truly excels in every area with the Sony 8” Digital Photo Frame (model number: DPF-D810).
