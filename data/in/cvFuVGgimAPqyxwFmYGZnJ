This is an outstanding <a href=\"/best-online-stock-trading-brokers\">online stock trading service</a> for frequent and experienced traders. This broker offers a variety of commission options. It also supports client education with a MB Trading wiki, a forum and webinars.","MB Trading offers excellent pricing for volume or frequent traders: $4.95 for market and limit trades. There are two commission plans: the MBTR flat rate plan (for up to 10,000 trades) and the MBTX per share plan. Both are $4.95. Futures trading is offered at 95 cents per trade plus exchange fees and options at 95 cents per contract with no minimum. However, there are no broker assisted trades so you are on your own using this service. MB Trading offers stocks, options and futures trading. In terms of futures, there is direct order routing to CME, NYMEX, CBOT and COMEX. There are 12 complex options strategies with one-click choices, so you are not required to enter multiple legs manually.","MB Trading offers various trading platforms: the MBT Navigator, MetaTrader 4 and MBT Navigator Wireless. MBT Navigator and MetaTrader 4 are fairly easy to use, especially if you are already familiar with trading software. There are free demo downloads online if you would like to check them out. There are two trading software programs and a cell phone version. MBT Mobile provides access to third-party programs for research, education, reference and time saving tools. For charting and analytics it provides access to eSignal, IntelliCharts, Ninja Trader, QCharts, OmniTrader Professional, TickQuest, TradeBullet, TopGun Software and ChartroomNavigator. There is trading education through 4x Connection, Cyber Trading University and Swing-Trading. Trade resources include Forex Factory and Jitney Group. Trade tools include software or services provided through AbleSys, Concord Exchange and Cool-Trade.","MB Trading is designed for web-based or cell phone trading, so there is no brick and mortar location that you can visit. But you can contact the broker by phone, email or chat. The trading and customer care help desks are available during standard EST business hours. The University/Technology and software support desk is available 24 hours a day."]},"id":"a8eeaee4-b165-4e3b-8b75-2a18c0b5f9a1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ff5ba2a8-4713-4594-a1be-23d7bcba0516","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With MB Trading, there is no need to have multiple accounts at various firms in order to diversify.
