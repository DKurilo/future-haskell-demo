We subscribe to news outlets, blogs and newsletters about computer privacy and safety to stay on top of new threats and changes in the industry. We also attend trade shows, such as the annual RSA Conference, and connect with other experts in the industry to ensure we know everything we can about keeping you and your family safe on your computer. Most of our testers and reviewers are parents themselves and use these types of programs in their own homes to keep their families safe.","<strong>How We Tested<br/></strong>To test privacy software, we browsed the internet and used files and programs on our test computer after installing the programs – our test machines had Windows operating systems installed on them. As we tested, we opened files, visited websites, sent email, and used popular applications like Microsoft Word, Outlook email service and instant chat programs. We performed the same tasks with the same programs and internet browsers each time we tested a new privacy software.","As we tested each program, we used all its available tools and scrubbed both our internet browser and Windows operating system. After each cleaning, we searched for any data tracks left behind, first manually using the computer’s search tools, then with a recovery program to bring back as much data as possible.","We used this data to learn which privacy programs are effective at cleaning Windows and internet browsers as well as what information, if any, is left behind. Some programs leave snippets of information behind, but most of these remnants weren’t enough to get a clear picture of the sites we visited or what we did on our computers.","<strong>How Much Does Privacy Software Cost?</strong>","Most privacy software requires a monthly or yearly subscription. The exact cost depends on how many devices you’ll need to scrub and the number of features you need. A yearly subscription can cost between $20 and $60, and some companies give a discount if you need more than one user license.","<strong>How to Choose Privacy Software<br/></strong>When you are ready to purchase privacy software, choose one that is easy to use and effective at scrubbing your local computer files and browser history. Additional features, such as those that scan and clean instant messaging programs, emails and cloud storage applications, are also good to have if you want to help your computer run at its best.","Ease of Use<br/>The more complicated a program is, the more likely you are to make a mistake and compromise your computer privacy. Complex programs may also be frustrating to use, so you might not run them as often as you should. We found that software with automatic features make it easy to protect your information on a regular basis. The best applications allow you to schedule times to scan and shred your personal information each day or let you choose to do so every time you exit a program. While all the products we reviewed have cleanup schedules, some have more extensive and customizable schedules than others.","We found that software with clearly labeled icons for Windows cleaning and internet browsers were the easiest to use. Using these top-rated programs, you simply mark the files you want scanned and shredded under each category. Most applications allow you to customize which parts of your computer or browser to scan, rather than wiping it in its entirety. This feature saves you time, and you can keep information you use on a regular basis. For example, you can save cookies to websites you use daily so you don’t have to manually enter information every time you visit.","Privacy Effectiveness<br/>History eraser software should keep your information private when you connect to the internet. After you disconnect, the best applications erase all evidence of your activities automatically so other people can’t reconstruct where you went or what you did while online. They also eliminate tracks of data, including usage history, recently opened files, temporary files, clipboard items and SWAP files, which show what you did through your operating system.","With the exception of a few programs, the privacy software we tested did a good job of securing our online privacy. We found minor traces of our internet activity when we used Privacy Eraser Pro and ParetoLogic Privacy Controls. When we tested Winsweeper and Winsettings Pro, we found traces of activity left behind in the address bar and internet browser history that could reveal to others what we had been doing online.","We learned that while each program wipes and shreds files, only the best privacy software completely erase Windows and internet browser data so it is unrecoverable. These programs include CyberScrub Privacy Suite and east-tech.","Feature Set<br/>If you want to protect everything you do on the computer, you want privacy software that cleans all the files on your computer, including instant messages and emails. The top-rated privacy programs also clear files on cloud-based storage services, such as Dropbox, as well as your saved passwords and access histories for them. Temporary internet files that save on your computer should also be cleaned to protect your privacy and to free up valuable computer space so your system runs quickly and efficiently.","Paying for Your Privacy<br/>Privacy software is frequently offered as a subscription-based service (SaaS). However, each program’s features and the techniques it uses are comparable between the software and SaaS versions. Typically, a paid subscription ensures you have the most up-to-date plugins for your computer’s applications. We reviewed software and subscription services that range in price from $20 to $60, with the price of services taken annually.","If you want to further strengthen your computer or internet security, look at our reviews of several other types of software, including computer protection software, encryption software and internet security suites software.","<strong>Hiding Your IP Address &amp; Keeping Internet Usage Private</strong>","While privacy software scrubs your computer clean of any information saved on your desktop, it doesn’t get rid of the tracks your IP address leaves across the internet.","Your computer interacts with the internet by sending and receiving information packets. This is how you receive emails, post updates or simply surf the web. IP stands for &#34;internet protocol.&#34; Your IP address is the identification number associated with your computer or device. It leaves tracks of your internet use so people know it was your computer that accessed specific sites or received certain data. Keep in mind that having an unprotected IP address isn’t always a bad thing, but it can be. According to <a href=\"https://blog.ip2location.com/knowledge-base/protect-yourself-from-ip-address-hacking/\">IP2Location</a>, hackers have used stolen IP addresses to “download illegal content like pirated material, child pornography, or content that threatens national security.” If someone steals your IP address, you could be accused of crimes you&#39;re completely unaware of. Further, hackers could even make it impossible for your computer to access the internet.","Most internet-enabled devices have their IP addresses assigned to them, so you cannot change them. Fortunately, you can protect your devices by hiding your IP address. Masking your IP address keeps your searches private. This is a useful way to keep ad services from tracking and targeting you as well as to keep your computer safe (well, safer) from malicious hackers and scams. To further protect yourself from hackers, never accept calls or messages online from people you don’t know.","A great way to protect your computer is to use a virtual private network (VPN). As IP2Location states, these programs make your IP address invisible by routing your online activity through a proxy server. Most VPN services are subscription based.
