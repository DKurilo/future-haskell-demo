Its body is Fein’s signature orange, including the handle. The lid, hose port and wheels are a contrasting black. The Turbo II is similar in build to other garage vacuums on the market, with a cylindrical shape. This model, however, has a little ledge out the back, which helps to stabilize the vacuum.","Unlike the typical four casters seen on most shop vac models, this wet/dry vac has six, yet another feature to stabilize it and aid in easy transportation.","Fein’s Turbo II is designed for hard labor around your garage. With a 9-gallon tub, you can use this orange-wonder on DIY projects or small construction sites. At a 9-gallon capacity, the wet/dry vac is specified as medium duty, which is ideal for any homeowner."]},"id":"0088128e-f35a-43b0-93f6-d04f26d74aa9","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/4UNUhovcqqzRitfTaZd6NK.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56541-fein-turbo-ii4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4UNUhovcqqzRitfTaZd6NK.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"4UNUhovcqqzRitfTaZd6NK","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4UNUhovcqqzRitfTaZd6NK.jpg","alt":""},"id":"58fe0458-6052-43e3-be8a-5814406195f8","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although it is built for bigger projects, you could surely use it inside as well, particularly thanks to the quiet operation at just 60dB. The provided crevice nozzle and round hand brush are great tools for vacuuming stairs and cleaning drapes and rugs.","This garage vacuum has a 19.7-foot power cord and a 16-foot hose. That is pretty extreme for a vacuum of this size. We are totally blown away by the distance that you can travel from the machine and still have powerful sucking abilities.","The Turbo II continues to impress with a built-in 19-amp socket outlet. You can plug your power tools right into the shop vac. It’s the perfect feature if you&#39;re out on a jobsite or busy in a garage that is lacking additional outlets.","The vacuum has a textile permanent filter, a filter cartridge and a paper-dust bag. The cartridge and paper-dust bag are for dry-vacuuming only.","The Turbo II is definitely impressive. We love its innovative and rugged design, the extremely long power cord and hose and the additional socket outlet.
