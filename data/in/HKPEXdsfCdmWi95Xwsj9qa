It belches out a staggering 34,000 BTUs between its six sealed burners. Notably, the two power burners reach high temperatures to boil water or fry bacon quickly, while the three sealed burners produce an average 8,500 BTUs for gentle simmering or melting delicate foods like chocolate.","The porcelain-coated platform grates run continuously to allow you to slide cookware from burner to burner without spilling or scratching the surface. While moving cookware across the cooktop, it&#39;s easy to spill and extinguish the pilot flame. The Dacor Classic has an electric re-igniter for uninterrupted cooking. The grates accommodate all sizes of cookware while still maintaining stability to hold multiple pots and pans at once. The SmartFlame feature reduces flame-to-grate contact to prevent discoloration or damage to the grate.","The bead-blasted finish creates a solid spill basin for easy, scratch-free cleaning. Gentle dish soaps and stainless steel cleaners work best for the Dacor Classic and similar gas cooktops. Available in two colors, the shiny stainless steel adds a sleek look to your kitchen, and the black option hides stains while maintaining a smooth neutral look."]},"id":"cb232327-a6e4-4ab8-95ec-81ec31b92b66","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/vrTvkrob4m4KYqpsjQaLDC.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Because the Dacor Classic is so large, you have to consider how much clearance space your kitchen has to fit this gas cooktop comfortably. Make sure you have at least 30 inches above, 2 inches in front and 7.5 inches to either side before you install. The manual recommends professional installation due to possible complications and dangers associated with using natural gas in any appliance. You&#39;ll get more peace of mind this way, and youâ€™ll be able to use the yearlong parts and labor warranty with professional installation. This cooktop is non-convertible and cannot run on liquid propane.
