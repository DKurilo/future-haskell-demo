It&#39;s also noticeably more energy efficient than many we compared.","When used with an electric water heater, this unit is designed to cost a mere $8 each year, well below average among the combos we compared. That number is even below average among the ones with the same 2-cubic-foot capacity, so ongoing costs will be low. Initial costs are pretty low, too, though there are cheaper ones to be found. The average price of machines we compared was $1,255 and the Haier HLC1700AXS is priced just under that at about $1,200. If you need a machine that is even more budget-friendly, check out the <a href=\"/magic-chef-review\">Magic Chef MCSCWD20W3</a>.","Generally, if you are in the market for a washer dryer combination, you are most concerned about saving space, so you are willing to accept the fact that you cannot do huge laundry loads. The HLC1700AXS is no exception with its 2 cubic feet of capacity. Generally, you need about 3.5 cubic feet of capacity to do large loads like a queen comforter. There are washer dryer combos that can accommodate loads like that but they may not fit in a small closet like the HLC1700AXS.","There are lots of ways to customize each load with the HLC1700AXS. The 11 wash cycles available include Quick, Delicates, Perm Press, Normal, Bulky, Heavy Duty and Whites. There were machines with more options, but this one has all the important cycle types, which also include Soak, Rinse &amp; Spin, Spin Only and Clean Washer.","You also have some control over the dryer portion of each load. The settings include More, Normal, Less and No heat. You can also use the plus and minus buttons to increase and decrease drying times in 10-minute increments.","Soil levels are much more adjustable than its competitors – some of which do not allow you to adjust them at all. With the Haier HLC1700AXS, you can indicate whether your load has Extra Light, Light, Normal, Heavy or Extra Heavy levels. That way you don&#39;t get more scrubbing than necessary, which can wear out fabrics over time. You also get lots of choice with water levels: Hot, Warm, Cool, Cold and Tap Cold. That way you can use the least amount of energy possible, only using warmed water when absolutely necessary.","All the settings are controlled with a dial and buttons. A digital display will offer a clear indication of how much time you have left in a cycle and about the other selections you have made for water temperature, spin speed, soil level and drying level.","You can decide when you want to run a load – up to 24 hours from the time you put in your clothing. That way you can set it to run toward the end of the day and come home from work to clean and dry clothing. The door automatically locks during a cycle, but there is also a child lock feature that will keep little hands from changing the settings.","This comes with a decent warranty. Parts and labor are covered for a year, which is normal. There is also one year of coverage on the motor, which is a short warranty period, and a little disappointing. There is a very respectable 7 years of coverage on the wash drum.","This unit is about average in terms of depth, height and width, so it will most likely meet your expectations for space savings. Even relatively small closets still offer 24 inches of depth. This would fit into those parameters.","The Haier HLC1700AXS is what you picture in a washer dryer combination unit – convenience in a very small package. There are units out there with more capacity, but they won&#39;t fit into smaller spaces like this one. There are units that cost less initially, but it is still below the median price in our comparison. The HLC1700AXS offers lots of ways to customize each load of laundry to your liking, and will save you loads of money over time with its excellent energy efficiency."]},"id":"c1729ce8-bf13-48d4-a13a-b6085c7e5dbd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70052","url":"/haier-hlc1700axs-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-06-27T13:05:12Z","datePublished":"2018-06-27T13:05:12Z","name":"Haier HLC1700AXS","synopsis":"The Haier HLC1700AXS offers what people are seeking in a washer dryer combination – compact convenience.
