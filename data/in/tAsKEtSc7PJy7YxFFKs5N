The Galaxy series is Android&#39;s flagship brand, but Samsung has rarely offered the best Android experience. Now, in the Galaxy S6, change has finally come. Samsung has eased up on TouchWiz, creating a variant of Android 5 that&#39;s not as severe a break from Google&#39;s stock operating system. Gone are the cheap plastic covers and faux leather stitching of devices past. They&#39;ve been replaced with Gorilla Glass, curved aluminum and a sturdy, chic hardiness.","The design echoes the <a href=\"/apple-iphone-review\">iPhone 6</a>, and that echo gives us pause. From a distance, the S6 is indistinguishable from the iPhone; up close, its biggest differentiators are the home button and camera bulge. Samsung has borrowed from Apple in the past, and in an industry already plagued by copycats, we&#39;d like to have seen more innovation in design.","But we can&#39;t deny the results. With features like a 577 PPI display and a 64-bit octa-core processor, the Galaxy S6&#39;s hardware is definitively Samsung and undeniably impressive. However unoriginal its aesthetics, this is the muscle car of the mobile world."]},"id":"f0533db7-8be1-4539-bb3c-77efafe9fe5f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"5aa8cd19-be77-4470-85e6-92444d481f6f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/DVirCHGFetqeUiXe3GQsG7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/64113-samsung-galaxy-s67.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DVirCHGFetqeUiXe3GQsG7.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"DVirCHGFetqeUiXe3GQsG7","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DVirCHGFetqeUiXe3GQsG7.jpg","alt":""},"id":"d4013f9a-36ca-49e5-85e5-a6174f691f00","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Galaxy line has been overdue for a design refresh, and the S6 brings with it a bevy of aesthetic changes.
