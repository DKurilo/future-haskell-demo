You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","For the money, the Sony SS-F7000 floor standing speakers may be the best deal around. They produce deep bass and exceptional treble. They’re excellent performers as part of a home theater surround sound system but do double duty as fine audio speakers for anyone who wants better music and presence than can be provided by tiny satellite or bookshelf speakers.

Typically, the deepest bass that people can hear is about 20Hz, or cycles per second, while the highest trebles reach or exceed 20,000Hz, or 20kHz. The Sony SS-F7000s cover among the broadest ranges we’ve encountered producing bass clear down to 35Hz and treble up to a rather amazing 50kHz.","To put that range of sound response in perspective, it’s helpful to review a few reference frequencies. The lowest note on a piano keyboard is an A which is produced by 27.5Hz. The low E of a bass guitar comes in at 41Hz. This means that the Sonys can produce just about all low bass musical information. True, getting to the absolute bottom of the sonic range will require the addition of a subwoofer, but their performance in this regard still exceeds that of most of the competition.","The story is the same on the treble side of the sound spectrum. The soprano voice can reach high C, two octaves above middle C. It’s the note that, whether realistic or of lore, is known to shatter a crystal goblet. As high as it sounds to us, it is produced by a mere 1046Hz. Much higher is the sound of cymbals with small ones creating tones around 15kHz.","Clearly, the SF-S7000 has no trouble producing the highest highs given its rated top frequency at 50kHz. Even though we can’t actually hear sounds that are much higher than 20kHz, the speakers&#39; ability to produce these ultrasonic tones is important to the overall effect of the music. Upper frequency overtones in that range can be perceived by the brain and add markedly to spatial quality and realism of the musical reproduction."]},"id":"a536ba9c-4a20-4a8e-b2c0-315d9838f56e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Peformance"},"id":"219111df-202f-4008-9e7c-a31ce8c06a7f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Speakers turn electrical impulses into sound by vibrating and creating pressure waves in the air that our ears can hear. Sensitivity represents the efficiency with which a speaker accomplishes the task. The Sony SS-F7000 has a rated sensitivity of 90dB, which is good among speakers generally but on the low side of speakers that have been included in our ratings.","The sensitivity of a speaker is important in two respects. First, it indicates how quiet it will be when it isn’t being driven by content. At 90dB, the Sonys will produce a nearly inaudible degree of hiss when idle. The other measure addresses how much sound is produced with a given amount of input. A 90dB speaker will not produce as much sound as a 93dB speaker with the same input. This point certainly addresses volume but much more importantly, it is an issue of musical clarity and precision. Audio components perform better when they’re not being pushed to their limit, so high efficiency equates to great clarity. The speaker has the capacity to handle up to 200W of input power."]},"id":"49920398-dd0b-407c-ad88-29971d2c14f0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Speaker Design"},"id":"f8a32106-3f29-4d6c-bed9-cd34a8392c11","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The highest sounds are produced in the SS-F7000s by a 1-inch Nano Fine Balanced dome tweeter.

One of them is designated as a cone woofer and the other a Mica reinforced subwoofer. In many multiple-woofer speakers with smaller bass drivers, each driver is fed exactly the same frequencies. In the case of this speaker, one is used to produce the lowest bass freeing the other to concentrate on the mid-bass tones."]},"id":"3d3ec4dd-1bf1-497c-8033-e2fa37dd843c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2e4cc0a6-d739-47a2-833e-b438db016c8d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Sony SS-F7000</strong> floor standing speakers produce a remarkably wide frequency response.
