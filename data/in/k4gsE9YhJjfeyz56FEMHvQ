You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The BlackBerry Z30 is the ailing company&#39;s most recent attempt to blaze its way into the modern <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> marketplace. With a bright 5-inch screen and a battery that will easily plow through your day, the phone both looks and feels the part. Fans of BlackBerry&#39;s operating system who have been waiting for a big-screen smartphone will be delighted. If you don&#39;t already count yourself among them, however, you may not find much here to entice you.","The Z30 is one of the heaviest phones you can buy. It&#39;s comfortable enough in short stints, but those 6 ounces become noticeable the longer you hold the phone. Enjoying movies and games is more tiresome than it would be on top smartphones from other companies, many of which have bigger screens, higher resolutions and faster internal components.","Having done away with the physical keyboard that has long been a staple of BlackBerry phones, the Z30 is a true touchscreen device. Its Super AMOLED technology keeps the screen vibrant and looking great, even under direct sunlight. Unfortunately, it&#39;s nowhere near as sharp as other phones you can buy. We only reviewed two phones with pixel densities under 300ppi, and BlackBerry made both of them. At 295ppi, the Z30&#39;s screen is still crisp, but it can&#39;t compare to the diamond-edged sharpness of displays on Samsung and HTC devices.","The camera built into the Z30 is adequate for shooting in daylight, but it struggles indoors. Images it creates are sharp and well saturated as long as the sun is out, but as night falls, edges can get fuzzy. And, like all BlackBerry phones, the camera lacks certain features such as a panorama mode and image filters – capabilities that are all but standard on the best smartphones from other companies.","The processor tucked inside the Z30 is the fastest ever used in a BlackBerry, so if you&#39;re switching from one of the company&#39;s other devices, you&#39;ll be impressed with the results. Next to other smartphones we&#39;ve reviewed, however, it remains average. The dual-core 1.7Ghz chip will play video and run basic games beautifully, but complex apps may be bogged down. Startup and shutdown times are also slow, consistently hitting the 1-minute mark. Thanks to instabilities in the operating system, you&#39;re more likely to crash on a BlackBerry than you are on a different phone, which means you&#39;ll be experiencing those slow startup times more often than you might expect."]},"id":"64e067ff-5dd8-4c9f-b2dd-511f350b6c48","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"52dbfbd1-8b28-462c-9a02-5bb5dbf6d6d7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Many BlackBerry enthusiasts in the world love the company&#39;s messaging-centric mentality, and have been waiting for a touchscreen phone with decent specs and a big display.
