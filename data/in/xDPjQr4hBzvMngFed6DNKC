When we received our test model, all we had to do was fill the oil tank, plug it in and pull the trigger. It started right up and we began using it immediately.

But if you’re primarily using it in a residential yard environment, that won’t be a problem.","<strong>Summary</strong><br/>The Craftsman 34120 is unremarkable – and this is a good thing. It’s a tool that does what it promises and does it well. It’s a breeze to setup, use, clean and store. It handles basic chainsaw tasks easily and without hassle. Of course, it doesn’t provide as much power as gas models, but if you’re an occasional or casual user, that’s a minor issue."]},"id":"bb7c2727-f655-4137-b22f-c533e17a2537","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70097","url":"/craftsman-34120-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
