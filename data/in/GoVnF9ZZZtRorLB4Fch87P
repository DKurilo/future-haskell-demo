This cappuccino maker uses 800 watts of power so that it will be ready to create your fresh brew in a matter of minutes â€“ much shorter than waiting in line at the local coffee house. By brewing espresso or cappuccino at home, you will also save more of your hard-earned money and have extra time to spend at home.","The steam wand of this cappuccino maker lets you froth milk and add a bit of latte art. Sprinkle cinnamon on top and you&#39;ll have some nice-looking, delicious cups of coffee ready to impress your friends. All of the espresso makers in the Imusa GAU series can brew up to 4 cups at a time in the included glass carafe.","This good espresso maker comes with a removable drip tray. This helps you clean the drip tray without much effort. This also makes it easy to wash the drip tray itself. Just remove it, toss it into a sink of soapy water and wipe away the coffee residue.","The Imusa GAU-18200 comes with a dishwasher-safe carafe. When you are finished with your tasty beverage in the morning, you can simply place the carafe into the dishwasher for cleaning. This will cut down on the time you spend at your sink trying to scrub the carafe clean. It will also sanitize your carafe.","This device is missing is a removable water reservoir, but it&#39;s only a small hassle to fill the attached reservoir using the machine&#39;s carafe. Also, because you will need to use the carafe to fill the reservoir, you will get a perfect amount of water into this appliance for each cup of espresso. The GAU also does not come with a measuring tool or a tamping tool. You can pick these up separately for a small cost."]},"id":"980d546b-5d09-44b1-8f76-3f2af3ae16e3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"99aeb42b-a43f-4428-8245-7b4857c87ec4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Imusa GAU-18200 espresso maker comes with a list of features that will keep you coming back time and time again for that perfect cup.
