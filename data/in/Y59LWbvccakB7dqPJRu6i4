You&#39;ll need to consider dimensions, how much you&#39;re willing to pay and how quickly your display will come.","<strong>Dimensions</strong><br/>Always start by sketching out the display space itself and determining how much you&#39;ll need to allocate for your graphics in addition to space for tables and chairs, podiums, media displays and more. If it&#39;s a smaller show, perhaps a tabletop pull-up graphic will suffice. For larger shows, determine if you will need additional lighting, one or two podiums with or without graphics, racks or stands for brochures and sales materials, or even an additional sandwich board to highlight a different aspect of your company. If you know your booth will be viewable from the back, look for options that include double-sided graphics.","<strong>Budget</strong><br/>Trade show displays come in a range of sizes and styles. Smaller graphics and pull-up signs, which can cost a few hundred dollars, are easier to transport and add color and pop to your display area. Booths with detailed trusses and larger graphics can run in the thousands. The larger the booth, the more it will cost to transport and store. If you do not have a design staff or a designer in house, calculate the cost of hiring a designer to help you complete your graphics. Often, trade show booth companies will provide in-house creative services, including graphic design. Look for a flexible service provider who can accommodate your specific needs.","<strong>Turnaround Time</strong><br/>Before you order, check the turnaround time from the manufacturer. If you know your team is likely to change its collective mind more than once, inquire ahead of time about setup fees and change orders. All manufacturers should be clear about their turnaround times. In this era of large-scale printing, it shouldn&#39;t take more than five business days for your booth to ship. Some companies will provide physical proofs in additional to an emailed proof. Ensure that if you would like to take advantage of that option, you know how much that will add to your production schedule. If you are in a pinch, many manufacturers will charge a rush fee to cut that turnaround time down to two, or even one, business day.","Trade shows and industry conferences can be the make-or-break event for the year. The right booth can make all the difference for your company&#39;s success.","<strong>Ace Exhibits Exhibitor 10&#39; Package Review</strong>","Ace Exhibits offers a host of complete trade show displays and accessories. Like most printers in this era, they are selling the convenience of a service as well as the materials. They provide a full suite of design support and have a range of add-ons that can all be sourced directly from their website for your convenience.","The Exhibitor 10-foot Trade Show Package will satisfy a lot of needs for a 10 x 10-foot exhibitor space. The package includes a 10-foot aluminum frame in black or silver, a complete podium with storage in back, wrap graphics for both the podium and the frame, and 10 square feet worth of wood-like locking tiles that can be used to cover the floor space. All of this can be contained in the included carrying case that is converted into the podium when assembled. If needed, the company has additional accessories for the booth such as overhead LED lighting that can be attached to the frame. The display material is made of laminate titanium film and the graphic wrapper for the podium is constructed of specialized vinyl.","One big bonus that Ace offers is no rush fee. If an order is approved by noon Pacific, the order ships the next day. Any order approved after the cutoff will be shipped in two business days. This is certainly a huge convenience if you need any new graphics down the line or if you&#39;re working on a time crunch. They offer hourly design services at a standard industry rate. All of the materials include a limited lifetime warranty.","This is certainly a complete kit in terms of basic trade show displays. Depending upon your budget, you may be able to get away with a kit that does not involve the additional cost of the flooring. Also, if you&#39;re a road warrior traveling solo to set up your show, note that the kit itself can be heavy to cart around. The flooring alone weighs 65 pounds. Ace will drop ship to any location, so it may not be an issue for the trade show display&#39;s first deployment. This is a standard banner design, so replacement graphics should arrive quickly. Also, Ace has a complete list of small replacement materials for all of its frames and accessories for maintenance down the line.","Overall, the convenience of having a kit like this all in one will be appealing to a busy marketer who needs quick and convenient service. The company has a positive track record for customer service, and the rapid turnaround time could save you rush charge fees.","<a href=\"#Back_to_Top\">Back to Top</a>","<strong>Aero 1200 Review</strong>"]},"id":"a32ad955-2888-4690-be2a-f2b7653af7c0","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/8rXHzSi3KU4a6QTbDxTbp6.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Trade show displays have become quite standardized with the proliferation of large-scale printing.

The height is adjustable, allowing you to select quarter-height, half-height or full-height graphics for one, two or all three of the panels. The banners retract into the top pole to make setup even quicker. Because the graphics pull down and hook into the base, this may be a simpler setup than Velcro or even magnetic panels.

The assembled dimensions of the booth are 10 x 8 feet. With a depth of just over 2 feet, or 27 inches, it is shallow enough to sit at the back of at 10 x 10 exhibit space and allow room for mingling or other display objects. All of the graphics and printing costs for the back wall is included. Also included are two side-mounted tabletops, two lights, a canopy, fiberglass wings and header with printing, and two shipping cases. The tables have an option of four different laminate finishes.","The booth hardware is covered by a full five-year manufacturer&#39;s warranty against defects. The shipping weight is 145 pounds, making it relatively light for a booth of this size and design style. The site provides a shipping calculator to determine your final shipping costs. While it is not as quick to put together as a simple pop up trade show display booth, it does come with a full set of hardware and assembly instructions.","The company also provides a full suite of additional services, including graphic design and rush services if needed. If you wish to get printing on the header and wings, an additional fee will be assessed. Additional monitor mounts, printing on the header only and an upgrade to LED lighting are also available. Finishes for the lighting include black and chrome.","If you have an in-house design staff, Illustrator and Photoshop templates are available for download. Designs must be submitted via FTP instead of a direct upload. With an investment of this nature, it is recommended that you contact the vendor prior to purchase. One of the downsides of the online ordering process is that there are no sample images of how the wings and cover look with printed graphics. It&#39;s unclear if fabric proofs are available. The site mentions that a fabric canopy is included, but further details and images are not provided. If you have a specific deadline, inquire directly as to turn around times for this booth. Graphics require a five-day turnaround. Note that assembling and moving this booth may be job for more than one person. Ensure that you have ample time for setup onsite.","This is a professional trade show display that includes a complete graphics and accessories package. It is large and may be hard to set up if you&#39;re solo. It&#39;s recommended to discuss this product with a sales specialist prior to ordering.","<a href=\"#Back_to_Top\">Back to Top</a>"]},"id":"46f86425-f07f-43b6-8c53-bd2dcad8050e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10262","url":"/best-trade-show-displays-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-11-21T15:54:15Z","datePublished":"2016-11-21T15:54:15Z","name":"Best Trade Show Displays Review","synopsis":"Many marketing professionals can recall an era where trade show displays were large, bulky and expensive to set up.","review":{},"strapline":"Many marketing professionals can recall an era where trade show displays were large, bulky and expensive to set up.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-11-21T16:17:25Z","id":"Y59LWbvccakB7dqPJRu6i4","meta":{"title":"Best Trade Show Displays Review","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
