The company now has manufacturing locations in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. There are also reseller locations in 34 countries around the world.","Voxeljet sells 3D printers and offers <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/3d-printing-services,review-2323.html\">3D printing services</a>. The company also offers assistance to help you create custom 3D printing designs. Well-known auto manufacturers as well as many other industrial sectors use Voxeljet for 3D printing services.","Voxeljet provides 3D printing services in either sand or plastic. There are two types of plastic to choose from, and the one that works for your project is based on how much detail and resolution you require in the final piece.","If you choose a sand casting, you can pick what size quartz sand particle will work for the geometry of your design. A very complex design might require temperature-resistant sand called kerphalite. Polyurethane seals a sand casting to create a smooth, non-porous surface. Sand castings are typically used for ceramic, plaster or gypsum molds.","Plastic models are great for light metals, steel or iron molds. Finishing materials are available if you want your design to be a certain color or have a specific texture. Hot or cold wax and epoxy are three options that add a different surface treatment to your plastic molds. Epoxy is particularly useful to add strength to a delicate design.","The 3D printers that Voxeljet operates can produce almost any number of parts based on your CAD dataset. The largest machine, the VX4000, can produce a sand model that is 4000 x 2000 x 1000 mm. In plastic form, the largest mold possible is 1000 mm x 600 x 500 mm. There are only a few 3D printing companies capable of producing such large molds. You can also combine parts to create a model of almost any size.","Voxeljet can ship anywhere in the world. The production time varies by the complexity and size of the design, but most molds and castings take a few business days to complete. There are almost no limits to what you can have this company design. On the Voxeljet website, you can view case studies that vary from a silver pipe to a model of the human spine. If you are looking for an experienced 3D printing company that has global reach, Voxeljet is a great option to consider."]},"id":"5f83a826-58de-4104-a95c-7bc259df7c8e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66928","url":"/voxeljet-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-16T15:54:02Z","datePublished":"2015-09-16T15:54:02Z","name":"Voxeljet","synopsis":"Voxeljet is one of the biggest 3D printing companies in Europe; it was founded in 1999 in Munich, Germany.
