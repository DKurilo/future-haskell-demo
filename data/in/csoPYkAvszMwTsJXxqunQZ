These binoculars are lightweight, and they&#39;re also waterproof and fogproof, so they can handle wet conditions without damage to the optics inside. They&#39;re some of the lowest-powered binoculars we reviewed, with a magnification that makes them best for outdoor activities or watching sports.","During the testing process, we conducted a survey in which participants rated each pair of binoculars on its optical quality. Most of the participants thought the Leupold BX-1 Yosemite produced crisp, clear images, but some felt they were fuzzy around the edges.","The Leupold BX-1 Yosemite has 8x magnification, meaning objects appear eight times closer than they would without the binoculars. This magnification, combined with a wide field of view at 118 meters, would make these the best binoculars for birdwatching or sporting events. However, it&#39;s difficult to adjust the focus.","With the central focusing knob, you can focus both lenses in the Leupold BX-1 Yosemite at the same time. This allows you to quickly adjust the binoculars, instead of trying to focus each eyepiece individually. Even with these elements, participants in our survey said the binoculars were hard to focus.","At 17 ounces, the Leupold BX-1 Yosemite is one of the lightest pairs of binoculars we reviewed. This makes it great for kids, as they can hold it up for longer without needing a break. But one drawback is that you can&#39;t use these binoculars with a tripod to provide more relief for small arms.","Like all the binoculars we reviewed, the Leupold BX-1 Yosemite has rubber armor to prevent excessive damage when it gets dropped or bumped. It&#39;s also waterproof and fogproof, so you can use it outdoors, even if it&#39;s raining, without water or condensation damaging the optics.","Like all binocular manufacturers, Leupold offers a limited lifetime warranty. The company covers repairs or product replacements required because of defective components, but not damage caused by normal wear and tear.","In case you have some questions, the company offers a FAQs page on its website for answers to common questions, like which are the best Leupold binoculars for children. You can also contact the company by phone or email if you have a specific question not answered in the FAQs. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no live chat, so you won&#39;t be able to get some quick questions answered while you&#39;re on the website."]},"id":"2b8a5eaf-3d9c-426d-bd40-d6f743df48c2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"41958466-c66d-4c2c-bdf5-544ebb7ca67b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Leupold BX-1 Yosemite is a good set of binoculars for kids because of its weight, durable design and ease of use.
