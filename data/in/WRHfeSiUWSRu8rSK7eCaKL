You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Wolf DO30U/S is one of the largest <a href=\"/best-electric-wall-double-ovens\">double ovens</a> on the market. Each of its ovens has a capacity of 4.5 cubic feet, which is nearly as large as a conventional single oven. The large capacity and even larger price tag of this Wolf appliance narrows its pool of potential buyers. However, if money and space are no question, this double oven isn’t likely to disappoint.","Each oven on this Wolf appliance measures 30 inches wide. Its massive size means it will take up more space in your kitchen, but you can cook two full-size dishes (think two Thanksgiving turkeys) at the same time.","A unique feature of this double wall oven is its hidden controls. The controls are hidden behind a stainless steel panel that quietly rotates into position with the touch of a button. This lends the oven a unique and clean look that blends well with minimal and modern kitchens.","If you are a seasoned cook, you will no doubt appreciate this double oven’s 10 cooking modes and dual convection system. These features enable this Wolf oven to cook superbly, and its performance far outshines cheaper, entry-level ovens. The convection system has two fans and four heating elements designed to maximize airflow in the cooking chambers to provide even and consistent temperatures. Two of the cooking modes, bake stone and dehydrate, require accessories that must be purchased separately.","Similar to most double ovens, this one also has a self-cleaning feature, delayed start and a Sabbath mode. The self-cleaning feature helps keep the oven clean without any vigorous cleaning on your part and delayed start means you can delay the cook time on either oven. The Sabbath mode means this oven is Kosher certified and holiday compliant. Each oven also has three adjustable racks. You can adjust the racks as needed so you can easily fit pans and baking dishes of various sizes in both dishes.","The Wolf DO30U/S clearly isn’t for everyone. It is just too expensive to tempt most consumers. However, customers say the oven boasts second-to-none cooking performance and if it will fit in your kitchen, this Wolf double oven will exceed your expectations."," "]},"id":"3286cd55-c173-49f4-ad34-83eb5df44923","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59361","url":"/wolf-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-17T22:29:15Z","datePublished":"2014-04-17T22:29:15Z","name":"Wolf DO30U/S","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-04-17T22:29:15Z","id":"WRHfeSiUWSRu8rSK7eCaKL","meta":{"title":"Wolf DO30U/S Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"With a large capacity and high price tag, the Wolf DO30U/S is not a good fit for everyone.
