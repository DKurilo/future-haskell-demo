You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Sirius Sonic Skin Care System is a tool to be added to  your regular face cleansing routine. It pairs with your favorite  cleanser for a deeper clean than you might otherwise  get using just your fingers or cotton pads, according to the manufacturer. The device works by using sonic vibrations that pulse the bristles against your skin, removing unwanted dirt and oil from your pores.","Sirius includes five different brush heads with its electric face brush. Each head attachment serves a different purpose and role in your routine. The first two pieces are the brush heads for normal or sensitive skin. You use the one that suits  your skin best. The remaining three attachments, the exfoliation applicator, hydration applicator and toning attachment, work with different types of astringents. If you use a lot of different skincare products, this <a href=\"/best-facial-cleansing-brushes\">facial cleansing brush</a> has an attachment for each type of face wash, toner or exfoliant that you use.","Replacement heads are available through Sirius for an additional cost. The company recommends changing the brush head every three or four months of daily use, because the bristles  begin to lose their effectiveness. However, you can extend the life of your attachment pieces by cleaning them after each use. Replacements come in packages of two for a low cost.","The device does not have a control to adjust the speed of the vibrating brush head. The sonic movements made by this face cleansing brush work through slight vibrations instead of heavier scrubbing. Thus, the device does not require higher speed settings. However, if you have particularly troublesome skin and want a more vigorous scrubber, you may want to look at other models  with faster oscillation.","The Sirius Sonic Skin Care System requires two AA batteries. Your first two batteries are included in the box. Using the electric face brush on a daily basis, even for just a minute or two, may result in you having to change the batteries frequently. The device is waterproof, however, if you use it in while you shower, moisture can get inside the battery case and cause the batteries to corrode.  This does not damage the device, but it  causes the batteries to stop working prematurely. If you&#39;d prefer a brush that you can use in the shower, you might want to consider <a href=\"/essential-skin-solutions-review\">Essential Skin Solutions</a>. The Sirius Sonic comes with a plastic cradle to hold  the device  when it is not in use.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"33b4b458-b3b8-49af-a910-14dc30b84770","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_65101","url":"/sirius-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-26T21:54:31Z","datePublished":"2015-05-26T21:54:31Z","name":"Sirius Sonic","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","id":"QYWZWoWfH6zDjk8DPVfJ2Q","meta":{"title":"Sirius Sonic Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Sirius Sonic Skin Care System uses rapid pulsing movements  to cleanse your skin&#039;s  surface of dirt and oils.
