A 1-second trigger speed means you&#39;ll be able to capture animals mid-frame as they move past the camera. The recovery time of 15 seconds is crippling, however, especially considering this camera does not have a multi-shot mode. It&#39;s possible that an animal would walk into the camera&#39;s detection zone; the camera would take a picture, and then still be recovering while the animals walked out of the detection zone. Trail cams with a quicker recovery time or a multi-shot mode would have taken 2 or 3 pictures in that time.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/59814-micro-crush-101.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zY9RojPmLf7DScZV8Vw34.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"6zY9RojPmLf7DScZV8Vw34","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zY9RojPmLf7DScZV8Vw34.jpg","alt":""},"id":"1304673b-37de-4643-b2d0-01eae2aac308","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["A 60-foot detection range is strong and means even far-away movements will trigger the camera. However, its detection angle is only 35 degrees.

It also features a time-lapse mode that is useful for tracking wildlife-movement patterns on your property.","We interacted with the customer service team of each game camera we reviewed, and the Wildgame Innovation customer service representatives were the most frustrating to deal with. Their knowledge of trail cameras was poor, and they were unable to transfer us to someone more knowledgeable.","This weak phone support, coupled with a complete lack of email support, results in us having reservations about the quality of support you&#39;ll receive after purchasing a Wildgame Innovations trail camera.
