It runs on a rechargeable battery, so it remains operational even during power outages.","Most stairlifts can swivel at the top and end of their rails, but the Flow II can swivel anywhere along its rail and during a ride. This nifty feature makes it easy to use on narrow stairways, spiral and multi-flight staircases. The chair folds neatly, and triggering the folding mechanism requires little exertion from you; you simply depress the footrest and it folds itself.","The seat height is adjustable to five different positions according to your preference. This seat is sturdy enough to carry a maximum weight of 275 pounds, which is average for a curved stairlift, though not enough for some users.","The Flow II easily adapts to steep stairways with an angle of inclination that reaches 70 degrees. It uses a rack-and-pinion drive system, has a top speed of 0.5 feet per second, and is powered by a 350-watt motor that runs on two 12-volt batteries. Should the battery level get too low, there is an emergency lowering system that returns the stairlift to the bottom of the stairs in order to ensure it does not block the stairway.","Besides a seat belt to secure you in during rides, the Flow II also has other safety mechanisms built in. For instance, its emergency brakes are most useful for steep stairs, while sensors around its edge prevent it from running into obstacles while in motion.","There are two rail options for this handicap stairlift. The single-rail option allows you to install the unit on either side of the staircase, while you would choose the drop-nose rail option when there is an obstruction at the bottom of the stairs or directly in the stairlift&#39;s path. Although the drop-nose option takes up more space than the single rail, it only requires 7 inches of space from the first step of the staircase.","In both options, the rail has an extruded aluminum profile and a powder-coated finish. While this finish looks nice after installation, it has a tendency to peel and leave powdered paint residue along the staircase.","The Flow II is a full-featured, aesthetically pleasant and comfortable curved stairlift. Its patented swivel system makes it very adaptable to an array of curved stairs, but it can also be costly to repair. Its reliance on powered systems means that it needs frequent recharging."]},"id":"402a3dc4-46d4-46b2-b312-04c879eb0018","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61357","url":"/thyssenkrupp-access-flow-ii-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"sheryl-huggins-salomon","url":"/author/sheryl-huggins-salomon","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Sheryl Huggins Salomon","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"PEDnkfQBmpWyHpYTiEznSY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-02T19:52:49Z","datePublished":"2014-12-02T19:52:49Z","name":"ThyssenKrupp Access Flow II","synopsis":"The Flow II is a curved stairlift from ThyssenKrupp Access.
