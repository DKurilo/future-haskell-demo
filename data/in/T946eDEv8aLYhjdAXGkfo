Having a well-stocked studio is essential no matter what your preferred medium is, however. Even an artist who works in a very specific medium often finds that he or she needs <a href=\"/\">art supplies</a> that involve other media. Sketch artists could benefit from keeping some paint on hand, while digital artists can definitely appreciate the convenience of good old-fashioned pencil and paper. Here are some ideas for basic items that every artist should keep in his or her studio.","<strong>Desk</strong>. This one almost goes without saying, but a good table, desk or other writing surface is perhaps the most essential item your studio needs. If you are primarily a sketch artist, a drafting desk is probably ideal, while an easel is a better option for painters. Artists who work on computers will need student- or office-style desks.","<strong>Proper lighting</strong>. Good lighting is almost as essential as a proper desk or work surface, if not more so. Natural light is always best, but when a window-filled studio isn&#39;t available (or for those who prefer to work at night), a mixture of overhead lighting and movable floor and desk lamps will do. Many artists will also want to invest in a lightbox for tracing and redrawing purposes.","<strong>A small, posable mannequin</strong>. The 9.5- or 12-inch wooden figure model is a standard item for artists of all types. For more detailed work, consider also a posable wooden hand."]},"id":"147ceea7-c25c-4597-a3ce-d6908787f33a","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Erasers</strong>. There&#39;s not much you can do if you make a mistake when drawing in ink, but pencils can be corrected with a quick flick of an eraser. But not all erasers are created equal; art gum erasers are a standard because they erase cleanly, without damaging the paper or leaving smudges. Rubber, plastic and moldable erasers also are useful, and each will produce a slightly different effect.","<strong>Paint and brushes</strong>. Whether you prefer watercolor, oil paint or acrylic, paint is essential to any art studio. A variety of brush styles, shapes and materials will greatly affect your final product. Stock up on a diverse selection so that you can paint however the mood strikes you.","<strong>Canvas and paper</strong>. Different weights of paper will provide different results, so keep a wide variety of paper stocks on hand, from tracing paper to heavy card stock. Canvases are available in a wide range of sizes but typically don&#39;t vary much in texture, so keep the sizes that work for you in stock.","<strong>Modeling clay</strong>. Even if you don&#39;t intend to work in clay as a primary medium, modeling clay can be a useful brainstorming tool. Plus, it&#39;s just fun to play with when you have some downtime or are stuck in the middle of a project.","<strong>Charcoal and pastels</strong>. These two drawing materials are pretty basic for most sketch artists, but they can be useful to doodle with for other artists. The unique textures they provide can help spark inspiration and creativity in other media too.","<strong>Camera, computer and scanner</strong>. These tools are great for saving your work. A scanner is ideal for transferring small works to your computer, and a camera works well for large and three-dimensional pieces. On the computer, you can simply view your work later, or you can edit it further for a product that mixes traditional and digital media.","Of course, these items are just the basics. Your art studio should be a reflection of you and your unique style, interests and creative process. But with these ten essentials in your studio, you&#39;ll be well equipped to start working creatively whenever inspiration strikes.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don&#39;t Have To. "]},"id":"9363a2ad-7803-4598-adce-243763f09660","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7629","url":"/outfitting-an-art-studio-ten-must-have-items","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"emma-frankart","url":"/author/emma-frankart","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Emma Frankart","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"zVWTySTL7AawdeV5XqSbMb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-10-22T15:51:20Z","datePublished":"2012-10-22T15:51:20Z","name":"Outfitting an Art Studio: Ten Must-Have Items","synopsis":"Every artist works differently.
