Comparable in most other ways, the main differences between this <a href=\"/best-treadmills\">treadmill</a> and the <a href=\"/proform-review\">SMART Pro 5000</a> are the size of its screen and number of preprogrammed workouts. The SMART Pro 9000’s 10-inch HD touchscreen display is three inches bigger than the SMART Pro 5000’s seven-inch screen, and the SMART Pro 9000 has two more onboard workouts. While these may seem like rather small differences, they add more than you might think to the SMART Pro 9000’s price. This machine costs several hundred dollars more than the SMART Pro 5000, even when it’s on sale.","The SMART Pro 9000’s 4.0 continuous-drive horsepower Mach Z Commercial Plus Motor is a quiet, efficient motor with an electromagnetic direct current drive. The motor is designed to work hard without overheating, and it can handle intense, frequent use. Like most of the treadmills we reviewed, this one has a 22-inch by 60-inch running deck with a maintenance-free tread belt. The belts of the <a href=\"/horizon-elite-t7-02-review\">Horizon Elite T7-02</a> and the <a href=\"/precor-review\">Precor TRM 223</a> in our lineup are just 20 inches wide, which can make them slightly less comfortable for users who may need more elbow room.","The dimensions of the SMART Pro 9000 are 77.16 x 39.15 x 70 inches (length, width and height), and the deck is foldable for efficient storage. This machine weighs 320 pounds and can accommodate a maximum user weight of 300 pounds. ProForm calls the SMART Pro 9000’s deck cushioning “ProShox” and says it minimizes stress on the hips, ankles, knees and feet using an air compression chamber. For athletes like Mikaelle Giffin, this kind of shock absorption is important, especially when you’re running hard.","“I have picky feet,” she said, “and treadmills can be harsh on your feet.”","Another feature Giffin pays attention to is a treadmill’s incline and decline, and she likes to be able to easily control her workout speed.","“This makes it nice for sprint training,” she said, “but the machine also has to be sturdy.”","The SMART Pro 9000 has balanced 2.5-inch rollers and is built to be stable and long-lasting. It has a 15 percent incline and a 3 percent decline, with easy electronic adjustability. According to ProForm, adding the negative grade makes your workouts more targeted, helps you burn more calories and can give you a “complete real-world experience.”","The technology integrated in the SMART Pro 9000 also makes working out more realistic. Like the SMART Pro 5000, the <a href=\"/nordictrack-commercial-review\">NordicTrack Commercial 1750</a> and the <a href=\"/nordictrack-commercial-2950-review\">NordicTrack Commercial 2950</a>, this treadmill comes with a one-year subscription to iFit, complete with studio and location-based workouts that add challenge and motivation to your routine. There are also 40 professional training programs onboard, along with two EKG hand-grip sensors and a wireless chest strap. As you work to achieve your fitness goals, you can track your progress from the console and tweet your successes right from the touchscreen. Like most treadmills we reviewed, this machine has a maximum workout speed of 12 mph.","ProForm guarantees the SMART Pro 9000 with a lifetime warranty on its frame and motor, five years on parts and two years on labor. Customer service is available by phone and live chat."]},"id":"cc9a4741-4a77-47b7-8d19-0540a6c99a00","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70012","url":"/proform-smart-pro-9000-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-06-04T19:49:02Z","datePublished":"2018-06-04T19:49:02Z","name":"ProForm SMART Pro 9000","synopsis":"The ProForm SMART Pro 9000 is the leader of the brand’s Pro Series pack.","review":{"rating":84,"verdict":"The ProForm SMART Pro 9000 is an impressive home treadmill with a large HD touchscreen and a quiet, high-performance motor.
