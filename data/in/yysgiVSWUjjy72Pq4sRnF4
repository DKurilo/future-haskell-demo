You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Panasonic CY-RC50KU bills itself as a <a href=\"/home/auto/best-backup-camera\">rear view camera</a>, and it is. That is all it is. The only object you will find in the box is the camera itself. There are no cables, no monitor, no wireless transmitter, no mounting gear – just the camera. Which begs the question, what are you supposed to do with it?","If you buy this unit, you&#39;d better have a plan for how you&#39;re going to mount it on your vehicle and connect it to a monitor, among various other tasks required to make this unit perform its assigned functions. If you&#39;re not electronically or mechanically minded, it&#39;s going to be a challenge if you buy this unit.","In addition to purchasing the camera itself (it&#39;s not exactly cheap), you will also be required to buy a monitor. Those can run anywhere from $50 to a couple hundred dollars. Furthermore, you will need to buy cable to connect the camera to your new monitor. Then, you&#39;ll have to determine how these cables fit into your vehicle. It&#39;s a complicated process, and if you don&#39;t have a plan or don&#39;t possess the knowledge to do it correctly, it has the potential to do serious damage to the electrical system of your car.","All that aside, the camera itself is a high-quality product. The images produced by the cameras arrive on your third-party monitor in a respectable 500 x 500 resolution. This is on par with many of the other rear view cameras on our side-by-side comparison chart. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio of the Panasonic CY-RC50KU is a healthy 46dB. This means that static and visual artifacts are at an absolute minimum.","The viewing angle of the Panasonic CY-RC50KU is a moderately wide 134 degrees. This statistic sits dead center among the other rear view cameras on our lineup. Another stat that lands right in the average zone is the camera&#39;s focal length, at 1.94mm. Neither of these numbers is bad, but they&#39;re not stellar, and they don&#39;t help this rear view camera stand out in our head-to-head comparison of these products.","One element of the Panasonic CY-RC50KU that is superior to some of its competition is the sensor Panasonic installs on the unit. The sensor measures one quarter of an inch. This allows the rear view camera to capture a crisp, clear picture. When you connect the camera to your car and then to a monitor, you can expect to see high-quality images displayed. Just make sure you buy a display that&#39;s capable of displaying the images at their full resolution.","To its credit, Panasonic provides plenty of help and support options for the Panasonic CY-RC50KU. You have the ability to pick up the phone or send an email with a question or concern and get a timely support. The product also comes with a one-year warranty."]},"id":"5d47fc4b-8114-4d36-a902-c9a78f6be02d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"659d0240-201a-41e3-bf3b-63c1d8bddf0a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Panasonic CY-RC50KU</strong> is not a bad rear view camera.
