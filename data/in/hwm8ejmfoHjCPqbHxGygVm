The side-by-side refrigerator has many features that are superior to both our second-ranked product, the KitchenAid bottom-freezer refrigerator, and the third-ranked Maytag refrigerator freezer. The Whirlpool Latitude has better-quality components, more storage customization options, a superior icemaker with portable ice bin and a programmable water dispenser.","Whirlpool Corporation is the world&#39;s largest home appliance maker. Brands manufactured by Whirlpool include Maytag, Amana, KitchenAid, Roper and more. Across all of its various brands, Whirlpool consistently demonstrates a commitment to quality, functionality, workmanship and style. The company is an industry leader in the innovation and design of home appliances. The Whirlpool Latitude French door refrigerator with bottom-mount freezer is one of these cutting-edge appliances.","The beautiful design of the Whirlpool Latitude French door refrigerator can make it the centerpiece of most kitchens. The Whirlpool has an attractive, scratch-resistant finish that is easy to clean and maintain. The bottom-freezer refrigerator is available in four colors: monochromatic satina, white-on-white, black and monochromatic stainless steel. Coupled with its eye-catching exterior, the Whirlpool Latitude refrigerator freezer has a total storage capacity of 25.9 cubic feet. This ample space makes the bottom-freezer refrigerator a versatile food storage system."]},"id":"af11a30d-bb19-4a4f-9bdd-a043f67b9cf9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Capacity &amp; Efficiency"},"id":"6dd1c4e3-8c12-4792-adab-3fec8579f962","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool Latitude French door refrigerator is Energy Star qualified. The estimated yearly cost to operate the refrigerator freezer is a mere $59.00. Moreover, the total estimated annual energy consumption is 555kWh. Clearly, budget-conscious consumers will reap financial savings with the Whirlpool Latitude bottom-freezer refrigerator. The refrigerator freezer&#39;s energy efficiency can also contribute towards the global initiative of decreasing greenhouse emissions.","Whirlpool backs the French door refrigerator with a limited one-year warranty as long as the owner of the side-by-side refrigerator maintains and operates it according to the instructions enclosed with the user manual. Within this first year of ownership, Whirlpool will pay for all needed replacement parts and labor to correct flaws in materials and design."]},"id":"c1ed98de-72cc-4e21-b1de-b60598c86cf3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"eff96306-a0ce-4b75-811d-dcea8f4a130b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With a 19.7-cubic-feet refrigeration compartment, the Whirlpool Latitude French door refrigerator is abundant with organization options. The doors of the side-by-side refrigerator open with ease. A unique feature of this bottom-freezer refrigerator is that the doors can open together or separately. In most side-by-side refrigerators, only the right door can open alone; in other models, opening the left-side door requires opening the right-side door first.","The technology behind the doors is creative. The left door of the side-by-side refrigerator is equipped with an interior vertically hinged seal. Upon opening, the seal automatically falls inward and does not interfere with the storage or retrieval of food items. Shutting both doors causes the hinged-seal to return to its original position. Once in position, the vertical-hinge seals both doors of the French door refrigerator simultaneously. This inventive engineering helps the refrigerator freezer keep food fresh longer.","The interior refrigeration compartment has four adjustable, slide-out, spill-proof glass shelves. A half-shelf adjusts to accommodate taller items like wine bottles or a thermos. Spill-proofing prevents liquids from leaking onto the shelves and compartments below. All of these features combine to provide easy cleanup as well as easy access to food stored at the back of the refrigerator.","The refrigeration compartment has a full-width pantry that has generous room for party platters. The pantry can also store large amounts of fresh meat, deli meats, cheeses and more. The bottom-freezer refrigerator has two crisper drawers that have independent humidity controls. The drawers preserve the crispness and taste of fresh fruit and vegetables."]},"id":"6394e654-0076-41d0-8e34-b7027eeee814","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Refrigerator Storage &amp; Controls"},"id":"f6e573b3-9d08-4eee-bc27-da0524c65083","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The side-by-side refrigerator has four deep in-the-door bins for storing salad dressings, condiments and other small containers.
