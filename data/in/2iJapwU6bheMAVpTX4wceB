As one reviewer sat in a room with the sound machine running, another reviewer outside of the room created noises by turning on a vacuum, TV, stereo and blender. The sound spa struggled to mask the intrusive sound of a vacuum cleaner as it turned on. Also, the white noise maker didn&#39;t succeed at fully masking the street traffic outside of our testing facility, a feat that the <a href=\"/electronics/family/best-sound-machines/lectro-fan-review/\">Lectro Fan</a> and <a href=\"/electronics/family/best-sound-machines/homedics-deep-sleep-review/\">HoMedics Deep Sleep</a> were able to accomplish.
