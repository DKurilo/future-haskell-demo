You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","One of the most trusted names in <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TVs</a> is LG. LG has built a reputation of producing quality TVs that are gorgeous in picture quality. The LN5700 55-inch LED TV is part of LG’s smart TV line as well. This means you have access to web browsing from your TV.","In side-by-side comparisons, LG’s display performed well in color accuracy, especially when compared to entry-level TVs. This LG has an average refresh rate, which should be adequate for most fast action scenes. LG touts a 5,000,000-to-1 contrast ratio, which seems high but doesn’t mean much because contrast ratio tests vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. However, in our side-by-side test, the black level and contrast test were only average.","This device offers competitive features. This LG has smart TV functionality that includes full web browsing and apps like Netflix and Hulu Plus. With built-in Wi-Fi, you can connect this TV to the internet wirelessly or through an Ethernet port. It also features near-field communication (NFC) technology, which allows you to connect compatible devices like phones and tablets. Using NFC and wireless, you can mirror your phone or tablet on your TV screen. However, if you have a library of 3D movies you want to play, keep in mind this LG TV does not have 3D capabilities.","This TV has three HDMI and three USB ports. The USB ports are convenient for extra multimedia content that you want displayed on your TV. Three HDMI ports are suitable, but the best LED TVs have four HDMI ports to handle all of your high-definition devices. Three is passable, however, for typical use.","Customers who buy LG products also buy into the brand and reputation. The LN5700 comes with the industry-standard one-year warranty. LG is one of the biggest LED TV companies and its service includes support through live chat, over the phone and email. LG support tested passable for helpfulness. The representatives we reached answered specific questions by simply referring us back to the website."]},"id":"c6dc132d-4979-4064-9186-09f5b192ce0d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0c43be91-f665-4d64-92d1-6af5b15acb5d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The LG LN5700 is a decent high-end TV that offers a tad better value than some other high-end TVs.
