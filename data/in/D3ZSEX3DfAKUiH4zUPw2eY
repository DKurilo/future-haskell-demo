There&#39;s a lot of black screen and the program isn&#39;t fun to use.","There is no clip art available with in the program, but there are over 600 superb color nature and animal photos that you can import, and there are about 150 greeting card templates from which you can choose.","If you enjoy National Geographic&#39;s famous photography and want to have access to these images for your greeting cards, then this program may be worth the price for just the photo library.","But National Geographic Greeting Cards has limited capabilities compared to higher-ranked products.
