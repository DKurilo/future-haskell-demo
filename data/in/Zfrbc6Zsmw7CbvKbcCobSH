You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you need to get somewhere, you&#39;ll be in good hands with the Clarion NX700 leading the way. This <a href=\"/best-in-dash-navigation-systems\">car GPS navigation</a> system features a variety of helpful tools to both entertain and inform. It&#39;s missing some key navigational features, and it is not ready for HD Radio, but for those looking for a simple in-dash navigation system, the NX700 will not disappoint.","With over 12 millions points of interest (POIs) and the reliable NAVTEQ map database at the helm, this double DIN in-dash GPS is off to a good start. The 7-inch touchscreen monitor will let you easily see intended directions, whether you&#39;re using the 2D overhead map or the 3D street view map. You can also switch the voice and text commands to a different language, if needed.","In a world where many people are becoming more eco-conscious, many GPS navigation units now feature eco-friendly functions. The NX700 does not have this function. This is disappointing because this feature can help you save money as well as the environment.","Also, while this in-dash navigation system can give you voice guidance or text-to-speech audio directions, it does not feature voice control. This means you don&#39;t have to look down as you&#39;re trying to find your location, because of the audio cues, but you&#39;ll have to use the buttons on the keypad when you&#39;re entering a location. This may not deter some buyers, but voice control is a newer feature that we were looking for in all the GPS units we reviewed.","You can keep your hands free while talking on the phone, however, with the built-in Bluetooth. Simply sync up your phone with the in-dash navigation receiver, and you can call and receive calls through your car stereo. You can also sync up your Bluetooth-enabled MP3 player to the in-dash receiver and play your music through the stereo without any wires.","In case your media player is not Bluetooth-enabled, the Clarion NX700 allows you to connect your device to the receiver using the USB port or the auxiliary input. Or, if you choose, you can use the CD/DVD slot to play all your music and movies. This disc drive can recognize a variety of formats, including DiVX, MP3 and WMA.","The NX700 in-dash navigation unit is also ready for satellite radio, such as SIRIUS and XM. However, in order to get these signals, it will require an additional adapter. For SIRIUS satellite radio, you&#39;ll need the CLA-SC1 and the SC-C1 adapters, and for XM you will need the CNP2000UC and the CNPCLA1 adapters. Oddly enough, though this device is compatible with satellite radio signals, it doesn&#39;t seem to be able to get HD Radio.","On the Clarion site you can find the manual for the NX700, as well as an installation manual. There is also a FAQs page on their website where you can find quick answers to commonly asked questions. If you have additional questions about your in-dash navigation system, you can contact the Clarion Corporation of America by phone, but we were unable to find an email address for customer support."]},"id":"8e59483e-5bce-4ce8-97f2-46bcb7ffa06e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"28f987a9-40fd-493f-bfd6-f0b8414da222","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The large touchscreen monitor and extensive map database make this in-dash navigation system very attractive, but be aware that it is missing some key features.
