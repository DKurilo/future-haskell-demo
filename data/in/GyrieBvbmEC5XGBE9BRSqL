The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-online-personal-loans\">Online Personal Loans</a> here.</em>","Unexpected expenses come up; it happens to all of us. If your only option is an online personal loan, apply for one that will help you out of debt, not further into it. RISE is an online lender, not a third party, that can help you find the right loan amount for the best APR you can qualify for. This lending service even has a rewards program so you can earn a discount on future loans. You have to live in one of only 14 qualifying states, but if you do, RISE is a good way to go.","If you need a fast cash loan, fast, you&#39;ll want short approval times and large loan amounts. With RISE, you can be approved in a few seconds for up to $5,000. The best personal loans also have relatively low interest rates. Depending on where you live, your credit score and other qualifications, you can expect to see an APR between 36% and 360% from RISE. A rate of 360% is less than other comparable online loan services, but is still much, much more expensive than other means of credit.","Based out of Fort Worth, Texas, RISE has been a direct lender of unsecured personal loans since 2005. You can only apply for a RISE loan if you live in one of 14 participating states: Alabama, California, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah or Wisconsin. If you&#39;re one of the lucky few, you can have your loan deposited in your bank account by the next business day. However, there is no overnight deposit option and you can&#39;t apply for a loan over the phone.","One unique feature that makes RISE stand above the rest is its rewards program. Every time you make an early payment, pay extra or have a birthday, you&#39;ll earn points. You can then redeem them for a discount on your next loan.","The application process is lengthy, and you&#39;ll need to provide some sensitive information for the online form. To qualify for a personal loan online through RISE, you&#39;ll need to pass a credit check, provide your Social Security number, have a driver license, provide your checking account number and have a form of income. RISE doesn&#39;t require you to be employed, but you do need to have Social Security benefits, disability checks or another source of steady income. If you&#39;ve declared bankruptcy, don’t have any income or are under 18 years old, you won&#39;t be able to qualify for a loan. You might be asked for some faxed documents as well, so get that fax machine dusted off.","Cash loans online typically have short-term lengths. RISE, however, offers loans with terms of up to two years (depending on your state regulations). You&#39;ll also have repayment options including online transfer and the option to renew or extend your loan. There is a fee for late payments on RISE loans, but you won&#39;t be charged a fee if you&#39;re able to pay the full price of your loan earlier than your deadline.","Like with the best personal loan companies, you&#39;ll find loads of contact information on the site. Available support includes phone numbers, email forms, three physical addresses, fax support and more. FAQs, terms and conditions and licensing information are all easy to find as well. Although there isn’t a live chat feature, representatives responded to our email quickly and all of our questions were answered thoroughly."]},"id":"abb1305a-932a-44b0-ae94-0b286b1bb638","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"12b638b1-594b-4399-9894-096ab5919028","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If a personal loan is your only financial option, RISE can help you find the best online loan to pay off your debts.
