Created by Microsoft and IBM, WAV was one of the first audio file types developed for the PC.    WAV files are defined as lossless, meaning that files are large and complete; nothing has been lost.    Professionally recorded CDs are also a lossless audio source.","In contrast, the three audio formats listed below are lossy-redundant and non-auditory data is removed to allow for more compact storage; in essence, some data has been lost.    This process of removing data to shrink the file size is called compression.","The three file formats below must begin with a lossless format-such as a store-bought CD or a computer WAV file-then compress it.    Most lossy formats boast little or no detectable change in sound quality.    But because each compressing format selects the deleteable data differently, converting one compressed file into another lossy format will sometimes result in lower quality audio. Again, always start with a CD or WAV file, then compress."]},"id":"9a8cde70-84ac-4a8b-92bf-b770def873b3","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<b>MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (.mp3)</b>","MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (.mp3) is a common, compressed WAV file.

Ogg Vorbis is also open source (free to all, unlicensed, no strings attached).    While MP3 compresses data at a constant bit rate, Ogg uses a variable bit rate.    To illustrate-if you are copying chunks of silence into MP3 format, the compression bit rate stays the same as if you were compressing the sound of an entire orchestra.    But if you are copying chunks of silence into Ogg, your compression rate will drop to nothing.    The rate varies with the need."]},"id":"77774fbf-a8c9-491c-baf3-8476d06ff844","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" "," "]},"id":"63477bdb-4fdc-45d7-bc2a-dd66a9c1622f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Other Audio File Types"},"id":"37a5aa67-5458-4f78-8d9e-a0e4b63e5951","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":[""],"type":"ul"},"id":"ed0529d6-e1b5-4299-a770-5b4cf6f3b4b1","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<b>Musical Instrument Digital Interface (.midi)</b>","Musical Instrument Digital Interface (.midi) is commonly used for computer keyboards and other computer-based musical tools.
