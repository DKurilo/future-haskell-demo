It’s also important to note, Houston doesn&#39;t put restrictions on loan APRs, so in spite of the regulations, these are small-dollar loans at a high cost.","<strong>Borrower Beware: Payday Loans Can Lead to Bad Credit</strong>","There&#39;s no credit check with most payday loans because credit only plays a role if you miss a payment. The biggest risk with payday loans is that you could get stuck in a cycle of borrowing money to pay bills, and then come payday, you need to borrow again to pay off your loan. With each loan you take out, you&#39;re agreeing to pay high interest rates for the ability to borrow. If, at some point, you fail to make a payment to the payday loan company you borrowed from, they could report the action to credit agencies.","Unfortunately, the loan companies typically only report on defaults, rather than when you make payments on time. So, the only way for your credit to be affected in this case is negatively. If you need a loan to pay bills, you may be able to borrow from a local credit union or regional bank, which offers much lower APR and flexible terms for the loan. Plus, many credit unions and banks report your account activity, good or bad, which could lead to good credit for you.","<strong>CSO &amp; CAB: What Are They?</strong>","Payday loan companies in Houston must register as Credit Services Organizations, or CSOs. Another licensing option is Credit Access Business, or CAB. In both cases, the companies that register with these offices must work with third-party lenders, and then you&#39;re subjected to fees labeled CSO fee or CAB fee on top of your APR. Simply put, most companies you work with for quick, small cash loans are middlemen for the actual lenders. So, even if you find a payday loan company that has a low APR compared to the industry average of 391 percent, for a 14-day loan, you may be paying double the interest when you factor in the CSO or CAB fee.","For example:"]},"id":"d23ad444-11cf-41f1-b936-66fea16221f9","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Loan Company XYZ offers: $300","Loan length: 4 months","APR: 190%","CAB fee: $121.19","Interest charge: $6.25"],"type":"ul"},"id":"945efa33-e4ec-4836-9075-3e02f61802b8","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although a small loan company could claim the total repayment amount is $427.44, the total including all of the fees comes to $554.88.

You can get the cash you need to pay bills or an unexpected expense. It&#39;s vital you understand that these loans come with extremely high interest rates and extra fees, and it could be difficult for you to pay off what you owe without having to borrow again.
