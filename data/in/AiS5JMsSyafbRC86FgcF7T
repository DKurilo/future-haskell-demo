You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Frontgate Solar Stud Light 110103 measures 3.5 inches in diameter by 2.75 inches high and gives you plenty of light with a low profile because you bury it in the ground up to the solar disc. A hefty weight of 2 pounds adds stability and prevents the <a href=\"/best-solar-lights\">solar powered outdoor light</a> from working its way out of the ground.","The LEDs in this outdoor solar light emit one watt of light equal to 10 lumens apiece. In addition, it uses a AAA nickel and metal hybrid battery that operates on 1.2 volts and draws 600 amps per hour. The battery provides a good power source for efficient operation.","These outdoor solar lights contain five LEDS, one in the center and the others arranged in a ring around the perimeter of the solar panel. They give out a warm white light. Some individuals may consider this important, since the color of light emitted sets the mood for an area. Cool whites are harsher, while warm whites have more of a soft glow. Because these LEDs are high output, they should last around 20,000 hours.","After soaking up energy from the sun during the day, these lights come on at sundown and illuminate the area for hours. With that said, while most of the customer reviews we read were very positive, some customers complained about a short battery life and others complained that the lights didn’t last as long as the manufacturer said they would. Multiple customers also complained that the lights were not sufficiently bright. Our value pick, the <a href=\"/kenroy-home-review\">Kenroy Home KEH-60503</a>, is a similar light that works in much the same way.","You can place this set of lights in your lawn, gravel, mulch or around a deck or swimming pool. This solar yard light comes with five pieces, including a hex handle to make it more convenient for placement on wood decking. When using these lights on a wooden deck or around a pool, you need to drill holes so you can insert them. The hex handle will fit handily on the end of a drill for this purpose."]},"id":"dd4cdea8-829d-48b1-8ddf-93571c23fdfa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0ca6681e-7be1-4d8d-a163-0127a4770028","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Frontgate Solar Stud lights install quickly and remain unobtrusive during the day then illuminate nicely at night. However, it’s not as bright as some of the lights in our lineup. The solar panel is integrated into the light itself between five LED lights. While most of the reviews online were positive, some customers complained of short battery life and some said the longevity of the light itself was a problem. It comes in a five-piece set which makes it a good option for people who want to place the lights on a deck or along a path.","<em><strong>Contributing Reviewer:</strong></em> Noel Case"]},"id":"e1487b01-0813-450f-83c9-10dbda93daef","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67028","url":"/frontgate-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-18T18:51:44Z","datePublished":"2015-09-18T18:51:44Z","name":"Frontgate Solar Stud","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":52,"verdict":"The Frontgate Solar Stud is an unobtrusive outdoor solar light that installs quickly.","pros":["This solar light is made up of five LED lights and a bright output."],"cons":["Some customers have complained about a short battery life."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-03-19T00:00:00Z","id":"AiS5JMsSyafbRC86FgcF7T","meta":{"title":"Frontgate Solar Stud Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Frontgate Solar Stud Light 110103 provides light on walkways or illuminates your garden with solar lights.
