You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Raleigh Espresso from ChimneyFree is a <a href=\"/best-electric-fireplaces\">freestanding electric fireplace</a> with mounting capability, allowing you to secure the unit to the wall. This small electric fireplace is 38 inches tall, 31 inches wide and 12 inches deep. Because it weighs just over 85 pounds, it&#39;s a good idea to anchor the unit to prevent it from toppling over. The ChimneyFree Raleigh&#39;s compact size makes this electric fireplace ideal for small spaces.","The ChimneyFree Raleigh electric fireplace can warm areas of up to 1,000 square feet using infrared heat. The 1,500-watt heater uses 5,200 BTUs and plugs into a standard 120-volt outlet. The LED flame is adjustable and can be used throughout the year, with or without heat. The log fuel bed glows realistically when the flame is operating.","This unit helps you maximize space. The mantel can hold a flat-screen TV. This electric fireplace console also has a nearly 6-inch-tall open shelf space above the 23-inch-wide electric firebox that you can use for media electronics or book storage. It comes with a remote control for added convenience.","The electric fireplace does not have any sound effects. However, if you want that element of the realistic fireplace experience, you can purchase a fire-crackler sound system separately from many retailers. Above the electric firebox, you&#39;ll find the heat vent and a display of the temperature. Controls for operating this electronic fireplace heater are also located above the firebox next to the vent. The Raleigh Espresso electric fireplace also comes with the standard one-year limited warranty.","The ChimneyFree Raleigh Espresso&#39;s best feature is the amount of supplemental heat it puts out. Its ability to warm up to 1,000 square feet makes this a powerful electric fireplace. The compact size allows you to use it in small rooms if you&#39;re limited on space in your home. You can use this unit as not only a source of heat, but also as a TV stand. The power and versatility of this unit make it an efficient addition to your home."]},"id":"3e008933-0914-43f3-ba97-e8f1d36f9089","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59378","url":"/chimneyfree-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-18T16:02:17Z","datePublished":"2014-04-18T16:02:17Z","name":"ChimneyFree Raleigh Espresso","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
