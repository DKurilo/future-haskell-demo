It’s heavier at more than 9 pounds, and doesn’t move as effortlessly as some we tested. If you’re not as concerned about the usual features you’d find in a stick vac, though, this is one of the best we tested in performance and suction.","On carpet, the Corded Cyclonic completely cleaned our test area in only four passes, putting it on par with the top stick vacuums. The brushroll converts nicely, with the hardwood test taking four passes as well. We tested pet hair embedded in carpet, and the Corded Cyclonic left the entire area spotless. At 11 inches, it has the widest cleaning path of the stick vacuum cleaners we tested, though it was harder to maneuver.","Again, the Cyclonic feels like a hybrid between a stick and a full-size vacuum. It doesn’t have a rechargeable battery and needs to be plugged in, which can be inconvenient if you’re buying a stick vacuum mainly for quick cleanups. The cord is nice and long, running 20 feet total. The handle has an extreme recline, so you can easily reach under chairs and tables.","One major drawback of the Corded Cyclonic is that it doesn’t come with any attachments, which makes it harder to use as a full replacement of a larger vacuum. There is no crevice tool for cleaning tight areas and no dusting brush for cleaning upholstery or curtains. A stick vacuum that comes with many attachments is the <a href=\"/home/vacuum-carpet-cleaning/best-stick-vacuums/black-decker-review/\">Black &amp; Decker Lithium Ion</a>.","Despite its powerful motor, it did fine on our sound test, coming in at 84 decibels. The dust bin is large. At 1.2 liters, it’s twice the size of average stick vac bins. The dust bin is removable and doesn’t require bags. The filter clicks off as well and can be washed in between uses."]},"id":"579cb1f6-527b-44a5-96cc-21ed1c873481","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"72778ec9-f1ed-4cce-89a0-2a5bd3a59ad4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Hoover Corded Cyclonic is a good vacuum if you’re not in need of the usual attributes of a stick but want something smaller than a full-size upright.
