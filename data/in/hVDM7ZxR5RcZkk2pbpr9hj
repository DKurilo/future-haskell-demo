You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This 14,000 Btu <a href=\"/best-portable-air-conditioners\">portable air conditioner</a> works best for cooling rooms around 700 square feet – matching the highest max airflow of all the portable air conditioners in our lineup. You wouldn&#39;t want an AC unit this powerful in a smaller room. This LG model can produce airflow up to 270 cubic feet per minute. You can also use the three-speed fan to keep the room comfortable, and having the option of switching to lower speeds helps save energy.","This model has a dehumidifier mode that removes 3.4 pints of water per hour. If you live in a humid area, you&#39;ll want to check the water tank frequently, especially if you regularly use the dehumidify function. Since this unit lacks an auto evaporation system, you need to drain it yourself. To drain the unit, a cap on the back unscrews easily, letting the water escape from the storage reservoir.","This unit is above average for energy efficiency. With a 10.1 energy efficiency ratio (EER), you can expect this model to cost an estimated $119 per year. Such a high Btu production makes this LG model more expensive to operate. It&#39;s also concerning this model lacks any industry ratings from UL, ASHRAE, RoHS or ETL. These ratings indicate the unit has been tested for hazardous materials and safety standards.","This LG model has most of the standard features such as a remote, timer, three-speed fan, dehumidifier and auto restart. The three-speed fan works best when you&#39;re trying to conserve energy or just want to circulate air around the room. Unfortunately, this model lacks a sleep mode to run during the night. This mode not only helps you catch Z&#39;s comfortably – it also slowly raises the temperature through the night to conserve energy.","The unit is large and heavy, so we recommend two or more people lift it out of the box. The vent panel works best for 18- to 50-inch windows, but you can extend this panel for larger windows with extra components. Most of the materials you need come included, such as the window seals, brackets and screws. You still need to cut the seals to fit your window and screw the window bracket in place if you don&#39;t plan to move the unit. When installing, be sure to leave at least 20 inches of airspace around the unit to vent properly.","It also has many impressive features and enough power to cool a large area. Standing 31.33 inches tall and only 13 inches wide, this portable AC unit is tall and slender enough to fit in most spaces, even in studio apartments. Plus, the oscillating louvers add a touch of modernity to this AC unit. The oscillating louvers are an uncommon feature that, when activated, turn the fan slats automatically from side to side, more evenly distributing the air and saving you the trouble of getting up to adjust them.","This floor air conditioner only comes with a one-year warranty, which is much shorter than the five-year warranty on our top pick, the <a href=\"/frigidaire-gallery-review\">Frigidaire Gallery</a>. LG builds quality products, so it would be nice to have it backed with a more generous warranty. LG has a good support system with live chat, email and phone options to answer any questions or concerns you might have. There is a helpful FAQs section on the website and an online manual you can download."]},"id":"20f148b0-f46b-4276-8a8e-540e123b3382","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c0c3e54a-0b9b-4e4f-b3dc-fdad7de68196","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you have a large upstairs room that can&#39;t seem to cool off, this LG model may be a good fit.
