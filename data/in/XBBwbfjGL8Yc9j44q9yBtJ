The Samsung RF23HCEDBSR/AA is a large-capacity fridge that is Energy Star compliant, though it uses a bit more electricity than the best French door refrigerators in our review. The 21.9 cubic feet cost about $84 per year to run, while similar models cost $60 or less. For a more efficient option, check out the <a href=\"http://www.toptenreviews.com/home/kitchen/best-french-door-refrigerators/frigidaire-review/\">Frigidaire Gallery FGHF2366PF</a>.","The Samsung&#39;s <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-french-door-refrigerators/\">refrigerator</a> section has 15.7 cubic feet of storage space. It contains five adjustable, spill-proof shelves and three drawers, including two temperature-controlled crisper bins. It has a full-length bin that holds party platters or meats and cheese. There is a total of six in-door bins. Two of these are gallon-sized to hold large, bulky grocery items, such as milk. However, this model doesn’t have a designated dairy bin.","There is ample space in the two-tiered freezer. Each tier has a large storage bin. With both tiers, it can hold up to 6.8 cubic feet of food. If you accidentally leave one of the doors open, including the freezer, the Samsung sounds a reminder alarm to remind you to close it and save energy.","The icemaker is located in the refrigerator, with the holding bin in the door as part of the dispenser. This bin holds 2.7 pounds of ice at a time. The dispenser is also designed to allow tall or bulky glasses, pitchers, and containers to fit under the water stream and easily fill.","If something breaks on your Samsung fridge, it is covered for one year of parts replacement and labor costs. Samsung offers extended warranties too – five years for the sealed system and 10 years for the compressor. You can call or use the online chat support feature to speak to a live person. Email support is also available.","The Samsung RF23HCEDBSR/AA has a lot of storage space in both the refrigerator and freezer compartments. The water and ice dispenser is designed to fit tall glasses and pitchers easily, and the extended warranties protect your investment in case something breaks. While it is Energy Star compliant, there are other French door refrigerators that use less power to operate."]},"id":"47476e5e-0472-47d0-8cf7-c4067a7bd878","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_51079","url":"/samsung-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-05T10:05:21Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-10-12T15:29:29Z","datePublished":"2010-10-12T15:29:29Z","name":"Samsung RF23HCEDBSR/AA","synopsis":"Samsung is a top manufacturer of home electronics, but it is becoming popular in home appliances, including its French door refrigerators.","review":{"rating":82,"verdict":"This fridge has a nice feature package that includes both essentials and conveniences like spillproof shelves.
