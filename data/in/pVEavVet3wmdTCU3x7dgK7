Although we were initially skeptical about how effective this single fan could be, its ability to push a maximum airflow of 70 CFM quickly quelled any doubts we had.","Even though it circulates an impressive amount of air, the SF-17 is relatively quiet. At its highest setting, it produces as noise level of only 21 dBA, which is slightly below average for the laptop coolers we reviewed. Most laptop cooling pads are powered by USB, so it&#39;s a big plus when they have extra ports. Cooler Master designed the SF-17 with four additional USB ports. It&#39;s not uncommon to use several USB devices like keyboards, mice, microphones and headsets while gaming on a laptop, so having a lot of ports to work with can be invaluable.","It has impressive technical specs, but the SF-17 also performs well in a practical sense.

Using the dial, you can fluidly adjust the speed of the fan to find your own optimum balance between noise and cooling. Thanks to its adjustable height, the SF-17 is very comfortable to use. By tilting the platform, you can orient your screen in a position that reduces eyestrain and makes the laptop easy to use.","Unlike some laptop coolers, however, the SF-17 isn&#39;t a great cooling pad to use in your lap. Its flat and somewhat bulky design means it&#39;s much better suited to flat surfaces. While this isn’t a serious concern for many gamers, it&#39;s certainly less than convenient for those who like to occasionally work from the couch. Any product you buy should be durable, but since you’re buying a cooling pad to lengthen your laptop’s lifespan, it makes sense to buy one that will last just as long.
