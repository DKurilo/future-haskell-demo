A fantastic selection of drawing tools packs the sides of your workspace, calling out to create fantastic cartoon creatures. And for a professional finish, shading tools, speed and focus lines, vector tools and airbrushes are at your disposal.","Creating images with a mouse is quite difficult so it only makes sense that this comic book software is compatible with a pen tablet. With this functionality you can create layers, add special effects and more. Anime Studio Debut 8 has character templates, but because it isn’t meant to solely create comic books, it doesn’t have page templates, word balloons or spell check.","Because Anime Studio Debut 8 is primarily animation software, the files you can save it in are all video formats. You can export images from the software, but here’s where it gets tricky. Because you are essentially creating a video, when you request to export, it will create an image for every single scene unless you state otherwise. We tried exporting an image we made and ended up with 145 of the exact same picture on our desktop. You can export your images into several different file formats: BMP, JPEG, PNG, TGA and PSD.","Anime Studio Debut 8 is another product of the famous SmithMicro Software corporation. They have customer support down to a T. On their product page you’ll find technical information and links to technical support. You can email, call or chat with a representative for assistance."]},"id":"b3956017-0131-4716-bd1b-23ba0f3a2e28","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2ee9f0dd-b16a-43e4-a849-02a03a364aef","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although it&#39;s marketed as comic book software, we think Anime Studio Debut 8 is too much of an animation software to beat out competing comic software.
