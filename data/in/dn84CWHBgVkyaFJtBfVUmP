There are thousands of promotional products out there, so it&#39;s important to put a lot of thought into your selection in order to ensure that your product is both useful and memorable. Here are ten non-traditional items carried by the <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/internet-marketing-services/\">promotional product stores</a><strong> </strong>we reviewed that will help your company get the recognition it deserves."]},"id":"7eb45541-3c01-4735-8e48-e516b86180b7","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<strong>Beach Safe.</strong> Going to the beach generally means having to leave your money and valuables in your car, hidden in a shoe or buried at the bottom of a beach bag. None of these methods are particularly secure, and they all keep you separated from your money, credit cards and other valuables. A beach safe is a waterproof device that can be easily carried on your person as you splash around in the sea. It s a perfect giveaway for any business that operates in a coastal town because everyone will appreciate the thought, use the item and remember your business.<br/> ","<strong>Hand-Powered Flashlight. </strong>There are a lot of these types of flashlights these days, and whether they use kinetic energy, a hand crack or another source of power, they are always useful and eco-friendly. These flashlights are always ready in case of an emergency because they aren t reliant on batteries. No matter what industry you are in, a hand-powered flashlight is always a great promotional giveaway.<br/> ","<strong>Pool Toys.</strong> This giveaway is obviously best for businesses that sell pool supplies, and for them it is practically a must. Don&#39;t forget that you want people to remember your brand in context, and there s no better way to remind people of your pool supplies than to give them something they can use while swimming.<br/> ","<strong>Wine Stoppers.</strong> These are one of those items that many people need but few people actually own. Give your customers something they will actually use and they ll be sure to look kindly on your brand every time they pull their wine stopper out of their drawer.<br/> ","<strong>Speakers.</strong> Almost everyone owns an MP3 player these days, and while few companies give away speakers for these devices, those that do find that their customers usually appreciate it. Speakers are a great promotional product for a variety of businesses, including tech stores, music shops and more.<br/> ","<strong>Aprons.</strong> While plenty of companies give away shirts and hats, any company that operates in the cooking or barbecuing industries will see a much more positive response from aprons. These are another item that many people need but often don&#39;t own.<br/> ","<strong>Spa Gifts.</strong> Nothing says that you care about your customers&#39; serenity more than a gift that helps them relax at home. Whether it s an aromatherapy set, a wooden back massager, slippers, lotions, a pedicure set or any other home spa tools, customers are sure to appreciate the sentiment. These giveaways are best for those in the business of relaxation, such as masseuses, spas and yoga studios.<br/> ","<strong>Pedometers.</strong> While this gift may not be appropriate for all business types, if your company is in the weight-loss, fitness or health industries, a pedometer can be a great promotional product to remind clients to walk more and stay healthy. <br/> ","<strong>Business Card Holders. </strong>Business-to-business companies can easily show clients they understand the value of making contacts by distributing these simple but useful promotional products.<br/> ","<strong>Plastic Bag Dispensers. </strong>If you operate in the pet care industry, then your clients probably rely on plastic bags to clean up after their animals while out on walks. By giving them a plastic bag dispenser, you re able to remind them that you know everything that goes in to having an animal, which is something they ll remember whenever they reach for your dispenser."],"type":"ol"},"id":"2c4f2ad5-0ba8-4203-8f37-8762bdd67d1a","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While all of the promotional product stores we reviewed offer an expansive selection of items, InkHead has some of the most unique items.
