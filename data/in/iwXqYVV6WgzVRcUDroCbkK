Our goal in choosing the best overall product was to find a reliable brand that provides a wide selection of range hoods and offers decent warranties. We also sought looked for brands that produce powerful fans and make it easy to find replacement parts. In order to write unbiased reviews, we made a list of the products, prices, warranties and assets of each brand and compared them against each other. Broan came out on top because it has the widest selection of options starting at mid-range prices. It also has some of the highest and most consistent user reviews of any brand.","<strong>How We Evaluated </strong>","We spent more than 45 hours over the last three years comparing and evaluating seven range hood brands to determine the best of the best. While we did not test range hoods ourselves, we thoroughly evaluated each brand by reading hundreds of consumer reviews and ratings. We began by making a list of the advantages, features and warranty lengths offered by each company and then compared them against each other to see which brands make buying and maintaining range hoods the easiest.","We gave higher scores to companies that offer the largest selection of hoods. This includes vented, non-vented and convertible products. We also gave more points to companies that offer range hoods in a variety of sizes, shapes and styles, including traditional styles like wall mounted hoods, and more elaborate options like chimney and island range hoods. The materials a company uses also came into play. Brands that offer several different colors and materials scored higher since this makes them more likely to fit in a variety of homes.","Most range hood companies provide a one-year limited warranty from the date of purchase. Companies that provide longer or more in-depth warranties scored higher in this category. We also gave more points to companies whose websites make it easier to find and order replacement parts and filters. Additionally, products that offer Energy Star certified products as well as ADA capable options ranked higher.","<strong>How Much Does a Range Hood Cost?</strong>","Because range hoods come in so many different styles and are made to go either under cabinets or over islands, they fall in a wide price range. Generally, you can find a decent under-cabinet range hood for under $80, while fancier range hoods, including over-island models, can easily cost $600 or more.","<strong>Are Range Hoods Required?</strong>","Are you updating your kitchen or building a new home and wondering if you need a range hood? It may depend on your location. &#34;Most residential building codes do not require a range hood above a stove or cook top, but you’d be wise to ensure your locale is not the exception,&#34; said Mary Boone, a contributing writer to the <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/blog/do-i-need-a-range-hood-143676/\">Zillow Porchlight blog</a>. &#34;Even if it’s not legally required, you should think long and hard before forgoing a hood altogether.&#34; We agree with her. Range hoods collect the fumes and grease from your cooking, and they help keep your home from smelling terrible when you burn something. Although range hoods may not be required, they can accent your decor while providing ventilation and, depending on the model, excellent filtration. With hundreds of options and styles to choose from, it can be hard to find the right look and level of filtration. Read on for the features you should consider when choosing a range hood.","<strong>Range Hoods: What to Look For</strong> <br/><br/>Ducted or Non-Ducted<br/>This is possibly the most important decision to make to narrow your search since range hoods are designed to circulate air. Vented models can be connected to ductwork in the walls or ceiling to pull air out of the house. Of course, if you have a condominium or a townhouse, you may need to install a ductless model that draws steam and smoke away from the stove and blows it back into the kitchen.<br/><br/>Airflow &amp; Filtration<br/>For a ducted hood, the greater the airflow, the faster the fans can vent the air through the filtration system. If, for example, you have a kitchen island and like to cook a lot of meat on an indoor griddle, look for models that have airflow, which is measured in cubic feet per minute, or cfm, of at least 400. Charcoal filters can do more to pull particles out of the air, but mesh filters are reusable and washable. If you are an active cook and can only install a ductless hood, it&#39;s advisable to look for a model with a charcoal filter to maximize filtration.","Size &amp; Style<br/>If your stove sits under your cabinets, your choices may be limited to under-cabinet range hoods. Likewise, if you have a kitchen island, you will need a convertible or an island hood that vents the air through the ducts in the ceiling above the kitchen. You could also opt for a downdraft-style hood for your island, which pulls the air down and vents it through the floor. Likewise, if you have a kitchen island with a <a href=\"/best-gas-cooktops\">gas cooktop</a> or <a href=\"/best-electric-cooktop-ranges\">electric cooktop</a>, you will need a convertible or an island hood that vents the air through the ducts in the ceiling above the kitchen.","If you are remodeling but planning to put the stove against the wall, you can opt for a chimney-style or any wall-mounted model. In terms of dimensions, you may want to run a little larger instead of sizing down. The hood should amply cover the surface area of the stove so it can do an optimal job of keeping grease and smoke out of the rest of your kitchen and home.","Active cooks have plenty of choices in range hoods to keep the air free of smoke during cooking.
