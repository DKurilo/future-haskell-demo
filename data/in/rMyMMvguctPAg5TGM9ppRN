You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Cadillac Escalade has earned a reputation as a sleek, high-performance luxury vehicle. Offer your child a similar experience with the Fisher-Price Power Wheels Cadillac Escalade EXT. This vehicle has many luxury features, including two seats, a real FM radio, see-through windows, chrome wheels and grill, doors that open and close, and a battery charge indicator.","This <a href=\"/best-ride-on-toys\">Power Wheels toy</a> vehicle has a 12-volt battery, which powers its two forward speed of 2.5-MPH and 5-MPH in addition to a reverse speed of 2.5-MPH. As is typical among all beginner driver Power Wheel vehicles, the Escalade has a Power Lock Brake System intended to bring the vehicle to a full stop whenever the gas pedal isn&#39;t being pushed. If you&#39;re concerned about your child using the high speed of 5-MPH, you can use the high-speed lockout feature to keep the top speed at 2.5-MPH.","The radio requires four C batteries for operation, but the car itself has a 12-volt battery that it needs for performance. At the 5-MPH speed, you can expect your child to get upwards of 70 minutes of use out of the vehicle, whereas the lower speed will get them closer to three hours.","Fisher-Price has more than 30 years experience, which means that you&#39;ll be sure to get the best value for your expense with these Power Wheel vehicles. The Escalade has a one-year &#34;Bumper to Bumper&#34; limited warranty that is good at more than 300 service centers throughout the nation. Fisher-Price also offers a support phone number for general inquiries regarding how to deal with vehicle repairs.","This vehicle is not designed for off-road capabilities, and it will easily lose traction on grassy slopes and rocky surfaces. It&#39;s advertised to accommodate children between the ages of three and 10, though that doesn&#39;t mean the vehicle is large enough to actually fit 10-year-olds. It&#39;s still best suited for children between the ages of three and six, though some younger and older kids may still be able to use it.","If you want to give your child a luxury experience for their first car, the Power Wheels Cadillac Escalade EXT is an ideal fit. It offers power and speed, though is limited in the terrain it can drive on. The vehicle looks quite fancy and will give your child countless hours of entertainment and numerous opportunities to expand their imagination as they hit the road for the next big adventure."]},"id":"36a81f63-9101-4cfa-b30b-a1327ff608a6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55394","url":"/fisher-price-power-wheels-cadillac-escalade-ext-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-15T17:20:04Z","datePublished":"2012-11-15T17:20:04Z","name":"Cadillac Escalade EXT","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2012-11-15T17:20:04Z","id":"rMyMMvguctPAg5TGM9ppRN","meta":{"title":"Cadillac Escalade EXT Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Fisher-Price Power Wheels Cadillac Escalade EXT  is a ride-on toy car with luxury features.
