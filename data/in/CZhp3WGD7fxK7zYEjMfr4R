These monitors feature pen sensitivity so you can create thicker or thinner pen strokes by pressing harder or lighter on the screen.","<strong>Which Drawing Tablet Is the Best?</strong>","When it comes to drawing tablets, Wacom is by far the best brand, but it also happens to be the most expensive. Wacom tablets are the standard for graphic designers, animators, illustrators and other digital artists. If you’d like to find something a little cheaper that performs just as well, Huion is a good brand to choose. These tablets work beautifully at a much lower price, though some artists find that they don’t have as much sensitivity or as many features as Wacom products. We recommend the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Drawing-Pressure-Sensitivity-Carrying/dp/B074DTP2V4/?tag=hawk-future-20&amp;ascsubtag=toptenreviews\">Huion H610 Pro</a> as a good entry level drawing tablet.","Useful Tools to Look For<br/>More-advanced 2D animation programs allow you to create storyboards to visualize each shot of your project. The best storyboards help you add dialogue to each scene, apply sketches and figure out camera placement. Not all 2D animation programs come with storyboards, but if you simply want to have fun with the program, it isn&#39;t necessarily a needed feature."]},"id":"f030491b-d10e-4d3e-b3e0-9544e8365ac6","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/5vskXNzJ3NyMwmgjL7bVtc.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/muvizu-testing/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9ZLzUvNzg2NjA1L29yaWdpbmFsL011dml6dTctRWRpdGVkLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vskXNzJ3NyMwmgjL7bVtc.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"5vskXNzJ3NyMwmgjL7bVtc","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vskXNzJ3NyMwmgjL7bVtc.jpg","alt":""},"id":"8d4d5dc6-d804-4e24-ba44-f2563c3d991b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The tools you use to create your characters can give them added depth. Some programs come with a variety of brush types to help you find the right style to match your visions. Example brushes include watercolor, pencil and felt tips. Layers are also useful in helping you design the perfect visual style. Advanced programs will help you add effects to various layers that can be altered independently of the other layers.","When we contacted Troughton at Toon Boom Harmony, she told us that depending on your experience level, it can take anywhere from a couple of days to a few weeks to become proficient in the software. But it can be made easier with the help of an extensive learning center complete with forums and tutorials. Many professional-level companies will also offer learning courses on their website or on sites like Lynda.com. While you must pay to attend, you will better understand the software in less time. Troughton also told us that Toon Boom has a huge community of users who &#34;are creating content to help others learn [the] software.&#34;","Defining Onion Skinning, Bone-Rigging and Tweening<br/>When it comes to animating your characters, there are a few advanced tools that can make your creations move more smoothly and believably. The onion skinning feature can be found in both advanced and beginner programs. This allows you to compare your current frame against the previous and upcoming frames in order to make sure your character moves fluidly.","Rigging is basically the same as puppeteering: It allows you to move your characters in the way you want. Bone-rigging is a more complex tool that basically allows you to create a skeleton within your characters that you can move. This gives you more control so you can orchestrate more lifelike movements. Tweening is a term that refers to making transitional images between various character positions in order to create the illusion of movement. Some programs can complete tweening for you, which saves time and helps your animations move smoothly.","<strong>Are Animation Jobs in Demand?</strong>","You bet they are. As of 2016 there were over 73,700 people employed as animators and multimedia artists. According to the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/multimedia-artists-and-animators.htm#tab-1\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>(BLS), the employment of multimedia artists and animators is expected to grow 8 percent from 2016 to 2026, which is average for all occupations. These types of artists will be needed for video games, movies, TV shows, commercials, advertising, etc. The Bureau goes on to state that the median annual wage for multimedia artists and animators was $70,530 in May 2017. However, just because there are jobs out there doesn’t mean getting hired is a walk in the park. Most employers require animators to have a bachelor’s degree for entry level positions. You’ll also have to prove that you have teamwork skills, a knowledge of animation software and the artistic talents necessary to get the job you want. Many animators are self-employed and work from home, but many others work in an office. Keep in mind that animators are sometimes required to put extra hours in or work through the weekend in order to meet deadlines."]},"id":"989ac083-a82e-448b-9cda-53ee603f4f92","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/qzEMA4TqLh5whze5gEBN9m.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/crazytalk-testing/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9YL1YvNzg2NTk1L29yaWdpbmFsL0NyYXp5VGFsazYtRWRpdGVkLmpwZw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qzEMA4TqLh5whze5gEBN9m.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"qzEMA4TqLh5whze5gEBN9m","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qzEMA4TqLh5whze5gEBN9m.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e2ef8179-eae6-4947-8061-34d4bc860e33","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Artist Tips<br/></strong>We asked Hanby where he finds inspiration when creating new characters. He told us that he believes &#34;all inspiration comes from your own experiences and what you choose to immerse yourself in.&#34; That can include the shows you watch, the music you listen to, the books you read or even the games you play. He added, &#34;Your personal experiences are unique and you can merge or combine pieces of various things together to form a new character or idea.&#34;","You can find plenty of additional drawing and animation tips online from artists. Additionally, the developers of most animations programs offer tutorials and online courses for you to learn from. If you aspire to improve your drawing and animation skills, you shouldn&#39;t be put off by your first drawing attempts. As an artist, I don&#39;t know how many times someone has told me something to the effect of, &#34;I can&#39;t even draw stick figures.&#34; Drawing, illustrating and animation are all about adding layers. You start with a basic shape and then you tweak it or add more details to it until you create something you like. If you don&#39;t like the way your creations look, change it and keep trying.","It also helps to take a break from your art for 10 minutes or more and then to come back to it with fresh eyes. You might notice an obvious flaw or perception issue that you hadn&#39;t seen previously. When we asked Hanby if he had any additional tips, he told us to always have a sketchbook on you and draw from life frequently. He further said, &#34;If you want to show people your art, have two sketchbooks. One for showing off and one for practicing and working on your skills. Take figure drawing courses or find figure drawing sessions you can attend. Create your own style and develop it.&#34; Learning from life will help you develop an eye for believable body movements and a better understanding of the human figure so you can incorporate those skills into your animations.","<br/><strong>More Guides for Animators and Filmmakers:</strong>"]},"id":"d04b2b67-f651-4b77-b3cf-41f16a7c7fca","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-graphic-design-software\">The Best Graphic Design Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-comic-book-software\">The Best Comic Book (or Storyboard) Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-video-editing-software\">The Best Video Editing Software</a>","<a href=\"/best-professional-video-editing-software\">The Best Professional Video Editing Software</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"0918e830-0286-4bb9-97d6-6a417daf9242","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"4ea0bfe5-b94b-42ac-bc5d-9498c007cb9e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/anime-studio-review\">MOHO Debut (Anime Studio)</a>","<a href=\"/toon-boom-studio-review\">Toon Boom Harmony Advanced -
