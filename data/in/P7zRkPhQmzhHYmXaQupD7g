You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.","After a brief discontinuation, Amazon has resurrected its oversized eReader, the Kindle DX. With a full QWERTY keyboard and 9.7-inch e-ink screen, this niche <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eBook reader</a> isn’t for everyone, but professionals, students and serious readers may like what they see.","This super-sized Kindle is more like a tablet in terms of design and size. At nearly 19 ounces, it weighs triple what most electronic book readers do and its expansive screen and full keyboard account for its rather large dimensions. Despite its size, it retains the trademark E-ink screen of a dedicated eReader with the same readability as printed paper. This enables you to read in direct sunlight and other bright environments with no glare.","Adding to potential issues that hinder this eReader is its less-than-stellar battery life. Depending on your usage, battery life of the Kindle DX can range from two to three weeks. This is way more usage than you would get from a single charge on a tablet with an LCD screen, but it’s noticeably subpar compared to other eBook readers, which can last between one and two months.","While portability is clearly not the DX’s strong suit, the device has some notable advantages over its compact competitors. Free 3G wireless lets you download content from the Kindle Store anytime, anywhere. Additionally, the 4GB of internal storage can hold approximately 3,500 titles. It may seem unlikely that you would ever reach that maximum but the Kindle DX is the ideal reading device for your own documents, so the extra capacity might be handy. Another cool feature of this eReader is it automatically detects its orientation and rotates the screen accordingly, ideal for reading documents and PDF files (which it directly supports). Not many devices in our eReader comparison offer this versatile viewing option, let alone an auto-rotating screen."]},"id":"045fc200-14a4-47ff-96ef-f66d1ebaeb80","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"49f6c47a-827e-49c7-9aac-e00f3ed599b4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kindle DX isn’t the right device for every reader; it’s bulky and one of the least portable eReaders on the market.
