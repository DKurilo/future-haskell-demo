Even as a single band adapter, the device has the ability to multitask transmitting data at speeds as fast a 150Mbps. Admittedly, we find it a bit incongruous that the manufacturer offers a 300Mbps wireless router while limiting the speed of the adapter to half that, but it’s still fast enough to be more than adequate for most users and, under ideal situations.","The most unique feature of the device is its external antenna. The wireless n standard in general does an excellent job of reducing or eliminating dead spots due to its MIMO, Multiple-input/Multiple-output, technology, which reuses deflected signals, but the narrow, adjustable beam of the hi-gain antenna can improve on that performance. That is particularly true if there is a specific obstacle, such as a masonry wall, that unduly blocks the wireless radio signal. The antenna is also removable and can be replaced by a number of different antennas from the manufacturer for special circumstances. It can even be coupled with an outdoor antenna that could be used to interface with a wireless network in a different building.","The HWUN3 has the capability of streaming high definition audio and video as well as voice applications like VoIP telephone calls and video calls. It is, nonetheless, less well suited for this sort of demanding network traffic than are adapters which include the 5GHz frequency range. The 2.4GHz band that it uses is simply less capable of handling the traffic and is more susceptible to interference from other devices.","Though the issue may not come up often for most users, the fact that theoretical data throughput is limited to 150Mbps as opposed to 300Mbps for more highly rated devices is a potential drawback. This is most likely to occur when multitasking and using applications that require particularly broad bandwidth."]},"id":"523d26cb-6ad5-4792-b8b7-203e70a5b771","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Security"},"id":"3182b872-f6d9-4f35-84af-de3a146004f0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Security vulnerabilities are well addressed by the Hawking wireless adapter. In addition to the Wired Equivalent Privacy protocol that has been around since the first generation of Wi-Fi devices and is now considered a good foundation but inadequate by itself, the adapter provides two levels of Wi-Fi Protected Access, WPA and WPA2. WPA incorporates TKIP, or Temporal Key Integrity Protocol to make communications over a wireless network private. WPA2 adds the Pre-shared key functionality which requires entry of a pass phrase in order to access the personal network. More importantly, WPA2 utilizes Advanced Encryption Standard, AES, which is widely used by government and industry to protect sensitive information.","Missing from the device’s feature set is an option called Wi-Fi Protected Setup. Most devices in this review offer this feature which makes securely establishing a connection between adapter and wireless router simply a matter of pushing a couple of buttons."]},"id":"8d7b21c6-79d7-4e80-b682-3e401bd21b62","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"03962081-17ac-4d2d-88b8-237552fbdf6c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Lack of the WPS feature, mentioned above, is a drawback for the Hawking adapter with regard to ease of use.
