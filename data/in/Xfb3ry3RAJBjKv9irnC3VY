You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","For yards 0.33 acres or smaller, the LawnBott LB75DX <a href=\"/best-robot-lawn-mowers\">automatic lawn mower</a> automatically cuts grass several times a week to keep lawns at a desired height. Scheduling the mower is done solely through the base unit. A Bluetooth receiver card or access through the LawnBott app is an option that you can add at time of purchase to make scheduling and setup easier.","Multizone capability is included for up to three zones, each up to 0.33 acres. Perimeter wire is not included for the extra zones, but you can purchase it separately. The LB75DX is suitable for most terrains as it can navigate itself up slopes and hills of an incline of up to 28 degrees, and it comes with double-row drive wheels that provide it with extra traction for areas that need it. This device is also is able to detect when it is stuck in a hole and then free itself through movement in order to resume its work.","The LawnBott LB75DX is powered with two lithium-ion batteries, giving it a working time of 90 minutes. If the automatic lawn mower needs to recharge before completing its task, it will automatically return to its base to recharge and then return to finish the lawn. A full charge takes approximately two hours. Batteries last four to five years and are costly to replace. Having to replace two batteries makes it even more expensive; however, with such a long lifespan, the batteries provide good value.","Cutting with a four-sided star blade, it cuts widths of 10 inches, and the cutting height can be set from 0.75 to 2.8 inches. For an evenly cut lawn, setting the mower in spiral mode is an option. While in this mode, the robot lawn mower will begin mowing in the center of the high grass areas and work its way outward. If rain is detected, the rain sensor on the LB75DX will alert it to stop mowing and return it to its charging station. Once the rain has stopped, it will return to its work.","Electric motors allow the mower to run quiet enough to run at night, with sound emanating up to 20 feet away. The motors are brushed motors, which are the conventional motors used with most nonautomated lawn mowers. Compared to brushless motors, these motors use more power and do not have as long a life span.","For smaller lawns, the LawnBott LB75DX is an appropriate fit. Features such as the higher slope climbing ability, multizone capability, high traction wheels and anti-stuck technology make it well suited for nearly any terrain. Adding the optional wireless accessibility makes this robot lawn mower a complete top-tier package and makes scheduling it easier."]},"id":"0c3d795f-2afc-4732-a7ca-8e296da16280","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63704","url":"/lawnbott-lb75dx-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"danny-chadwick","url":"/author/danny-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Danny Chadwick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"DhF8Hg8QQde8MtLyq8X8JN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-25T21:09:56Z","datePublished":"2015-03-25T21:09:56Z","name":"LawnBott LB75DX","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-25T21:09:56Z","id":"Xfb3ry3RAJBjKv9irnC3VY","meta":{"title":"LawnBott LB75DX Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The LawnBott LB75DX tobot lawn mower automatically cuts grass several times a week at your desired height for yards 0.33 acres or smaller."},"products":[{"slug":"lawnbott-lb75dx","url":"/product/lawnbott-lb75dx","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:13Z","name":"LawnBott LB75DX","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:13Z","id":"E56fgsjBHvDBYdcWqLPeTC","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:16:13Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/FobbC34KBKY5vzawnBxTEM.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:13Z","mimeType":"","name":"63676-lawnbott-lb75dx-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63676-lawnbott-lb75dx-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:13Z","id":"FobbC34KBKY5vzawnBxTEM","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FobbC34KBKY5vzawnBxTEM.jpg","alt":""},"title":"LawnBott LB75DX Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The LawnBott LB75DX tobot lawn mower automatically cuts grass several times a week at your desired height for yards 0.33 acres or smaller."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/FobbC34KBKY5vzawnBxTEM.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:13Z","mimeType":"","name":"63676-lawnbott-lb75dx-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63676-lawnbott-lb75dx-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:13Z","id":"FobbC34KBKY5vzawnBxTEM","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FobbC34KBKY5vzawnBxTEM.jpg","alt":""},"title":"LawnBott LB75DX Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The LawnBott LB75DX tobot lawn mower automatically cuts grass several times a week at your desired height for yards 0.33 acres or smaller."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/outdoor/best-robot-lawn-mowers/lawnbott-lb75dx-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:13Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:13Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"lawn-mowers","url":"/home-and-garden/lawn-mowers","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:13Z","name":"Lawn Mowers","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:13Z","id":"smr57URmWPEAAvpHn7aR9h","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
