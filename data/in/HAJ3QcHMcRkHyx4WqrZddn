However, it does offer separate black/white and color ink cartridges which will also help you to save a few bucks. The black and white cartridge offers laser-quality text printing, while the color cartridge creates great looking photos. Both cartridges are easy to replace in this all-in-one printer.","The auto document feeder allows you to scan, copy or fax up to 30 pages at one time. On the incoming side of things, this printer will accept a vast —250 pages of an incoming fax. The super G3 high-speed fax can also accommodate up to 20 different coded speed-dial numbers for added efficiency.","Are you concerned about the sensitive information that some faxes may contain? Let the Canon Pixma MX330 ease your fears. It offers several security features, including the ability to password protect your PDF files.","Interested in printing high quality photos? This all-in-one printer includes Auto Image Fix. This technology automatically categorizes your image into one of five different categories and then provides peak image correction, so your photos come out crystal clear every time.","Are you tired of having to wait for your printer to warm up each time you turn it on? With the Canon Pixma MX330, the wait time is now shorter than ever. Once you hit the power button, you can begin printing within two seconds. This is a definite improvement over the five minutes it used to take printers to warm up before being able to print.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"f47fca54-27b4-47be-85e5-2a39fd59478b","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Are you still paying off student loans?
