Among our 10 favorite <a href=\"/best-electric-razors\">electric razors</a>, it’s our best value pick. Both this shaver and the <a href=\"/wahl-shaver-review\">Wahl LifeProof 7061-100</a> (our pick for best overall) have MSRPs of $69.99, making them the most affordable razors we tested.","In contrast, the most expensive razor in our lineup, the <a href=\"/braun-review\">Braun Series 7 790cc-4</a>, has an MSRP of $229.99. While the Braun Series 7 outperformed the Remington F8 in our testing, the functional differences between the two are not as substantial as their price difference.","This razor’s battery provides 60 minutes of shaving time on a full charge – 10 minutes more than the Braun’s. A full charge takes 90 minutes, but there’s a five-minute quick-charge feature that will give you enough power for a single shave if you don’t have time to wait. This is an important convenience because the Remington F8 doesn’t have a corded-use option. If you’re looking for a razor you can use while it’s charging, the Panasonic and Braun models we tested have this capability.","Like each of the razors we reviewed, the WETech is waterproof and can be used wet or dry. It works well with shaving foam and is safe for use in the shower. It also has an advanced intercept trimmer to pre-trim longer whiskers as you maneuver it over your face and neck, and its shaving foils pivot and flex with the contours of your face.","“Although it is sort of loud, it gave me a clean shave rather quickly,” said one of our testers, who traditionally uses an electric razor daily.","However, one tester who typically prefers manual razors felt like it left behind some stubble.","“It took too many passes to get a close shave,” he said. “I tend to shave only once a week, and I had to go over areas with more hair growth six to eight times.”","In terms of features and accessories, the Remington F8 doesn’t have a travel lock or a storage/travel pouch. If you are a regular traveler, you may find the <a href=\"/panasonic-arc4-review-review\">Panasonic Arc4 ES-LA93-K</a> and <a href=\"/panasonic-arc5-review\">Panasonic Arc5 ES-LV65-S</a> more to your liking. While the Remington F8 come with a cleaning station, our testers reported that it’s easy to clean. The manufacturer’s instructions are detailed and provide guidelines for both daily cleaning and periodic maintenance.","“It takes slightly longer to do all the brushing out of the nooks and crannies and then rinse it under the faucet,” one tester told us, “but I was able to get the razor considerably cleaner.”","Remington warranties the F8 WETech for two years, which is standard among the electric razors we reviewed. During multiple interactions with the company’s consumer support team, we experienced first-rate customer service."]},"id":"6dcfbc90-f592-43f3-b16a-8e6e4cd21b6c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70228","url":"/remington-f8-wetech-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-11T18:31:32Z","datePublished":"2018-09-11T18:31:32Z","name":"Remington F8 WETech","synopsis":"The Remington F8 WETech has a flex foil cutting system with stainless steel blades.
