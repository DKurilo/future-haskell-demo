You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Sony offers a large selection of <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">DVD players</a>, with or without Blu-ray support, for any budget. Select models that are well-suited to the budget-conscious consumer play DVDs, and some also play CDs. Midrange and high-end players support Blu-ray playback. Remember to check region compatibility, although many of Sony’s devices are region-free. You can also stream on demand via a broadband connection or stream content via Bluetooth with select Sony DVD and Blu-ray players.","Connectivity varies between models. Basic DVD players offer HDMI or SCART connections, while others have a more diverse range of inputs and outputs, giving you plenty of options for your home theater setup. You can get a Sony DVD player with one or two HDMI, optical digital and AV analog ports, which gives you enough ports and versatility to connect all of your existing entertainment equipment, including older pieces that require analog ports.","Not every Sony DVD player connects to the internet, but those that do may offer Ethernet-only connectivity or both wireless and Ethernet options. If your player does go online, you’ll most likely find it offers a variety of native apps that let you stream from services like Netflix. Some Sony products also let you stream games from the company&#39;s cloud service, provided you have a PlayStation DualShock controller and a PlayStation Now subscription. A USB port lets you connect peripherals and USB storage devices, while a local wireless network lets you share content between multiple devices for convenient entertainment.","Most budget-friendly models offer near-HD or 720p HD, while midrange and high-end options provide enhanced image quality, including 1080p Full HD and Ultra HD. Select models also support 3D playback. Most Sony DVD players offer upscaling, converting low-resolution DVDs into near-HD quality, or 730p HD into 1080p or Ultra HD quality.","Many Sony DVD and Blu-ray players support high-resolution audio playback, making them a popular choice for consumers with large audio libraries. Most Sony models are compatible with the Sony TV SideView app, so you can control your chosen player from your smartphone. Screen mirroring is also an option on select players, letting you view and share the contents of your smartphone on your television. Web browsing, social media and streaming apps are all available on midrange and high-end DVD players from Sony."]},"id":"541229ad-4dac-44e6-8372-ca08a092a6ad","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53442","url":"/sony-dvp-sr500h-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-16T18:32:24Z","datePublished":"2011-08-16T18:32:24Z","name":"Sony","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-08-16T18:32:24Z","id":"rGxCZbbEop3EMhNKMXvF4a","meta":{"title":"Sony Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Sony DVD players are reliable, durable and easy to use.
