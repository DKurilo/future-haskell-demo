NeatConnect takes another approach. It has multiple slots that fit different size cards and paper, so they scan straighter and truer from the get-go than with many of machine’s competitors. In our tests, the NeatConnect scanned very thin and sometimes grease stained and creased paper, such as food receipts, especially well when compared to other scanners.","This sheet-fed desktop scanner is among the smallest we reviewed. Without the trays extended, the NeatConnect has a desk footprint of 11 x 8.7 inches. The automatic document feeder (ADF) holds 50 sheets of paper and scans at a speedy 24 pages a minute. Because the machine is light − just over 5 pounds − it’s very portable and can be used in places where space is limited. This makes it ideal for a work area like a reception desk, where customers are handing over credit cards, checks and personal paperwork.","You can choose single- or double-sided scanning from the front touchpad, and the scanner accepts paper in letter, A4 and legal size, as well as rolls up to 30 inches long. Since it can scan long rolls, it is great for medical test papers, receipts and adding machine tape that seems to go on forever. Business cards, embossed credit cards and laminated driver’s licenses also go through the machine with ease."]},"id":"1950c33a-2854-4117-be2d-946c8daee31c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"c8c345c8-b3e8-4515-a207-9d2cd28843df","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/XpBdhQKxZVLPsqEEDzJjBh.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The wireless NeatConnect can send scans to many online applications and repositories, including Microsoft Word, Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote and OneNote.
