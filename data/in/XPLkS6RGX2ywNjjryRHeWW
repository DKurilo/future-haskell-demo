some parts of the U.S., high humidity levels in a home at certain times of the year can wreak havoc on your home, possessions and health. The Comfort-Aire BHD701H <a href=\"/best-dehumidifiers\">dehumidifier</a> removes up to 70 pints of moisture from the air in a 2,500-square foot area, making it one of the best dehumidifiers on our review and an excellent choice for use as a dehumidifier for your entire house.","The water-collection reservoir of this home dehumidifier holds 12.7 pints, which is quite smaller than comparably sized dehumidifiers, like the <a href=\"/haier-70-pint-review\">Haier HM70EP</a>, meaning you will empty the bucket often. There is a view window on the water reservoir so you can keep an eye on the amount of water in the collection bucket. There is also an indicator light that flashes on the digital display when the bucket is full. If you&#39;re away from home when the reservoir needs to be emptied, the Comfort-Aire BHD701H  automatically shuts off.","This Comfort-Aire dehumidifier has a continual drain feature. When a hose is connected to the outlet on the back of the unit, you can bypass the collection bucket altogether. There is also a drain pump, which allows you to leave the unit on the floor and thread the drain hose out a nearby window or into a sink.","Another handy feature, one that is especially useful for chilly basements, storage areas or garages is auto defrost. The Comfort-Aire can withstand temperatures as low as 41 degrees Fahrenheit and automatically defrosts itself to prevent the unit from freezing and breaking.","This is a somewhat noisy dehumidifier. We measured the decibel level of each of the dehumidifiers we evaluated. The Comfort-Aire produces 58.3 decibels when it&#39;s in use. That level of sound is equivalent to the noise produced by an air conditioning unit. This is another reason why this dehumidifier is best suited for basements.","The Comfort-Aire BHD701H home dehumidifier comes with a standard one-year warranty for parts and replacement, subject to normal use. You also get a five-year warranty for the sealed system, which includes the compressor and coils.","One drawback of the Comfort-Aire BHD701H is its lack of customer support options. There isn&#39;t an online user manual, nor will you find an email address or phone number that&#39;s conveniently listed for the company. There are ways to reach a representative that you can find in the user manual that comes with the unit, so you&#39;ll want to retain the manual."]},"id":"9263f6c5-d86e-4575-80b3-878d83ae8076","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d5f8411a-8772-4e18-a47e-1ba0fa5c095d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Comfort-Aire&#39;s dehumidifier makes your home more comfortable and safer by removing excess moisture from the air.
