This <a href=\"/best-pasta-makers\">pasta maker</a> makes spaghetti and fettuccine. Other types of pasta require you to purchase attachments for the appliance.","This machine is a solid metal piece. It has a chrome-plated steel finish, which gives off a shine. The unattached components included are the double cutter for making spaghetti or fettuccine and the table clamp to secure the appliance to your kitchen counter. Both of these features are also chrome-plated steel. The only part of the pasta machine that is not metal is the wood handle that you turn to roll the pasta through the cutter.","The double cutter accessory has two size settings: 1/16 inch for spaghetti and 1/4 inch for fettuccine. This allows you to choose the width of the pasta noodles. If you want to cut your own pasta or want a sheet of it for lasagna, then you can remove the cutter. The roller that pushes and flattens the dough as it goes through the Imperia pasta maker is 6 inches wide. It cannot make a sheet of pasta wider than this.","Rolling dough through this pasta maker machine does not require much force. The design of the wooden grip on the handle aims to be comfortable in your hand, especially as you are turning it. The adjustment dial mechanism affects the thickness of the pasta sheet. If you don&#39;t like, or can&#39;t handle, hand cranking a pasta maker, try the <a href=\"/philips-review\">Philips Avance Collection Pasta Maker</a> that is an all-electric model.","The Imperia Pasta Machine has many other attachments that are not included with the initial purchase. These add-ons let you create more pasta shapes than just spaghetti and fettuccine. Another accessory replaces the wooden handle with an electric motor. This eliminates the need for clamping the device to the counter. When the device clamps, you need the edge of a counter or table to secure it. The electric motor allows you to move the appliance anywhere because you do not need to clamp it. These additions can cost as much as the pasta maker itself.","A recipe book is included with the machine. This booklet aids anyone who is new to making pasta. When it comes time to clean your appliance, Imperia recommends only using a dry cloth and a soft brush. All of the attachments need cleaning after use.","The CucinaPro Imperia Pasta Maker is an Italian-made appliance capable of creating sheets of pasta, spaghetti and fettuccine. However, it only makes a couple types of pasta, and you must secure it to the edge of the counter, unless you purchase other attachments."]},"id":"ff986e62-0fb1-4bdc-b217-9ef7c5e0422c","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64718","url":"/cucinapro-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-07T18:12:35Z","datePublished":"2015-05-07T18:12:35Z","name":"CucinaPro Imperia","synopsis":"The CucinaPro Imperia Pasta Machine allows you to turn dough into sheets of pasta.
