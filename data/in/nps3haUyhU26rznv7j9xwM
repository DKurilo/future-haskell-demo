You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","Infinity is a respected brand of audio equipment, known for high-quality sound. The Infinity Primus PC350 center channel speaker upholds the brand name. This center speaker may be substantially heavier than the Yamaha NS-C310, but the 3-way system design is superior to the 2-way design of the Polk Audio TSi CS10. A well-made center speaker, like this one, ensures that you can clearly hear all of the dialogue in a movie or lyrics of a song. It is because of the first-rate design and the excellent audio quality that we found this to be one of the best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1286-best-center-speakers.html\">center speakers</a> in our review."]},"id":"f9cc9d44-921a-4aad-b99c-5de27434ca4b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"8253df5e-e064-4528-b8aa-c5cd8d41915b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Infinity Primus PC350 uses magnetic shielding to prevent any interference. Sometimes the magnet that is used in center speakers can disrupt surrounding electronic equipment. The image of a standard Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) television, for example, may become distorted or blurry if the magnetic field of a nearby audio device is not shielded. However, this type of magnetism does not affect LCD or plasma televisions.","Audio equipment can only handle a certain amount of power before it becomes overloaded and overheats. This center channel speaker has a recommended power range of 10 to 150 watts. Anything below 10 watts may not produce enough sound, and anything above 150 watts can permanently damage the drivers.","This 3-way center speaker divides the audio signals among five different loudspeakers. Low tones are sent to dual 5.25-inch Metal Matrix Diaphragm (MMD) woofers. The Metal Matrix Diaphragm is unique to Infinity products and features an anodized aluminum core. These MMD drivers have a sturdy, yet flexible design which enables them to vibrate at high speeds, reproducing high-fidelity sound.","Dual 3-inch MMD midrange drivers handle the middle frequencies. Giving midrange frequencies their own driver allows the sound to come through more accurately. This allows the tweeter and the woofer to produce high and low frequencies, respectively, without interruption or interference. Having a third driver helps improve the audio quality of your center speaker.","As previously mentioned, the single 0.75-inch MMD tweeter is responsible for the high-pitched frequencies. Generally, sounds above a frequency of 2,000 Hz are sent to this loudspeaker. Though smaller than some of the other high-frequency drivers we found in our review, this tweeter is still capable of hitting the high notes."]},"id":"91b836d9-e223-46da-82a1-65fae68b38e2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"c3bf18fe-0023-4731-aed8-82b8a4a4ddca","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Though it only measures 7.4 inches high, 23.9 inches wide and 9.25 inches deep, the Infinity Primus PC350 weighs 25 pounds. That is heavier than any other center speaker in our review. It may not take up much space, but it will have a hard time balancing on top of your television and it would be a pain to move around the room. In comparison, the 2-way <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1286-best-center-speakers.html\">Infinity Primus C250</a> center speaker only weighs 17.6 pounds and the other 3-way model in our review, the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1286-best-center-speakers.html\">Polk Audio CSi A4</a>, only weighs 15.5 pounds.

The crossover frequency is the point at which an audio signal is split up. The separate signals are then sent to the coordinating driver. Higher frequencies are sent to the tweeters, low tones are sent to the woofers and everything in between is sent to the midrange drivers. This separation helps reduce strain on the various drivers because they don&#39;t have to try to reproduce sounds out of their range.","Sensitivity is a measurement of how much energy is required to play your audio device. Products that have a high sensitivity rating require less power to produce a given volume level than those with a low sensitivity rating. In addition, a high sensitivity level means that you won&#39;t hear hissing or static when listening to high volume levels. This center speaker has a sensitivity of 91dB, which is one of the highest ratings in our review.","Since this center speaker has a nominal impedance of 8 ohms, you&#39;ll need to make sure that your receiver&#39;s rating is equal to or less than 8 ohms. Impedance indicates a piece of audio equipment&#39;s resistance to the current going into it. If the receiver is putting more power into the device than it can handle, it will quickly overheat, causing permanent damage.","The human ear can generally hear frequencies between 20Hz and 20kHz. This model has a frequency response of 80Hz to 20kHz. Lower frequencies are not as important in center channel speakers, because most of the low, rumbling tones will come from the subwoofer. However, this product will have no problem duplicating any high frequency tones that can be heard by the average ear. Nonetheless, it won&#39;t be able to produce the supersonic sounds that are sometimes used to enhance audio in film."]},"id":"df57cb7b-136b-46d4-a40e-d2b380c2ec1d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"cb09c26b-8a90-4cd8-85ec-f8ec2f654a08","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Infinity&#39;s site offers a variety of helpful options for the Infinity Primus PC350.
