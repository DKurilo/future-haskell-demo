This <a href=\"/best-hair-dryers\">blow dryer</a> uses less electricity than a standard blow dryer and contains a powerful AC motor. In addition, this device has several design benefits, including a long power cord. However, this Barbar hair dryer is relatively heavy and does not offer any features or tools that help it stand out when compared to similar products.","This hair dryer got the lowest score from our testers. They noted that the heat and drying settings were not labeled on the Barbar Eco&#39;s handle, which made it challenging to adjust speed and temperature. This professional blow dryer&#39;s 1,800 watts of power and low air speeds worked well for our testers with fine or curly hair, but it was not powerful enough to satisfy our thick-haired testers.","Barbar claims this blow dryer uses 40 percent less electricity than a standard hair dryer. We measured the lowest temperature of this hair dryer at 77 degrees and the highest temperature at 136 degrees, which is really low compared to the other hair dryer brands on our review. This temperature difference may account for some of the lower energy usage.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"0ce3014a-35d3-4f82-afe4-abba7ed92224","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There are two concentrator nozzles included with this blow dryer.
