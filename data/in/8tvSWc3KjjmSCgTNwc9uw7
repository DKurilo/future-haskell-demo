F22"},"id":"97961e10-7000-4586-89f0-326b9e618d20","type":"heading"},{"data":{"text":"Introduction"},"id":"c7c80d63-7f00-4761-a629-50eddce48ff6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This <a href=\"/best-metal-detectors\">metal detector</a> has a 9-inch triangulated elliptical concentric coil. This means it can find objects as deep as 9 inches underground, about average compared to other metal detectors in our lineup, some of which can search as deep as 11 inches. Concentric searchcoils have a cone-shaped search field that is wider at the surface of the ground and narrows to a point 9 inches deep, so it’s not ideal for finding deeper treasures.","The F22 has 10 levels of sensitivity you can adjust if you’re experiencing a lot of feedback or not picking anything up at all. The factory setting was 6 and we didn’t have to adjust it at all during our tests. You can also use the notch feature on this metal detector, which allows you to exclude the metal of your choosing from your search simply by pressing a few buttons on the face of the screen. You can also simply select a mode for your hunt, choosing between jewelry, coins, artifacts or a custom setting you can set up to your liking. ","While some metal detectors note on the screen whether a found object might be a nickel, soda can pull-tab or various other commonly found objects, the F22 only notes whether an object is near the conductivity range of gold, silver or iron. A target ID number is also displayed, which corresponds to a metal’s conductivity as well. Pinpoint mode is available on a centralized location on the screen, which can be used to get an even more accurate reading of what the F22 has picked up beneath the surface. In our tests, the F22 found 46 percent of the objects we buried. It also correctly identified every one of those objects, something we were really impressed by.","This metal detector displays depth via three notches on the screen. One notch means the object is about 3 inches underground, two notches means it’s around 6 inches deep and three notches means the metal is buried deeper than 6 inches. The instruction manual notes this measures the “relative” depth of a buried object. In our tests, the F22 had an accurate depth reading 21 percent of the time with most of those readings occurring when objects were buried 2 or 6 inches deep.","The F22 is unique in that it’s powered by two AA batteries. Most of the metal detectors we tested aside from the <a href=\"/garrett-ace-metal-detector-review\">Garrett Ace 400</a> run on 9-volt batteries, but the difference doesn’t appear to affect battery life at all. Users should expect to get 25-30 hours of treasure hunting from two fully charged batteries, which is comparable to detectors that run on a 9-volt. It also comes with a rather substantial five-year warranty from Fisher. You can also control the volume of the detector’s beeping.","This metal detector, like most in our lineup including the <a href=\"/fisher-metal-detector-review\">Fisher F44,</a> was relatively easy to assemble. A Phillips screwdriver is, however, required to attach the monitor to the shaft of the detector. Once assembled, the F22 weighs 2.3 pounds, making it one of the lightest we tested. Having a light metal detector is important to minimize arm fatigue. Users should also note while the searchcoil is waterproof, this metal detector is not for underwater use and shouldn’t be submerged.","The Fisher F22 is a good weatherproof metal detector that doesn’t require a hood for the display if you’re out in the rain, but the accuracy and the difficulty of use are concerns. It performed below average in every part of our tests, and its reliance on numerical target IDs means that you have a learning curve to overcome before you know what any of the numbers mean."]},"id":"745256e5-5524-47db-8698-7c195376d266","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69318","url":"/fisher-f22-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-17T20:09:36Z","datePublished":"2017-05-17T20:09:36Z","name":"Fisher F22","synopsis":"This metal detector has a 9-inch triangulated elliptical concentric coil.
