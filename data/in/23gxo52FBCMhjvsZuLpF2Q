in Japan in 1931, Bridgestone hasn&#39;t been around nearly as long as most <a href=\"/home/auto/best-tires\">tire brands</a>, many of which started manufacturing tires in the 1870&#39;s. Still, despite the relative youth in the market, Bridgestone has established itself as one of the largest and most trusted tire brands. That said, the average tread-life warranties and limited performance options don&#39;t make up for the high average prices.","In my comparison of common tires sizes for sedans, Bridgestone&#39;s average price was $123 per tire. While this wasn&#39;t nearly as expensive as the <a href=\"/michelin-ltx-review\">Michelin</a> tires of the same size, it&#39;s far above the market average of $102 per tire. <a href=\"/cooper-discoverer-a-t3-review\">Cooper</a>, for example, is priced at an average of $73 per tire for the same size. The SUV tires were also expensive at an average of about $195 per tire. The truck tires were the most competitively prices at an average of $226 per tire, but this was still about $23 over the market average.","The tread-life warranty covers 22 tire series. The best warranty covers the Dueler H/K Alenza Plus (H Speed) and the Turanza Serentity Plus with an expected lifespan of about 80,000 miles. By comparison, the best brands have tread-life mileage as high as 100,000 miles. The average tread-life mileage is 56,000 miles, which is right in line with the market average. To put it simply, this tire brands&#39; tread-life warranties are very average. It&#39;s certainly doesn&#39;t help make the higher prices more attractive.","Similar to most tire brands, the performance options are lacking, especially compared to <a href=\"/goodyear-assurance-tripletred-all-season-review\">Goodyear</a>. Bridgestone averages three options for the common 15-inch rim sizes, eight options for the 16-inch rims and four options for the 17-inch rims. By comparison, Goodyear average eight options on the 15-inch rim, 16 options on the 16-inch rim and 13 options on the 17-inch rim. In addition, the truck tires averaged just three options per size compared with Goodyear&#39;s 11 options.","<strong>Summary</strong><br/>Bridgestone may not have the most tire options for popular sedan tire sizes, but the tread-life warranties are great for SUVs and trucks. However, the price puts this tire brand more into the premium level of tires."]},"id":"b316180d-7af7-424e-be27-9f51a0d5917f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67972","url":"/bridgestone-blizzak-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-13T17:39:28Z","datePublished":"2016-06-13T17:39:28Z","name":"Bridgestone","synopsis":"Founded in Japan in 1931, Bridgestone hasn't been around nearly as long as most tire brands, many of which started manufacturing tires in the 1870's.
