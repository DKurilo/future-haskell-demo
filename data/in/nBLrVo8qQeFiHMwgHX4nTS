You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Frigidaire FFEF3015 comes with two 8-inch and two 6-inch coil-style burners on the <a href=\"/best-electric-cooktop-ranges\">cooktop range</a>, a digital timer and clock, as well as push-button controls for the oven temperature. You control the range temperatures with plastic knobs that can come off to make cleaning easier.","One of the best features of this electric oven is that it comes equipped with an auto-off feature. This means that if someone forgets to turn off the oven for more than 12 hours, it will automatically turn itself off. This feature is especially important for people who might forget to turn off the oven.","The oven is a spacious 5.3 cubic feet that comes with two oven racks that you can adjust to six different levels. Having this many positions available offers you more freedom. If you are cooking something large, such as a turkey, you can remove one of the racks and use the lowest position to ensure that the bird will fit nicely in the oven. However, if you are baking a frozen pizza, you should place a rack in an upper position to ensure that the cheese melts evenly.","The Frigidaire FFEF3015 comes with an oven lockout feature that can be useful if you have small children in the house. This allows you to lock the control pads so that no one will be able to turn on the oven. To engage this feature, all you have to do is press and hold a specific button and you will know your children are safe.","While this electric cooktop has all the basic functions you would expect from high-quality ranges, it does lack some high-end features found in the best electric stoves, such as a keep-warm setting and a high-wattage bake range. A keep-warm setting is convenient as it allows you to use the range to cook other dishes or sauces while keeping your main dish warm in the oven.","The Frigidaire FFEF3015 has a capable baking heating element that can pull up to 2,600 watts. This is an average amount, but the best ranges can pull up to 1,000 watts more to deliver more consistent and higher temperatures, which is essential to cook your food evenly.","Some kitchen chores are worse than others are. Having to scrub a dirty oven ranks high on that list. Thankfully, this electric range has an oven with a self-cleaning cycle. The oven uses extremely high temperatures to burn any stuck-on items to ashes, leaving a small pile of rubbish to wipe away when the cleaning cycle is finished. This simple process can take off hours of scrubbing."]},"id":"6453cd00-e13e-45c5-a265-e3ee4d497110","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ccdff4b4-6b7a-43fd-8486-14514e0edec0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Frigidaire FFEF3015 is a standard oven with a few features found on the best electric stoves, and it is quite capable of making a great meal whether you use the cooktop or the 5.3-cubic-foot oven.
