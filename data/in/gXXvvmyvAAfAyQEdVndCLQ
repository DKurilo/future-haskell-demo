The buttons follow the same color scheme and are backlit for easy dialing, even in the dark. The handset is larger than others we reviewed, so it’s not the sleekest or prettiest option. On the left side is a headset jack for hands-free talking. You can also use the handset speakerphone, but sound quality is better through the wired connection. There’s a dedicated call block button at the bottom right of the keypad for easily evading telemarketers. You can block up to 250 numbers with this feature if you subscribe to a caller ID service from your phone company.

It displays caller ID numbers if you subscribe to that service from your phone company, and it supports call waiting so you’ll never miss a call.

While the LCD screen is easy-to read, the buttons aren’t designed for low lit environments. <br />\n  <br />\nWhat sets this phone apart from other cordless phones we reviewed is its cell phone integration. Panasonic’s Link2Cell feature allows you to connect two cell phones to the system via Bluetooth. This allows you to make and answer cellular calls on your cordless handsets, which can be useful if, for example, you’re charging your smartphone in another room. The base of this Panasonic phone also has a USB port so you can charge your mobile phone too. You can set up text message alerts so your handsets let you know when you’ve received a message, and the cordless phone can forward your messages to a registered phone number to check your answering machine on the go. <br />\n <br />\nIf you want a cordless phone that keeps you connected, the Panasonic KX-TG7875S is the best feature-rich phone if you’re willing to invest the money.

There are simple phones that are great for emergencies, and complex systems that can make a great addition to a small business. Whatever you’re shopping for, these are some things to keep in mind.","Price<br/>A basic cordless phone can cost as little as $20, but features like an answering machine, talking caller ID and emergency backup power increase the price. For simply making and receiving calls, an inexpensive phone like the VTech CS6719 works perfectly. But if you want something nicer with ease-of-use features like a headset jack or Bluetooth connectivity, expect to pay more than $50.","Number of Handsets<br/>Most cordless phone systems are expandable, so you can have multiple handsets on a single line by connecting just the main base via telephone jack. Handsets come with your initial purchase, but you can buy individual accessory handsets to expand your system. The products we tested can have five to 12 total handsets. If you wanted, you can keep one in every room of your house. Extra handsets usually come with their own charging cradle.","Backup Power<br/>Phone lines still work when the power goes out, but many cordless phones lack any backup power features, making it impossible for you to make calls. If you have frequent power outages or if you don’t have a charged cell phone as a backup option in case of emergency, look for a phone that has an emergency backup battery.","Features and Settings<br/>Features like handset location, handset-to-handset intercom function, caller ID, backlit displays and speakerphone are standard across all the phones we tested. Other features, like a built-in answering machine, headset jack or talking caller ID can also be extremely useful, particularly for home offices. Phones like the Panasonic KX-TG7875S are packed with customizable features and settings, including cell phone integration and call blocking. These phones are great for business, but may be a bit too much for a humble home phone. When asked if he had any tips for choosing a phone, Bill Horne, industry veteran and moderator of The Telecom Digest, commented, “My advice has always been to avoid complexity.”","<strong>How Do Cordless Phones Work?</strong>","Cordless phone systems all follow a similar form factor: one main base connected to your telephone socket and one or more handsets that connect to the base wirelessly. Basically, cordless phones combine traditional telephone and radio technologies. The base acts as a transmitter/receiver and translator, sending and receiving signals send back and forth between the base, the handset and the phone line.","Most cordless phones, including all the ones we tested, now run on DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) 6.0 technology. The differences between this type of phone and others (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz phones) include better range, better sound quality and less interference, as it uses a frequency band specifically set aside for cordless phone use.","<strong>Landlines vs. Cell Phones</strong>","Most people in the United States do not have landlines, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/wireless201812.pdf\">this survey</a> by the National Center for Health Statistics. Mobile phones have replaced landlines over the past decade, and the trend continues, with more Americans living in mobile-only households each year. About 45 percent of adults still use a landline phone, so traditional phone service is far from obsolete. However, the country is becoming more mobile-oriented.","Cell phones have a few advantages over landlines, including mobility and accessibility. Most people who have landlines have cell phones as well, making the landline an added, unnecessary expense for many people. Even with cordless setups, landline phones are locked to their locations. Most people carry their cell phones with them so they don&#39;t miss important calls, messages, emails or news. And because smartphones continue to offer new conveniences, it often makes more sense to choose a smartphone over a landline.","Landlines, however, offer better reliability, especially in rural areas where cell service can be spotty. This reliability is especially important in emergency situations, as cellular location may not be accurate. Landline handsets can also be more comfortable for long calls. Many landline phones, including some of the products we reviewed, have features that play nicely with cell phones, including Bluetooth interfacing and message forwarding. These are great features if you don’t want to carry your smartphone with you when you’re home."]},"id":"e5455e15-3aed-41dc-97e4-ae77a16e1279","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"8681f500-f27c-470a-80bc-2761b542b176","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/panasonic-review\">Panasonic KX-TGE433B</a>","<a href=\"/panasonic-kx-review\">Panasonic KX-TGE445B</a>","<a href=\"/att-review\">AT&amp;T CRL32102</a>","<a href=\"/panasonic-kx-tg-review\">Panasonic KX-TG7875S</a>","<a href=\"/at-t-el52113-review\">AT&amp;T EL52113</a>","<a href=\"/vtech-review\">VTech CS6719</a>","<a href=\"/at-t-el51103-review\">VTech CS5119</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"be7ae394-8cc4-4c76-ab12-b984ad3fe5e7","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_100","url":"/best-cordless-phones","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-17T17:18:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-17T17:18:00Z","name":"Best Cordless Phones of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best cordless phones, ranked by their audio quality, battery life, ease of use and features (like voicemail recording time).","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best cordless phones, ranked by their audio quality, battery life, ease of use and features (like voicemail recording time).","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-02-06T19:52:56Z","id":"gXXvvmyvAAfAyQEdVndCLQ","meta":{"title":"Best Cordless Phones 2019 -
