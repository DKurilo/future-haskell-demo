It’s also built for safety with a lock to prevent children from turning on the stove on without your knowledge. Additionally, its wide power range allows you to simmer or sear foods easily.","This cooktop performs right on par with the best models we reviewed. There are four heat elements that range from 1,800 watts to 3,700 watts of power – the highest we saw on any induction cooker this size. The lower power settings are ideal for simmering foods, while the higher power is best for searing meats and boiling water. There’s even a melting setting, lower than simmer, that provides just enough heat to melt butter or chocolate without burning it. However, we are disappointed there is no power boost feature. This would provide even more power and further decrease cooking time.","This cooktop lets you set a separate built-in timer for each specific burner, allowing you to keep track of how long multiple dishes have been cooking simultaneously.","You can adjust the temperatures and settings with GE Profile&#39;s touch-sensitive controls; it’s as easy as touching the plus or minus prompts. The cooktop and controls have a clean, modern look.","The safety features on this cooktop met our full expectations. There’s a hot-surface indicator light for each heat element, so you know when it’s on. The cooktop can determine if a pan is correctly placed on the burner or if it has been removed. If a pan with induction cooking capabilities is not detected on an element, the burner automatically turns off after 25 seconds. There are additional control locks that, when activated, prevent all cooktop controls from operating.","The GE Profile PHP9030DJBB is a powerful induction cooktop with outstanding performance and a handful of  extra-useful features. The large power range allows you to melt butter without burning it and to sear and fry foods easily. We are also impressed with its ability to set a timer for each individual burner. We would like to see power boost capabilities to provide even more power, but even lacking that, is one of the best induction cooktops available."]},"id":"f381911e-8ca3-4d5b-b02b-bb22acaec7c0","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67041","url":"/ge-cafe-chp9530sjss-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-09-20T00:48:22Z","datePublished":"2015-09-20T00:48:22Z","name":"GE Profile PHP9030DJBB","synopsis":"The GE Cafe PHP9030DJBB induction cooker  includes touch-sensitive controls, a melt setting and a bridge element.","review":{"rating":78,"verdict":"The GE Profile PHP9030DJBB is not only one of the most powerful induction cooktops on our lineup, it also provides several visual options to ensure you know when the heat is on.","pros":["The melt setting allows you to melt butter and chocolate without burning it."],"cons":["This device lacks power boost capabilities."]},"strapline":"The GE Cafe PHP9030DJBB induction cooker  includes touch-sensitive controls, a melt setting and a bridge element.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-09-20T00:48:22Z","id":"KudHTY8i36iohm58TcRgaU","meta":{"title":"GE Cafe CHP9530SJSS Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Glide Touch Controls allow you to visually adjust the temperature on the GE Cafe CHP9530SJSS.
