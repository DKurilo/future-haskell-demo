Some people like the bump mechanism over the automatic string advancement because you can more easily monitor how much line you use as you trim. This electric string trimmer uses the standard 0.065-inch diameter line. Additionally, the Craftsman electric trimmer has two feed lines for twice the effectiveness.","Another feature we liked is the telescoping shaft just below the front handle. The handle rotates 180 degrees so you can go directly from trimming to edging. The telescoping shaft also enables you to adjust the shaft length. According to the customer help line, with the shaft fully extended, this electric string trimmer is about 4 feet long. The Craftsman electric trimmer comes with a straight shaft so you can reach under areas with low clearance. The owner&#39;s manual reminds you to unplug it before adjusting the telescoping handle or adjusting any of the parts.","It has two handles, one on the top and another in front, so you can keep better control of where you&#39;re moving the Craftsman electric trimmer. It also makes it easier to hold than an electric string trimmer with only one handle. You can lock the rear handle into two positions.","The head tilts in three different positions, ensuring you&#39;ll be able to get just the right angle for the job. Two of the positions are for trimming and edging. The third is for storing the unit. To adjust the head to the various angles, all you have to do is press the pivot button.","With the edge guard on this electric weed eater, you don&#39;t have to worry about chopping more than you planned. The edge guard keeps you from getting too close to flowerbeds, shrubberies and your prized garden gnome. The edge guard isn&#39;t retractable; it&#39;s a permanent fixture.","The Craftsman electric trimmer also comes with a grass deflector that helps protect you from debris. The deflector goes over the back of the head and the area where the string spins in the back. Even though the grass deflector is in place, you should still always wear protective footwear to lessen the likelihood of injury.","This is a corded electric string trimmer, which means it requires you to plug an extension cord into the trimmer and a power outlet. Be aware that most electric weed trimmers, including this one, don&#39;t include an extension cord. The rear handle has a hook in it to keep the power cord plugged into the trimmer.
