Our reviewers liked the easy setup, the well-organized display and the accuracy of the measurements. Though it is one of the more expensive units we tested, it provides great value because it can measure more than the temperature and is one of the most durable units we tested.","This weather station is more capable than the basic units we reviewed. In addition to measuring temperature and humidity, the AcuRite 5-in-1 also tracks wind speed, wind direction and rainfall. During our tests, we found that the rain gauge was sensitive to small amounts and did not need to be calibrated to make these measurements.","The AcuRite Pro was one of the easiest stations to set up. The outdoor sensor requires no assembly, saving you some work that other complete stations require. It simply needs to be attached to the mounting bracket and either screwed to a wooden post or attached to a pole. We recommend putting it in an open area so it can get accurate wind measurements.","One nice feature of this station is an internal fan that draws internal air into the sensor to reduce overheating due to being exposed to the sun. This ensures more accurate measurements. The fan is powered by a solar cell embedded in the array, but the sensor does need four AA batteries to operate.","We had no problems getting the outdoor sensor to communicate with the indoor console. As with any station, make sure the two components are set to the same channel so the console can receive weather information from outside.","The AcuRite console was one of our favorites. Our reviewers liked how well-lit and organized it is, presenting your weather information in a clear way so you don’t need to hunt for what you want. Another interesting feature of this station is its ability to create localized forecasts based on the data it gathers from your location.","Though it costs much more than the <a href=\"/la-crosse-technology-review\">La Crosse 308-146</a>, the combination of accuracy, quality and design make the AcuRite Pro 5-in-1 one of the best choices for a weather station. If you want up-to-date and complete weather information and forecasts localized to your backyard, this station is one we recommend."]},"id":"3ec4b9a0-ecda-44fe-9d1c-84017e2cb9cd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63335","url":"/acurite-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-09T19:45:06Z","datePublished":"2015-03-09T19:45:06Z","name":"AcuRite Pro 5-in-1","synopsis":"The AcuRite Pro-5-in-1 is one of the best weather stations we tested.
