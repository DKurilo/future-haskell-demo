In our most recent evaluation, we considered 9 products, researching and comparing for over 26 hours. While we didn&#39;t test these objects ourselves, we relied heavily on user experiences to determine which products were the best. As we continued to research, we looked into user reviews to better understand the common experiences users had with each product. We looked to find products that were dependable, safe to use and offered a variety of massaging options. Products with safety concerns were removed from our comparison.<strong><br/></strong>","<strong>How We EvaluatedÂ Â </strong>","We made a list of each massager&#39;s features so we could compare them against each other. Massagers that allow you to change the intensity or speed of a massage were given higher rankings since you are more likely to find the settings you want. We also gave more points to products that offered more preprogrammed massages, including heated massages. Some massagers only work well on one or two areas, while others can be used on most muscle groups. We gave more points to devices that offered more versatility.","We also gave more points to battery operated devices, since they didn&#39;t need to constantly be near an outlet in order to be used. This also meant that they were likely to be better travel companions. The size and weight of each device, was also looked at to see how easy they were to hold for long periods. Typically, massagers that were smaller and weigh less are easier to use. Products were also ranked higher if they were easier to grip by offering rubber handles or ergonomic designs.","With corded massagers, we gave more points when cords were longer. Usually, a nine-foot cord will give you plenty of flexibility to massage your body while being plugged in. Since only some of these massagers come with warranties, we gave more points to the products that were covered. We did not score products based on how much they cost, but we did note whether or not they were on the expensive side.","<strong>Types of Massage</strong>","Shiatsu massage focuses on pressure points and works well on tight muscles. This style of massage is good for most healthy people, though the intensity level can be high. If you have any back injuries you should avoid this type of massager, though it can feel really good on typically strained muscles like the shoulders.","Rolling massage is common among handheld massagers, as it involves applying constant pressure along the part of the body you&#39;re massaging. This is good if you have a hands-on job, like construction work, and is a low-impact way to stimulate the muscles in the lower back. This is a low- to medium-impact style of massage, so it&#39;s suited for most people.","Kneading massage is less common among handheld massagers. This is done with a circular motion, usually on both sides of the spine. This is good for soothing tension and working on particularly strained pressure points. This type of massage also has high-level intensity.","Percussion massage can be done with some handheld massagers depending on the style. It&#39;s done through a series of rapid movements over a spot on the body for a short period of time. While it looks a little violent, this style of massage can relax your muscles and is effective for athletes.","Adding heat to any of the aforementioned styles of massage can take your massage to the next level. Heat relaxes muscles, making them more susceptible to the kind of massage youâre doing. Heat also reduces the possibility of injuring or straining muscles with a handheld massager.","<strong>Things to Consider When Choosing a Handheld Massager</strong>","Versatility &amp; Focus Areas<br/>Some massagers are only good for one or two areas of the body, while others can work just about any muscle group they come across. Additionally, some massagers are very gentle and only work skin deep, while others are more powerful and can work deep tissues. Mechanical devices will often provide various speed and massage settings so you can customize your sessions.","Typically, the more powerful massagers that provide deep tissue massages are filled with more mechanical parts. This often makes them heavier so it might be difficult to hold them for long periods. They also tend to be more expensive. Massagers that are built for simple relaxation will usually just use vibration or non-mechanical means in order to sooth and relax your skin and muscles. These devices are typcially lighter and inexpensive so you wonât strain your hands or arms as quickly.","Heat Settings<br/>Heating abilities provide greater versatility to regular massages. They can help relieve pain in sore muscles to help them heal better as well as improve blood circulation in your body to reduce tension. This is not a necessary feature but it can definitely help you relax more.","Power Sources<br/>Some handheld massagers need to be plugged into an outlet in order to work while others are battery-operated. Corded massagers tend to have more power and often cost less than battery-operated units. Conversly, battery powered massagers are usually less powerful but cost more. They also give you more freedom to move around during a session since you won&#39;t have to be right next to an outlet in order to use them.","Price<br/>We reviewed handheld massagers ranging in price from under $1.99 to over $199. The difference in price is related to each deviceâs design, functionality and quality. Massagers with multiple settings generally cost more, as do massagers that have enough power to provide deep, therapeutic pain relief. Most people can plan to spend $30 to $70."]},"id":"a98726b0-42d4-4ef4-93d9-056d896266ce","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_148","url":"/best-handheld-massagers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-04T22:01:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-04T22:01:00Z","name":"Best Handheld Massagers of 2019","synopsis":"The most effective massagers provide both pain relief and relaxation.
