Epix uses the Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional operating system and has international capabilities.","Standout Features<br/>•\t2.5-inch touchscreen<br/>•\tQWERTY keyboard with stylus<br/>•\t2 MP camera<br/>•\t3G speed","Features","The Epix features a 2.5-inch touch screen with a 320x320 pixel resolution. The interface has a vibrating feedback to let you know the phone recognized a touch. Text entry is accomplished using the physical QWERTY keyboard with or without the included stylus. The keyboard features an optical mouse button to assist in navigating within the interface. The keyboard’s keys create problems due to their unresponsiveness. They require an unusual amount of force to press which will slow down text input.","In general, using a touch screen takes some practice in order to be comfortable with it and the Epix is no exception. Actually, considering the size of the display, it requires careful attention to be sure that your taps are accurate. You may find it easier to use the stylus to cut down on mistakes although that is a cumbersome solution.","The Epix has a standard 2 MP camera with 2x zoom,  flash and video capture. The picture quality is average but the video quality is quite good. The phone also includes the Windows Media Player Mobile for music and you can stream music and video with AT&amp;T Music and AT&amp;T Video.","Other features include 3G speed, stereo Bluetooth capability, battery talk time of up to 7 hours and 105 MB of built-in memory with a MicroSD slot that takes up to a 32GB card. The Epix also has WiFi, assisted GPS and is compatible with AT&amp;T Navigator as well as AT&amp;T Navigator Global Edition for travel overseas. It supports Word and Excel document creation and you can also view PowerPoint and pdf documents. The Epix includes a host of organizational tools such as an extensive address book, a notepad, alarm clock, stopwatch, calculator, conversion calculator, voice recorder and a task list. The Epix supports email from multiple providers including POP3 and IMAP accounts.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"a261d7e4-c15d-4cfe-bc8b-7881ff1ba96c","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Epix uses a proprietary 2.5mm headphone jack so you’ll need to use the included adapter for a standard size headphone jack.
