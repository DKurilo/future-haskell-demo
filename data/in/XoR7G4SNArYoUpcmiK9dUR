Some are successful enough to work out of studios, while others are based at home, but all of them need to collect payments for their services. Merchant accounts can quickly become expensive, and they are not always convenient for travel or event photographers who visit multiple locations. This is where Square comes in.","Square was founded by Jack Dorsey, the inventor of Twitter, and has been around for a couple of years now. When you sign up for an account, you will receive a free card reader that plugs into your smartphone or tablet. This card reader allows photographers to manage their own <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a> Â  even if they don&#39;t have a retail location they use to meet clients.","Square supports Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discovery cards and will automatically process payments to your bank account the very next day. It is not meant specifically for photographers, but for all small businesses and self-employed individuals. It is a highly flexible, low-cost solution for processing credit cards.","The Square app that runs on your Android or iOS device is effectively a point-of-sale (POS) unit. You customize it with your prices, products, photos and service fees and use this to facilitate payments with clients. Simply swipe the card and let the customer sign for the payment with their fingers. Receipts can be emailed or sent as a text message to your clients as soon as the payment is received. The app will also keep a record of your sales patterns so that wedding photographers can track the most popular wedding package they sell while studio photographers can monitor their popular portrait offerings.","Square operates on a flat rate of 2.75 percent per transaction. There are no monthly fees or contracts to sign, so you always know how much you are being charged for credit card processing. This in itself can be a great draw for some people who are tired of the payment plans associated with a traditional merchant account.","Your clients may be worried about security, but Square works hard to ensure that sensitive data is encrypted to industry standards. It is VeriSign trusted and PCI Compliant, so using this service really comes with no more risk than using your credit card at a standard point-of-sale location.","Another possible boon for photographers is the ability to accept credit card payments over the phone. Simply tap in the card number, expiration date and security code, and you can take payment without the client ever being present, just like you would if you bought something over the internet or at a call center. These transactions, however, are priced higher at 3.5 percent plus 15 cents per transaction.","So, if you&#39;re a photographer who is looking to cut costs or open up new payment options for clients, Square is a great option that is worthy of your consideration. It&#39;s flexible, convenient and is one of the best credit card processing services for small businesses like yours."]},"id":"91ac81ae-3494-479d-841a-2230de2edbf7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6466","url":"/credit-card-processing-for-photographers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jonathan-wylie","url":"/author/jonathan-wylie","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jonathan Wylie","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dmpAeXU5XQymRmsWKwDrd8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-18T16:07:23Z","datePublished":"2011-08-18T16:07:23Z","name":"Credit Card Processing for Photographers","synopsis":"The majority of photographers today are self-employed.
