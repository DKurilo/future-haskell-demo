We know that savvy consumers like to shop around to find the best of the best, so we aim to create a one-stop shop so you can compare the best products and be on your way.","Shopping for a pool heater can be a particularly difficult process, since there are so many options that sound identical and a lot of elements that factor into finding the perfect one for your pool. We dived deep into the world of pool heating to find the pros and cons of different types of heaters, the best products for different circumstances, sizing and installation advice, and in-depth information about each of the best pool heaters on the market, all to recommend the best pool heaters to keep you swimming in warm waters.","<strong>How Much Does a Pool Heater Cost?</strong>","Depending on the size of your pool, a pool heater can cost anywhere from $750 up to several thousand dollars. Costlier heaters offer more power, higher-quality construction and better performance.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong>","We spent over 50 hours researching the best pool heating products. We started this process by shopping around, looking for the highest rated and most popular products out there. We created a list of about 15 heaters, heat pumps, solar products and other options for consideration and did further research into the specifications of each of these.","Since pool size and climate are hugely important factors when choosing a pool heater, we created our recommendations based on two scenarios: a round, above-ground pool (24 feet in diameter and 52 inches deep) in the Southwestern U.S (Arizona), and the same pool in the Midwestern U.S. (Ohio). We considered the theoretical performance of each product for our imaginary pool in both climates. We gathered a lot of info from installation instructions, user manuals, specs sheets, online reviews, expert opinions, videos and any other useful thing we could find, and we did quite a few calculations as well. Once gathered, we compiled all that data into a massive spreadsheet so we could better weigh and compare the information and products against one another to find the very best pool heaters.","<strong>How to Choose a Pool Heater</strong>","There are several ways to heat a pool, from gas pool heaters to electric heat pumps to solar options. Determining the best one for your circumstances depends on a number of factors, such as your location, climate, temperature preferences and how and when you plan to use your heater. All products we reviewed are low NOx (nitrogen oxide) emitting and can be used in areas with air quality regulations. A good tip, regardless of which type of heater you choose, is to invest in a solar pool cover. This helps insulate your pool to keep warmth in your water, and it also slows evaporation.","Gas Heaters<br/>Gas pool heaters use natural gas or propane. Most products of this type are available for either power source, and some are convertible. Propane tends to cost more, though you get more heating power from it. Natural gas can be much cheaper than propane, so it’s best to figure out which fuel type is more cost effective in your area. These heaters run similarly to your home’s hot water heater. They burn gas in a combustion chamber and transfer that heat into the pool’s water as it circulates through the heater.","Gas pool heaters are best for pools that are not used every day. They heat quickly and work regardless of ambient temperature. Money-wise, they cost less upfront than heat pumps but have higher operating costs. You also may need to hire a professional for installation.","When considering a gas pool heater, you need to calculate the size and surface area of your pool, as well as your desired swimming temperature, to determine which model and size would work best.<br/><br/>Heat Pumps<br/>Pool heat pumps run on electricity and transfer the warmth of the surrounding air to heat a pool. This means that they are efficient for keeping your pool warm as long as the average ambient temperature remains above 45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Electric heat pumps are a great option if you live in a climate that rarely dips below that range or if you simply want to extend your swimming season a bit into late spring and early autumn.","Electric heat pumps raise your pool’s temperature less quickly than gas heaters, but they can be kept running longer for less money, which makes them a more cost-effective option if you want to use your pool every day. The units cost more upfront but can have much lower operational costs, factoring in both fuel and repairs.","When looking for a heat pump, you need to consider your swimming habits, the size and surface area of your pool, and your area’s climate. You may also need to run a proper 220-volt electrical line and get professional installation.","Solar Heaters<br/>Solar pool heaters harness the power of the sun to heat your pool and can be the most cost-effective option in places with a lot of sun. Most of these work by pumping your pool water through a solar collector, which absorbs the sun’s rays and transfers heat into the water before circulating it back into your pool. These can use your existing pool pump, so they don’t require much more electricity than you already use, making them a great, cheap way to raise your pool temps a few degrees.","More so than heat pumps, solar arrays rely upon warm ambient temperatures and, of course, sun exposure to heat your pool. Prices for solar arrays can vary widely, with several products available for a few hundred dollars or less and other, more expensive options that can also heat your water for domestic use.","If you want to go solar, consider your solar resources. If you have a largely unshaded, south-facing area, that should do the trick. You should also grab a diverter so that you can run your pump without running the water through the panels, which can actually cool your pool when the panels are not collecting sunlight.","Sizing a Pool Heater<br/>Whether you want a gas, electric or solar pool heater, finding the correct sized product for your pool is important. Gas and electric heaters are measured in Btu, or British thermal units. This is the amount of energy it takes to raise one pound of water by one degree.","Before we get to the math, you should know that there are plenty of helpful calculators online that can help you figure out your heating needs. You can also consult a pool pro for some more specific guidance.","To figure the size yourself, you first need to know your pool’s surface area. For quadrilateral pools, this is the length times the width. For circular pools, this is half the width multiplied by 3.14. Kidney-shaped pools should be treated like rectangles for simplicity’s sake. Make note of the surface area. Then take that and multiply it times the average depth of your pool. This is the volume of your pool in cubic feet. There are about 7.5 gallons of water in a cubic foot, so multiply your volume by 7.5, and you have approximately how many gallons are in your pool. Many pool heater manufacturers have charts available to help you figure out what size heater you need based upon these measurements. Know also that things like your climate, ideal swimming temperature and how quickly you want your pool to heat will also factor in.","Solar pool heaters should be roughly equivalent to half the surface area of your pool. This can take up a lot of room, so make sure you have enough space without shade. Many people opt to place their solar collectors on a roof, though this requires a little more exertion from your pump.","Installation<br/>We generally advise that you consult a professional about the installation of gas heaters, electric heat pumps and more complicated solar arrays.
