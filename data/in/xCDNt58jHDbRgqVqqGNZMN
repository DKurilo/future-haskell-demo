Until recently, however, those plans always gave you a little less for your money. With changes that have brought the company in line with the competition – and made it even cheaper, in some cases – Kajeet has rocketed its way into position as a premium competitor with some of the best prepaid plans on the market.","If you&#39;re a parent who wants to buy your child a new phone, going through Kajeet will let you manage when that phone can make calls, send texts and browse the web. You can set up a separate set of minutes that only work within the family, so you can stay in touch with your children regardless of other limitations you&#39;ve set. You can also whitelist or blacklist different websites or limit your kid&#39;s web browser to Kajeet&#39;s pre-screened list of safe addresses.","The company has six different prepaid phone plans, all of which are geared towards children and teens. The cheapest is a $4.99 pay-as-you-go plan for feature phones. You only get 10 minutes of base talk time with it, but you can pay for additional minutes, texts and data on a per-use basis. If your teen wants a new smartphone, you can pay between $25 and $50 every month for a plan with unlimited text and picture messaging, at least 500 talk minutes, and at least half a gigabyte of data. The top-tier, $49.99 plan offers unlimited voice and text, along with 2GB of data, which is on par with what you can get from other providers for the same price. You also get free geo-location with all three smartphone plans, so you can easily track where the phone is – and, by extension, your child – from any computer.","Kajeet doesn&#39;t offer flagship phones from its online store, but you can sometimes bring Sprint-capable devices to the company and take advantage of its plans and parental controls. Should you be in the market for a new device, you have a small selection of decent prepaid smartphones and feature phones to choose from, including mid-tier favorites like the HTC Desire 510, the LG G3 Vigor and Apple&#39;s iPhone 5. They&#39;re all rather pricey, though, so we&#39;d recommend buying off eBay or from Sprint directly. Whichever way you go, be sure to check with Kajeet that the device&#39;s IMEI number is compatible with Kajeet service, before you buy the phone outright."]},"id":"0da50a6b-7d36-4fc3-aaba-30d7b6b4020d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"18be4c08-2c70-4e80-ae7b-ead989cf1650","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you&#39;re a parent who wants to give your child a cell phone while making sure they don&#39;t abuse the privilege, Kajeet is a superb solution.
