It has an enormous oven, measuring 6.3 cubic feet, to accommodate enough food for a feast.","LG designed this model to rival a professional baking oven. Its trademarked ProBake Convection construction locates the heating elements on the back wall rather than the floor of the oven. Hot air is distributed evenly throughout the oven cavity, which is great for baking cakes, cookies, hams, side dishes and even those finicky soufflés and meringues. The oven’s cooking modes include bake, broil, convection bake, convection roast, favorites, multirack convection bake, delayed bake, warm, pizza and speed roast.","Seven rack-positioning options let you adjust the two oven racks to accommodate the height of whatever you are cooking. This slide-in range comes with LG’s trademarked EasyClean function, which lets you use water and the oven’s special heat to steam clean the its special enamel finish in 10 minutes. This offers relatively light cleaning and does not tough grime, so the manufacturer recommends you run the EasyClean function often to prevent burned or built-up debris.","The range has a storage drawer, but you do not get a warming drawer, which would be a great addition to this otherwise versatile slide-in range. The oven itself, however, provides a warming function, which keeps food warm for 3 hours without overcooking it. If you know you’d use a warming drawer often, take a look at the <a href=\"/samsung-nx58k9500wg-review\">Samsung NX58K9500WG/AA</a>.","This electric slide-in range is equipped with a clock, a timer, an automatic lockout function for safety and delayed-start cooking. With this last setting, you can put food in and set the delayed-timer function so the food will start cooking when you want it to.","The stainless steel LG has a smooth black ceramic glass cooktop with four burners and a central cooktop warming zone. The glossy cooktop features two 6-inch-diameter burners, a 9-inch burner and another 6-inch burner that can expand to 9 inches, as well as a handy warming area that measures 7 inches."]},"id":"43f0cfe3-8226-41b6-bd55-e1f996f37a60","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63915","url":"/lg-electronics-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-02T19:59:34Z","datePublished":"2015-04-02T19:59:34Z","name":"LG LSE4611ST","synopsis":"The LG LSE4611ST gives you some of the most cutting-edge baking capabilities available on  electric slide-in ranges for the consumer market.","review":{"rating":82,"verdict":"The LG LSE4611ST offers plenty of oven space and a well-equipped, four-burner electric cooktop.","pros":["You get a huge oven with an oven safety lock."],"cons":["There is no warming drawer."]},"strapline":"The LG LSE4611ST gives you some of the most cutting-edge baking capabilities available on  electric slide-in ranges for the consumer market.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-07-19T00:00:00Z","id":"AdwCtnv2HzxMSn2CZpoCn8","meta":{"title":"LG LSE4611ST Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The LG LSE4611ST offers plenty of oven space and a well-equipped, four-burner electric cooktop."},"products":[{"slug":"lg-lse4611st","url":"/product/lg-lse4611st","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:58Z","name":"LG LSE4611ST","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:58Z","id":"GbUPVrL6VBjMpJcKpLFjMB","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:16:58Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/8XGCddCGUX3jfYsZ5Bn4LA.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:58Z","mimeType":"","name":"90a4a8e8064976ed1e7e6c9798a0587d.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/90a4a8e8064976ed1e7e6c9798a0587d.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:58Z","id":"8XGCddCGUX3jfYsZ5Bn4LA","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8XGCddCGUX3jfYsZ5Bn4LA.jpg","alt":""},"title":"LG LSE4611ST Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The LG LSE4611ST offers plenty of oven space and a well-equipped, four-burner electric cooktop."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/8XGCddCGUX3jfYsZ5Bn4LA.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:58Z","mimeType":"","name":"90a4a8e8064976ed1e7e6c9798a0587d.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/90a4a8e8064976ed1e7e6c9798a0587d.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:58Z","id":"8XGCddCGUX3jfYsZ5Bn4LA","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8XGCddCGUX3jfYsZ5Bn4LA.jpg","alt":""},"title":"LG LSE4611ST Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The LG LSE4611ST offers plenty of oven space and a well-equipped, four-burner electric cooktop."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/kitchen/best-slide-in-ranges/lg-electronics-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:58Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:58Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"ranges","url":"/kitchen/ranges","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:58Z","name":"Ranges","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:58Z","id":"qFBeHJ8yhjqgKDeYRmaFwK","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
