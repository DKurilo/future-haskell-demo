You can still read our original review below, but TopTenREVIEWS is no longer updating this product’s information.</em><br/>","The last on our lineup of the best <a href=\"/best-standard-dvd-players\">flip down DVD players</a> is the Tview model. This slightly larger flip down monitor and DVD player combo remains at the bottom of the heap due largely to its lack of usability and its poor customer support. It does have a large screen with decent resolution, but it is very difficult to install and use. The options to contact their customer support are limited and no warranty is offered. Overall, the basic screen specifications of this model are impressive and it includes every feature we looked for, but the almost total lack of usability and customer support hurt it in the rankings.","The screen on the Tview model is 14” wide, placing it just above average on our lineup. The screen resolution is a respectable 1440 x 234, delivering a picture that is not quite as crisp as the models by Zycom or Pyle Audio, but is still easily visible and clear. The contrast ratio, like all portable, ceiling mounted screens, is 500:1. The TFT-LCD technology is utilized in this model, like the other flip down DVD players on our matrix.","The high point of the Tview flip down DVD player is its extraordinary feature set. The crucial and convenient combination of an IR headset transmitter and an FM module is present in this model, making simultaneous broadcasting a possibility. With the two of these features working in tandem, you can choose to listen simultaneously to the movie or to divide the car by streaming the movie through the headsets and using the vehicle’s stereo for the radio.","USB and audio/video inputs are present on this flip down DVD player, as well as an SD card slot and a compatible remote control. The DVD player can also read CDs and MP3 discs, granting you more flexibility in your media selection. The feature set of this device impressed us, but it was not enough to overshadow its shortcomings in other areas.","The Tview flip down monitor is one of the most difficult-to-use electronics that we have come in contact with. Due to its larger size, it weighs more than a normal player, putting more strain on the ceiling of your vehicle. Once you have the device installed, the difficulty of learning to use the device presents itself. An exceedingly brief user manual accompanies the player, providing accurate, if insufficient, instruction on the product’s usage. The buttons on the front of the player are difficult to press, the configuration menu is near inaccessible and the screen obscures all hope of using the rearview mirror. The usability of this device is abysmal.","No warranty is included with the purchase of this device, meaning that you will more than likely be responsible for damages incurred after a brief period of time. It’s possible that Tview will be able to exchange or return the product if it is defective, but not for the full year allotted by some other plans. If you need to contact customer support, you may do so via an email address or a telephone number."]},"id":"b90a370f-58fd-4f00-a6ba-09b3467cba4a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"54f476a5-c2f2-4586-a97c-28bf3423634a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are willing to put up with significant difficulties in installing and operating a flip down DVD player but want to maintain a large screen size, the Tview model may be the choice for you.
