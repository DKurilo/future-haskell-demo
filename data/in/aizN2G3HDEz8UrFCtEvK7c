The Echo Spot has a camera that lets you make free video calls to other Amazon smart speaker users, and if you add a smart doorbell to your home network, you can see who is knocking on your door and talk to them without leaving the comfort of your bed.","<br/><strong><br/>More Guides to Help You Sleep Better: </strong>"]},"id":"df4abb32-1349-4fda-9b01-77a66e0f0e56","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/best-mattress\">The Best Mattresses</a>","<a href=\"/best-humidifiers\">The Best Humidifiers</a>","<a href=\"/best-sound-machines\">The Best Sound Machines</a>","<a href=\"/best-smoke-detectors\">The Best Smoke Detectors</a>","<a href=\"/best-programmable-thermostats\">The Best Smart Thermostats</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"fea95c54-4065-4bd7-8eac-63ddea25519e","type":"list"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"fe4ccfd6-8f0b-49a5-a73e-2eeb06e5565f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/electrohome-projection-review\">Electrohome Projection EAAC601</a>","<a href=\"/philips-review\">Philips AJT4400B/37</a>","<a href=\"/homelabs-sunrise-review\">Homelabs Sunrise Alarm Clock</a>","<a href=\"/mpow-review\">Mpow Projection Clock</a>","<a href=\"/oregon-scientific-projection-alarm-clock-review\">Oregon Scientific RM313PNFA</a>","<a href=\"/sony-review\">Sony ICFC1T</a>","<a href=\"/timex-xbbu-dual-alarm-clock-review\">Timex XBBU Dual Alarm T128</a>","<a href=\"/travelwey-review\">Travelwey Home LED Clock</a>","<a href=\"/la-crosse-technology-projection-alarm-clock-review\">La Crosse Technology 616-143</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"eada7a43-1409-4f8a-873a-db85666cea2e","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_15","url":"/best-alarm-clocks","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-28T14:33:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-28T14:33:00Z","name":"Best Alarm Clocks of 2019","synopsis":"We tested 10 alarm clocks that cost less than $60 to help you find the best one to replace the alarm app on your phone.
