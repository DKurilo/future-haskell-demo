Whether it’s basic maintenance or tree cleanup, this device is well-equipped to slice through with logs and branches quickly.","Whereas most chainsaws use round chisel chains, this Remington comes equipped with steel bucking teeth to give operators increased leverage and control while cutting. Due to the edges of these chains, they more easily grip wood and maintain cutting speeds with fewer jams."]},"id":"89376c78-6e76-4b43-839d-adbcdf736ef4","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/EVrdGUyzg9Qg49vgL4S3PL.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56689-remington-rm1635w2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EVrdGUyzg9Qg49vgL4S3PL.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"EVrdGUyzg9Qg49vgL4S3PL","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EVrdGUyzg9Qg49vgL4S3PL.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e0452011-df38-4973-8126-07d49b59aa15","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Remington RM1635W is known for its emphasis on operator safety as well as cutting performance. While advertised to handle only trees of up to three or four inches in diameter, this tool can handle larger trees of up to a full foot. Such tasks may take longer as it will require meticulous and gradual cutting angles.","Remington offers a two-year limited warranty on this chainsaw, ensuring any flaws will show themselves before the warranty runs out. Many chainsaw owners find few flaws in their tool over the course of the first year, but after a season of storage some manufacturer defects may crop up. However, electric chainsaws like this Remington model encounter fewer issues from being in storage for prolonged periods. Gas engines tend to leave residual fuel throughout the various parts of the engine, which can then harden and block fuel flow when used again. Not so with electric chainsaws.","One of the issues found in this device is the tension adjuster. The tensioner runs along a plastic track, which when screwed too much can cause the mechanism to bend. It will require some practice to utilize effectively and ensure a proper level of tension without damaging an interior piece of the chainsaw.","The Remington RM1635W, like any other electric-powered chainsaw, doesn’t contribute to air pollution. Because it&#39;s not gasoline powered, the tool is quiet. Without the added weight of a gas tank and two-stroke engine – reducing its weight to just over nine pounds – this device is lightweight and offers a reduced amount of vibration in use. Overall, this device is an excellent value for its price, offering enough power to match its low price."]},"id":"b93ffb46-96d3-47a7-875d-f1d2cd69c9d2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56717","url":"/remington-chain-saw-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-10T19:02:48Z","datePublished":"2013-06-10T19:02:48Z","name":"Remington RM1635W","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
