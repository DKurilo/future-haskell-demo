The company doesn&#39;t offer a large variety of DVD/VCR combos, but the products available from this company have many benefits. Most of the models are compatible with DVD video, DVD+R/RW, CD-R/RW, DVD-R/RW and audio CDs. The VCR players on these products boast still frame and slow motion features as well as time search capabilities.Â ","You may also find many convenience features included on these models, such as parental controls to ensure you know exactly the type of material your kids are allowed to view. Most of these products come with a remote control, and you can choose from three different languages for the display screen: English, Spanish or French.","The Magnavox DVD/VCR players excel in the sound department. The inclusion of a virtual surround system means that some DVD/VCR combo players are compatible with complex home-theater systems. Most of these units also feature Dolby Digital sound. These two features ensure that you get the full, rich audio experience contained on a VHS tape or DVD.","Because Blu-ray players are compatible with almost all DVDs, the main selling point for DVD/VCR combo units is the VCR portion. VCRs are becoming harder and harder to come by, and only a few manufacturers still maintain a line of VCR players. The VCR portion of the Magnavox DVD/VCR players contain a four-head hi-fi unit capable of playing all your old VHS tapes that are still in good condition.","Another feature on many of these units that is quite useful is satellite-link recording. This technology allows you to record incoming signals onto a VHS or a rewriteable DVD. It works the same way that old VCRs did when they were the only option for recording shows on television. Furthermore, you will benefit from many component options on these machines. S-Video, component and coaxial connections are all included.","If you have any issues using these machines, you can contact company representatives via email or telephone. You can also access the owner&#39;s manuals directly on the company website. The feature set and customer support options on these products allow you to take a trip to yesteryear and enjoy all of your favorite DVDs and video tapes with ease."]},"id":"3c5f2299-229b-4b25-9936-ed65a360d82d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53232","url":"/magnavox-dvd-vcr-player-dv225mg9-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-07-05T17:32:21Z","datePublished":"2011-07-05T17:32:21Z","name":"Magnavox DVD VCR Player DV225MG9","synopsis":"Magnavox provides DVD/VCR players with multiple input and output options, excellent sound quality and trilingual on-screen displays.
