We awarded the Frigidaire GLFH21F8H upright freezer the Top Ten Reviews Gold Award to showcase the professional balance between functionality, technology and usability. Frigidaire has created an upright freezer that excels in all of our review criteria and is affordable as well. Ultimately, the Frigidaire’s additional shelves and extra features wooed itself into the top spot. The Frigidaire GLFH21F8H was also ranked number one over every other upright freezer because of its large, 20.5 cubic feet capacity and long list of features, like a Soft Freeze Zone and Frost Free."]},"id":"39b8162a-f93f-41bc-a73f-e877297f3edc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Energy Cost &amp; Efficiency"},"id":"5bdd7604-42cf-4f84-be1a-516694d442ad","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Have you ever run across a sale on frozen vegetables, pizza or ice cream that you just couldn’t pass up? Does all of that extra food lead to cramming and jamming boxes and bags into the freezer area of your side-by-side refrigerator and freezer? What you need is an upright freezer that resides in your garage, basement or other storage area. That way, you’ll have the extra freezer space for when frozen peas go on sale for 50 cents a bag or Breyers ice cream offers coupons at $2 a carton. The Frigidaire GLFH21F8H would be a perfect solution to your problem as it is equipped with seven door bins and shelves, four inside shelves, two baskets and a bright light to help your search. One shelf is even specifically called a pizza shelf because it is a thin area where frozen, boxed items can be stacked. Another convenient storage solution is the wire door bins that tilt out for easy access – a perfect area for all of those frozen peas. Additional door bins – plastic, not wired – are adjustable to fit your storage needs. Once the freezer is stocked with delicious frozen foods, protect your investment from unintentional entry via the built-in lock with a pop out key.","The Frigidaire GLFH21F8H upright freezer has a 20.5-cubic-feet capacity, approximately equivalent to 711 pounds of food. You would think with this much storage space it would cost an arm and a leg to pay this appliance’s electric bill, but that is false thinking. Because the Frigidaire GLFH21F8H is Energy Star compliant, the estimated yearly operating cost is only $74. When compared to non-compliant upright freezers, you are looking at a $30+ savings every year. This may not sound like a lot, but as we all know, costs add up, and saving a couple of bucks here and there is a huge help. A convenient temperature monitor is the money-saving, energy-conserving super hero. It is located on the outside of the freezer and makes sure the temperature stays consistent. If the temperature rises above a certain level or the door is left ajar, an audible alarm will alert you to the problem."]},"id":"42e2ecfc-7621-4dee-a4f2-cf4d83da3ee4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Dimensions &amp; Warranty"},"id":"1614d999-be36-49a2-ae5a-dc2325a4c53c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Just like you wouldn’t spend money on a cake that wasn’t beautifully decorated, you shouldn’t spend money on an upright freezer that doesn’t have a plethora of features.

This simple light could be the means to saving an entire freezer full of food due to an unexpected power outage.","Soft Freeze Zone – A special feature for all of you ice cream connoisseurs out there. The soft freeze zone is a specific area in the freezer that is purposely kept at a warmer temperature than the rest of the freezer to guarantee appropriately frozen, but still scoopable, ice cream.

The height is adjustable with leveling legs included with purchase, making the freezer’s shelves easily accessible for a person of any stature. The standard Frigidaire GLFH21F8H comes in white, but you can also request black. The only drawback to this upright freezer’s physical appearance is that you can’t reverse the way the door swings.
