You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Axxera AVN6446BT is an aftermarket <a href=\"/best-in-dash-navigation-systems\">in-dash navigation system</a> with excellent Apple smartphone integration. It comes preloaded with a variety of maps and points of interest, all of which you can view on its 6.2-inch screen. You can customize the interface and connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth to play music or videos, keeping everyone in your car entertained.","The double-din GPS navigation system comes preloaded with maps of the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as about 10 million points of interest. Only the <a href=\"/soundstream-review\">Soundstream</a> and <a href=\"/clarion-review\">Clarion</a> systems have more POIs, which means you can start driving and exploring as soon as you install the device. The navigation system is well-armed with an arsenal of navigation assistance features, such as route avoidance and lane assistance, which guide you around traffic and ensure you’re always in the correct lane. Additionally, it provides turn-by-turn navigation and keeps the current speed limit on-screen for whatever road you’re driving on.","The Axxera’s interface lets you view the navigation map, entertainment options and various audio settings while you drive. The touchscreen navigation device has a 6.2-inch display with an 800 x 480-pixel resolution, which is on par with most other models we reviewed. From the interface, you can adjust the brightness of the screen or change the display’s background. Passengers in the rear seat of your vehicle can use the remote control to play a song or video and adjust other settings. With its steering wheel integration function, you can continue to use volume controls on your steering wheel.","You can play CDs and DVDs with the system, as well as stored media from a USB device or SD card, or directly from your phone using the built-in Bluetooth compatibility. The AVN6446BT also allows you to play satellite radio as well as streaming content from the internet.","Axxera’s customer service representatives are available via email, and their social media presence provides you with another way to contact the company. The in-dash navigation unit ships with a two-year manufacturer warranty.","The Axxera AVN6446BT is powerful and feature-rich. Though there are other devices that have more maps preloaded, and one or two million more points of interest, the AVN6446BT checks nearly all of the boxes otherwise. Its impressive media playback capacities and external device compatibility make it easy to interact with your smartphone apps or watch a movie right on the device’s touchscreen. Backed by a two-year warranty, the device is a good in-dash navigation system that won’t break the bank."]},"id":"c99770e3-3d65-43a0-9170-b3ac2c8bd9d4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69227","url":"/axxera-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-04-17T13:47:11Z","datePublished":"2017-04-17T13:47:11Z","name":"Axxera AVN6446BT","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":24,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2017-04-17T13:47:11Z","id":"PNoFuqTHSFjxzMMe7JN2LV","meta":{"title":"Axxera AVN6446BT Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Axxera AVN6446BT is an excellent value for an in-dash navigation system, and has impressive features and compatibility.
