There are four main methods you should be aware of: online <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a>, POS terminals, mobile terminals and manual transactions. Choosing the right processes can help you run your business more efficiently. Here is an explanation of each process type to help you figure out which ones are the best fit for your business.","<strong>Online</strong>","Online credit card processing involves using a website to sell products or services. The merchant service will often provide you with a shopping cart feature that you can add to your site so that customers can purchase your goods quickly and easily. This type of processing is obviously the best choice for online merchants.","<strong>Terminals</strong>","Terminals are card readers that customers can slide their credit card&#39;s magnetic strip through when paying for an item. There are also terminals that customers can tap with their card to make a transaction. These types of terminals are called &#34;tap and pay&#34; terminals and they read cards that have RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) chips inside of them. Some terminals can process both types of cards.","No matter which type of terminal you choose, these machines attach to the cash register and process transactions using a phone or internet connection. Terminals make sense for retailers who sell their goods in brick-and-mortar stores","<strong>Mobile </strong>","Mobile terminals are a lot like the terminals you use in a brick-and-mortar business, except that they are portable. Mobile terminals plug into a mobile phone. The credit card can be swiped through the terminal, and the credit card transaction is processed using the phone&#39;s internet connection. Some merchant services can do mobile phone transactions without a terminal. The merchant uses a special app to type in the credit card&#39;s information and the app sends the information to the merchant service to be processed. This type of process is best for merchants who are constantly traveling or who sell items door-to-door.","<strong>Manual</strong>","Manual credit card transactions are processed without using any fancy electronics. The merchant uses a manual credit card imprinter to create a copy of the customer&#39;s credit card. A manual credit card imprinter is a machine that you place a credit card on and cover the credit card with a piece of special paper. Then, you pull the lever of the machine and it rubs the raised numbers and letters of the credit card against the paper. When the process is done correctly, an imprint of the card&#39;s numbers and letters are left on the paper.","The credit card information is then manually typed in and sent to the merchant service. This is a good option for businesses that don&#39;t make a lot of credit card transactions since it can be a tedious process.","These four types of processing are very different, but they are intended for certain types of businesses. Once you choose the right one for your business you will find that your business will run much more efficiently."]},"id":"820788e6-852d-4a41-b256-41c6fa636ba7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_7325","url":"/the-different-types-of-credit-card-processing-merchant-services","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"alina-bradford","url":"/author/alina-bradford","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Alina Bradford","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"B3tPrF8sxRUy8i2s9RVdDe","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-05-24T13:49:28Z","datePublished":"2012-05-24T13:49:28Z","name":"The Different Types of Credit Card Processing Merchant Services","synopsis":"Merchant services offer several ways to process credit card transactions.","review":{},"strapline":"Merchant services offer several ways to process credit card transactions.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-05-31T21:48:40Z","id":"ucXj6DgywpSGWSz5p49xba","meta":{"title":"The Different Types of Credit Card Processing Merchant Services","description":"There are several different ways that you can take credit card transactions using a merchant service.
