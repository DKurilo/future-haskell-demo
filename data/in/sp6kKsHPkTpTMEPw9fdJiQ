It features the classic Disney characters Mickey and Donald Duck on a red and green Christmas train filled to the brim with gifts. As one of our reviewers put it, this is “Christmas morning gold!”","This set comes with an engine and three train cars. The couplings between cars are easy to work with, the engine has a functioning headlamp and the boxcar even has a moving door on the side. The 32 pieces of track can be built into an oval as large as 73.2 x 50 inches, but you can create other shapes if you use fewer pieces. We recommend reading the instructions because we realized building the track at random doesn’t always result in a closed circuit for the train to go around. The plastic pieces of track have to be pushed together, and we’ll admit our hands were pretty raw after a while. The track itself also wouldn’t lay flat on the floor for a full business day, but the problem was corrected overnight with a little help from gravity.","The train itself needs six C batteries in the engine and the remote requires three AAA. You’ll need a screw driver to install them all, but once you’ve done so you can turn the train on and start playing right away. The wireless remote has a speed dial for forward and backward movement along with buttons for bells, whistles and audio callouts, though the train itself makes chuffing sounds continually when it’s on. One of our testers pointed out that audio callouts of “all aboard!” and other train-themed phrases aren’t in the voices of Mickey or Donald Duck, but we doubt that will be an issue for young children. And speaking of kids, this train is recommended for children age 4 or older.","This train is a far cry from the realistic and highly detailed <a href=\"/bachmann-freightmaster-review\">Bachmann Freightmaster</a> or <a href=\"/santa-fe-blue-lightning-review\">Santa Fe Blue Lightning</a>, and it’s remote reflects that. The train moves faster or slower depending on how far you turn the dial, but generally it’s not very responsive. It takes a long time for the train to slow to a stop, which might be dangerous for little ones and their little fingers. It’s also the second-fastest train we tested, maxing out at 1.75 feet per second while still staying on the track. The engine&#39;s driving wheels have free-moving rods, and while they&#39;re plastic, they&#39;re easy to get your fingers stuck in. We recommend adult supervision with this toy.","Not only is this train fun, it’s durable. As one tester put it, “I feel like I could leave this one with my kids and they wouldn’t break it!” Just to be sure, we dropped it four times from a height of 3 feet and noticed it started running at a higher pitch after the second drop. Nothing changed after the third, but the train’s responsiveness had somewhat decreased after the fourth drop. In short, this train can’t handle much abuse, so it earned a D in durability. Our testers really loved its horsepower, fun sounds and overall cheery feel, though it’s not realistic like some of the other models we tested, nor is it for all year round. It’s also quite loud, which can be annoying for long periods of time, so it earned a B+ in design and detail.","Almost any train is going to be more expensive if you buy it from the manufacturer. We were able to find substantially less expensive models on secondary market websites like Amazon, but even from the manufacturer the Mickey Mouse Train was reasonably priced. You don’t get any extras like figurines or scenery pieces, but this train’s speed, durability and easy setup make it a great pick for young children."]},"id":"62408996-c135-4591-8ff0-4baf9ab3d42f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70289","url":"/mickey-mouse-train-set-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-10-16T20:55:02Z","datePublished":"2018-10-16T20:55:02Z","name":"Mickey Mouse Train Set","synopsis":"This Lionel train can be fun for young and old train lovers alike.
