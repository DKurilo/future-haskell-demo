Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","With a great set of features, solid warranty and a moderate price point, the Samsung DV410AEW/XAA is the definition of a well-rounded <a href=\"/best-dryers\">clothes dryer</a>. Even though we were looking at the lower end of the clothes dryers price range, we had great expectations for the dryers we reviewed. This one did not disappoint. This Samsung dryer had everything we expected and quite a few features beyond that, all in one well-designed package. Though we liked the Whirlpool WED7400XW dryers and the Frigidaire FAQE7073KN dryers, neither boast the combination of sanitize and steam features, coupled with an excellent warranty and price, like the Samsung dryers."]},"id":"403d4f0e-407b-4525-8bbd-679b0707f6d6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Functionality"},"id":"df4855d4-d55c-4bbc-a12c-d67c1c8b18bf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This machine is packed with features when compared to other dryers in its class, but it still has plenty of room for 7.4 cubic feet of capacity. That’s handy if you happen to be having a pool party or if you happen to want to save on utility bills. If you can stand to let the dirty pile grow into a full load, you will save time and money and the environment by running one Samsung-sized load instead of several small ones. You might also save your sanity by having one big laundry day instead of the never-ending chore you would have with smaller dryers.","We like that this clothes dryer offers the option of steam cycles. Steam cycles used to seem like a true luxury for the laundry room, reserved for those with expansive budgets only. It’s still something you will not find in the lowest dryers&#39; price range, but some dryers in the $800-900 range now offer steam features, and that is destined to make your delicate clothes happier for a long time, especially since they will last longer with steam treatment.","Adding moisture to clothes dryers may seem counterintuitive, but it actually has some wonderful effects. The cycles work by adding steam inside the dryers at just the right time, which can act as a sanitizer and eliminate odors. It also has a softening effect and can reduce wrinkling. The softening and de-wrinkling impact of steam can work for dry clothing that has set-in wrinkles, so if you forget a load, you don’t have to iron or re-clean it. You can just pop it into a steam cycle in your Samsung dryer and it will come out wrinkle-free and as fresh as a daisy.","If your washer does not sanitize your clothing, dryers will pick up the slack if it is the Samsung DV410AEW/XAA. This is among the dryers certified by the NSF to kill 99.9 percent of household germs. This will be a great comfort for germophobes and anyone else that wants a certified clean.","Moisture sensors are a tremendous innovation for dryers, and this Samsung unit has one, meaning it can estimate how much water is left in the load and adjust cycle times accordingly. This will save a ton of resources by stopping loads early if they are done early. Older dryers ran on to the end of the cycle whether the clothing was dry or not.","These Samsung dryers have other energy-saving innovations as well, including a signal to check filters that is displayed on a regular basis. This is to remind users that the lint trap should be cleared after each use to help dryers operate efficiently.","We love the variety of cycles with these Samsung dryers. You can instruct your machine to care for very specific types of loads, including Air Fluff, Delicates, Heavy Duty, Normal, Perm Press, Steam Refresh, Steam Wrinkle Care, Time Dry and Wrinkle Prevent.","The wrinkle prevention feature is a wonderful boon to anyone who hates ironing. This feature can offer up to 90 minutes of intermittent tumbling at the end of a cycle, so that even when your cycle has ended, your clothing will not be allowed to settle and wrinkle. The My Cycle function also is pretty cool. You can have these Samsung dryers remember the ideal dryness level, temperature and time of a cycle you use often. When you need that cycle you only have to press one button.","And this unit has oodles of inner beauty. The stainless steel drum is built to last, so you will not have to worry about chipping or discoloration. Some users will not notice how quiet this machine is. The tendency is to notice dryers’ noise levels only when they are too high, but this unit is designed to be whisper quiet.","“My wife had to check on the machines when she was washing, just to make sure they were still running. These are the quietest washer and dryer we have ever owned,” wrote one owner."]},"id":"7b3d2b5a-9843-4ade-ae25-59aff8778154","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"2a5500da-3958-4d2a-9adb-bdaf6018d8d6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In the realm of designing dryers, Samsung added some great creature comforts. The drum light means fewer lost socks, and we love this particular LED display.

We’re guessing this machine will be pretty fascinating to little ones, with its spaceship styling. That is where the child lock comes in. You just press the Temperature and Time buttons for a few seconds together and the controls will be immobilized. You can even set the child lock when the load is already in motion."]},"id":"43140064-481c-4e80-b203-e6711788adb0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Cycle Selection"},"id":"0c7d5df1-d9c6-41b0-9913-cfafee4af984","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This unit comes with a drying rack included.

Stuffed toys benefit from this set-up too. The critters in question will still be recognizable to your child after their time in the dryer.","The matching pedestal and stacking kit cost extra, but we like to know those options exist for dryers.

Those of us accustomed to the familiar rattle and click of the selection dial on the old-style dryers might be a little intimidated by the soft-touch buttons and LED displays of this Samsung unit. It’s all very sophisticated, and if it breaks there will likely be panic. It’s nice to know that the control panel is backed by a warranty that is twice as long as most competitors.
