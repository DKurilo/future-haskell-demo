The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-mini-fridges\">Mini Fridges</a> here.</em>","The Haier HCR17W is a lightweight, quiet and easily stored compact refrigerator. It has 1.7 cubic feet of storage and a small profile.","This mini fridge is a petite 18.87 x 17.87 x 19.37 inches, so you can fit it quite easily in tight spaces like on countertops, under desks and in RVs. The shape is a compact cube. You could place it inconspicuously in a work area, garage or bedroom. At only 34.2 pounds, it is quite easy to move from place to place. The flat back and flush panels make it an easy fit in difficult spaces, but it requires some space in the back for ventilation. This small and quiet unit is a good choice when privacy is a concern, such as if you need to store temperature-sensitive medication or breast milk.","The interior shape of the HCR17W is irregular. The bottom shelf is only half the depth of the top shelf to accommodate the compressor. Also, the freezer compartment juts into the top compartment. You could easily fit a plate on the top shelf and a row of condiments along the bottom shelf. The top wire shelf slides out for convenient access. The door compartment is large enough to fit a half gallon of milk or 2-liter bottle of soda, along with two cans of soda and two or three condiments on the bottom portion.","The exterior finish is white, and it has white trim and a recessed handle. The compressor cooling is quiet, and it can quickly bring food to as low as 34 degrees Fahrenheit. It doesn&#39;t have an interior light, which may be inconvenient in poorly lit areas like garages. The half-width, coil-cooled freezer can quickly reach freezing temperatures, and the unit includes an ice cube tray.","The HCR17W mini refrigerator is Energy Star qualified and uses 315 kwh per year. This is a good fit as a small fridge for an RV, a cubicle or remote locations that require low energy use. It only requires a 15-amp outlet and proper grounding.","The Haier HCR17W is a compact, quiet and very portable mini fridge. This unit offers discreet storage for your office, RV, garage or tight spaces."]},"id":"b56181fc-6233-458e-b943-38f2e4a7f392","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64613","url":"/haier-hcr17w-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-01T16:59:52Z","datePublished":"2015-05-01T16:59:52Z","name":"Haier HCR17W","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
