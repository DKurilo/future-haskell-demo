The Ruud RGPS12EARJR is designed specifically for operation in the many, different spaces a furnace may go. With a capable heating input of 120,000 BTU, this unit will prove sufficient for heating homes of all sizes.","The Ruud RGPS12EARJR utilizes a patented heat exchanger, which wrings every scrap of heat from the gas it circulates for an 80 percent AFUE rating. The exchanger is constructed using both stainless and aluminized steel for maximum protection against corrosion. Due to the heat exchange being continuously exposed to fluctuations in temperatures, this can cause gradual wear on the elements and reduce their efficiency at attracting heat. By reducing corrosion, this heating furnace effectively increases its life by a matter of years.","When it comes to compact spaces or those that call for a horizontal high-efficiency furnace, the Ruud RGPS12EARJR is an optimal unit due to its versatility. The design of the furnace requires no field conversion when converting between upflow and horizontal angles. Combined with its left and right side gas and electric inlet connections, you can easily fit this device into any utility space.","The warranty ensures your purchase will last for years and effectively recuperate the expense of this best furnace. All parts on this unit are covered for a period of five years, when manufacturer’s defects are most likely to occur. After that, the heat exchanger itself is protected for up to 20 years. These warranties are only valid when your furnace is installed by a certified and licensed HVAC technician. Due to the risks associated with improper do-it-yourself installations, this increases the potential for sensitive parts to break or malfunction.","The Ruud RGPS12EARJR is a reliable and long-lasting furnace, augmented largely by its versatile design and lengthy warranty. If you’re constrained by the dimensions of your furnace space, this device may prove compact enough to suit even the tightest of spaces, with no required field conversion. Combined with its lengthy warranty and patented heat exchange, you could see a remarkable reduction in utility bills over a very short period of time."]},"id":"c10de34e-65e0-49e9-ac5e-a7e33070e337","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59562","url":"/ruud-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-05-20T13:40:26Z","datePublished":"2014-05-20T13:40:26Z","name":"Ruud RGPS12EARJR","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.
