This fitness treadmill offers a great variety of programs that will break up a dull routine, and the unit provides a grip and telemetric heart rate monitor so you can meet your fitness goals.","Many people pass up the option of working out on a treadmill because they assume it will be a monotonous workout. The Schwinn 860 treadmill, however, brings variety to its runners with 20 workout programs, including:"]},"id":"61d9d090-cce0-423a-b764-9c7ac975f3ed","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Course profiles","Target heart-rate control","5K and 10K courses","Custom workouts"],"type":"ul"},"id":"78237e41-a91c-4c4c-8f8e-d01d93201aaa","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Each of these programs adjusts the speed and incline of the treadmill automatically, so you don’t have to worry about fussing with the buttons, allowing you to focus on your workout and meeting your fitness goals. If you do decide to manually control the speed and incline throughout your workout, the buttons are located conveniently on either side of the console. When working out, many prefer to listen to music, read a book or stare aimlessly ahead. We wish this treadmill had built in speakers and a USB cord. We did appreciate that this fitness treadmill included the simple addition of a prominent magazine or bookrack.","The design of the Schwinn 860 treadmill is a bit dated, but it provides all the basic features you need. The console and handlebars are placed at a lower height, which is great if you want to gaze over it at the TV. It is amazing what a few inches can do for your stride and comfort level when you&#39;re on a treadmill. This treadmill, for example, has a deck size of 20 by 58 inches, a few inches smaller in comparison to the average 22-by-60-inch deck size of other treadmills. The overall length and width of this treadmill may pose a problem for taller users or those with longer strides.","The deck folds up against the console for storage when it&#39;s not in use, but the 300-pound weight of this Schwinn treadmill would make it impossible for many to take advantage of this space-saving feature if not for the SoftDrop technology. SoftDrop uses hydraulic technology, so when you are ready to use your fitness treadmill, you simply undo the latch that secures the treadmill and the deck gently lowers itself to the ground.","The 860 fitness treadmill is also equipped with a magnetic safety key and clothing clip. Without the key securely in place, the treadmill will not turn on, which is an excellent feature if you have children in the house. When you pull the safety key out in an emergency, the treadmill stops operating, but unlike many of its competitors, it will not shut down the power completely. In order to totally power down the machine, you must crouch to access the power button located inconveniently on the front, bottom panel. We did appreciate that the foot rails run the length of the treadmill, however.","The user manual provided with the Schwinn 860 has fantastic assembly diagrams, but there are, unfortunately, only a couple of them. And, if you are a textual learner and not a visual learner, then you may have trouble interpreting the images. We suggest, as does the manual, that you recruit at least one other person to help you move and assemble your new treadmill, as it is quite heavy.","Schwinn does have a customer support phone number for you to call, but make sure you only have issues with your treadmill during weekdays, as they are closed on weekends. If you do run into a problem, however, Schwinn also has a support email. We were disappointed that this treadmill company did not offer live chat support, which would be the best option for quick answers to your problems.","When a company does not supply a lengthy warranty on its product, one has to wonder if they have confidence in their product. The warranty for the Schwinn 860, compared to many other treadmills in its class, is quite disappointing. The frame and motor have a 10-year warranty; electronics one-year; parts two-years; wear items 90-days and labor 90-days. While 10-years may seem like a long time (and it is), other treadmill companies offer a lifetime warranty on their frames and motors. We wish the motor, at least, had a higher warranty."]},"id":"8c97aa87-ab9a-4038-a147-57e87b769463","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"24b5dc37-33f4-439d-a259-a4b0fa91d0d0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although we were disappointed with the warranty, safety features and lack of live chat support, the Schwinn 860 treadmill is still one of the better treadmills on the market today.
