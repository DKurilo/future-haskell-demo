Garment Designer adds several interesting features to standard <a href=\"/best-embroidery-software\">pattern-design software</a> options. Notably, machine knitters benefit from the program’s ability to translate knitting instructions from the patterns created. The program has also been outfitted with the ability to set preferences and save points, and a print preview feature lets you format the sheets and prepare for how much paper the pattern will require.","Garment Designer lets you start with an industry-standard size and adjust from there, or enter the desired measurements for a perfect fit. The program generates a sloper, which is a basic pattern that fits the specified body measurements, and a grid feature helps you get a sense of the scale. Features that pertain to sleeves, neckline and body style can be added and adjusted in this phase. ","After the sloper is generated, users can tweak it to an individual’s specific shape. There is also an option for Simple or Better Fit slopers, the latter of which is better for less typical body types. The sloper acts as a guide during the pattern-making process, but it can be turned off at any time to give an unobstructed view of the pattern itself. <a href=\"/dress-shop-quick-start-review\">Dress Shop Quick Start</a> offers many of these tools but it also includes a yardage calculator to help you know how much fabric you will need for your project.","TGarment Designer packs in a wide range of features, such as the ability to view a top piece and a bottom piece simultaneously to envision how an outfit will look. The click-and-drag feature lets you adjust the contours and angles of a piece to create a perfect fit. Seam allowances, extensions, hems and facings can all be incorporated into the pattern. The software automatically adjusts sleeve cap measurements when adjustments to the armhole are made, and adding darts to a pattern contour the fit of tops, pants and dresses. Additionally, you can add ribbed fabric and bands of color to a piece to see what the finished design will look like while it is on screen, and the program knows to remove those details when the time comes to chart and print the pattern, to keep the finished pattern as clean and easy to read as possible."]},"id":"1a016a40-ddae-462c-93ad-14f38aead9df","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61205","url":"/garment-designer-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-11-18T17:05:08Z","datePublished":"2014-11-18T17:05:08Z","name":"Garment Designer v2.5","synopsis":"Garment Designer 2.5 from Cochenille is a program that creates sewing and knitting patterns for garments that you design yourself.
