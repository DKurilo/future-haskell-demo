You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Frigidaire Professional FPID2495QF <a href=\"/best-dishwashers\">dishwasher</a> allows you to adjust the racks and tines to fit an assortment of dishes. It even has stemware holders that secure delicate glasses in the machine. The unit holds up to 14 place settings with the ability to adjust the racks to fit odd-shaped items.","This unit includes several energy-efficient wash options that lengthen the time of cycles. The normal cycle on this model runs for 195 minutes, which is significantly longer than cycle times on other machines in our lineup. It uses a soil sensor, or what it coins as DishSense technology, to automatically adjust the cycle times based on the soil level of the water. While it is certified by ENERGY STAR, the dishwasher has an estimated annual operating cost of $31.","The Frigidaire dishwasher has a wide selection of wash cycles and options. With seven cycles, including quick, normal, heavy, rinse only, favorite cycle, china crystal and energy saver cycles, you can program this dishwasher to clean all kinds of different dishes. It also includes three wash options you can add to the cycles, which include a National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) sanitizing option, a high-temperature wash and heated drying.","Unfortunately, this dishwasher lacks wash zones or the ability to only run just the upper or lower rack of the unit. However, it includes multiple drying options. You can select to dry your dishes using heat or allow them to air dry. The air dry option serves as an energy-efficient alternative to drying your dishes.","One of the best features of this dishwasher is its flexible design and ease of use. You can adjust the two racks and fold down tines to create more room for your dishes. The unit has three spray arms that help reach every dish. With several convenience features, operating the dishwasher is easy. This integrated dishwasher has a 24-hour delay start option so that you can run your dishwasher during off-peak hours. With a status light, a child lock and hidden touch-sensitive controls, you can monitor your cycles and prevent your children from disrupting the cycle.","With a stainless steel tub, the material serves as both an insulator and a heat source, making the dishwasher quiet and energy-efficient. When running, this stainless steel dishwasher measures at 49 decibels, which is fairly quiet for a dishwasher. You can purchase this dishwasher with an exterior made of stainless steel as well. The unit comes with a manual filter that requires regular cleanings.","While this built-in dishwasher has a variety of wash cycles, options and convenience features, it has a short warranty. Frigidaire covers the labor, parts, racks, electronics, and tub and door liner for only one year after you purchase the unit. If you need to contact the company, its website lists contact information for its phone, email and live chat."]},"id":"b2885a93-aff4-4782-ad3b-2bd46df3e407","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1a937889-f553-4ca5-89bc-98d3fccf3903","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the warranty on this unit is short, the quality, features and design of the unit make it a good option.
