In addition to being water resistant, it also offers VOX operation. This allows you hands-free operation, so you can keep your hands on the fishing pole instead of having to use them to tell your buddy that you just caught a big one. For added hands-free convenience, this device comes with a headset jack.","If you are concerned about the ring of your walkie talkie sounding too much like the ring of your cell phone, worry no more. This walkie talkie offers you the ability to choose from five different call alert tones. This device also comes with a silent mode operation which will send out a vibration instead of an alert tone to let you know you have an incoming call. This feature is also useful if you are trying to keep from making a lot of extra noise.","It&#39;s bound to happen: you put your walkie talkie in your pocket, and it bumps up against other objects, pushing buttons and accidentally calling someone else. The LXT114 offers the perfect solution – a keypad lock. It also comes with a keystroke alert tone, which will alert you by tone each time a button on the unit is pressed.","As an added bonus, this handie talkie is packaged using RoHS compliant materials. This means that the units are packaged without the use of lead, an important feature to consider when thinking about your health while you use these devices."]},"id":"654121ed-6278-4f16-bc4b-90f033d77f95","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Emergency Options"},"id":"fc46ef18-6e67-48d0-91ad-e3e7b13dcd30","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Midland LXT112VP device is simple to use and lightweight, so it is not uncomfortable to carry around all day.
