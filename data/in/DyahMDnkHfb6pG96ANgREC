The Cyclone would be close to a perfect beginner helicopter were it not for its long charge times.

Technically, it&#39;s not as precise or aerodynamic as other types of foam, but that doesn&#39;t matter on a quadcopter. Here, durability is king, and the V262 Cyclone is appreciably durable.","Should you push your Cyclone past its limits and shear the foam, there&#39;s an easy fix: epoxy glue. Epoxies like Gorilla Glue expand as they set, which is perfect for the many little air holes that make up EPP foam – the glue can grow into those holes and form a durable bond. Be sure not to use super glue; its chemicals literally melt foam, and you&#39;ll end up with a ruined hull."]},"id":"07f0691b-87e8-4b6b-b057-5300be93c5aa","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"803e5410-f397-4261-b178-2416adbf212e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Having tested $20 mall copters and $150 hobbyist aircraft, flown them indoors and out, and experienced more than our fair share of crashes, we believe that WL Toys&#39; V262 Cyclone is the best remote control helicopter a beginner can buy.
