Although it doesn’t have everything you might expect from the best webcam, like the Logitech HD Pro C920, it’s a great option for those who need high resolutions, quick frame rates and top-notch still shooting at a low price.","The video specifications of the AW615 are perhaps its strongest features. There aren’t many web cameras in our lineup that can shoot in 1080p at 30 frames per second (fps). With that speed plus a glass lens, your video will be clear and smooth on most screens, avoiding the jerky look of lower frame rates. When streaming with this webcam, the HD quality will of course be influenced by your internet connection.","Still image resolution is also impressive on the AW615. In fact, it’s the second-highest on our lineup at 12 megapixels. The manual focus type lets you set the focus exactly how you want. Like all webcams with high megapixel counts, it uses interpolation on each image. Interpolation is a process by which the camera uses actual pixels as a reference and mimics their information to add extra pixels not actually captured by the camera. Adding these pixels artificially increases the resolution.","Based on the technical specifications, video from this webcam should be crisp and smooth. But specs aren’t the only factor behind great image quality. The caliber of the lens and sensor can have quite an effect on how your video looks. Fortunately, the AW615 lives up to our expectations with well-lit, clear video that is free from distortions.","Despite its solid video performance, this webcam is light in the features department. It lacks face tracking, digital zoom and motion detection. However, it does have a noise reduction feature that will reduce or eliminate distracting background noises, like running air conditioning. Basic tilt and pan functionality let you point the webcam exactly where you need.","Ausdom ships the AW615 with a one-year warranty. You can also contact the company to ask questions about the webcam, or check out the FAQs section and user manual on the company website."]},"id":"e44f6142-0015-4d0c-ab20-d774d71b6082","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"517396a7-7ebd-4b0d-8aec-57239e26af9e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Ausdom AW615 is a compact webcam that features full 1080p HD image resolution at 30 frames per second and a few basic features.
