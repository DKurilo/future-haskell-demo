It includes a fast-freeze feature, external controls and adjustable shelves. This makes it a versatile upright freezer that is great for family use.","This freezer has external temperature controls so you don’t have to open the door and lose cold air and energy while adjusting the temperature. It also has a fast-freeze feature to activate a rapid drop in temperature if you have frozen food that has been out for a while. This upright freezer comes with a temperature alarm to let you know if the freezer’s temperature is too warm. The fast-freeze feature would come in handy in this situation. Activating it immediately after a rise in temperature will help the food retain freshness.","This Whirlpool freezer is frost free, which is not an uncommon feature for freezers these days. Anyone who has had to empty out a freezer to defrost it will appreciate this feature. You won’t have to deal with a high incidence of frost on your food either, which helps it taste better.","One small complaint with this freezer is that it doesn’t come with a reversible door, which limits its versatility when it comes to placement in the basement or other out-of-the-way area. It will have to be placed strategically to get bulky items in and out. However, this freezer has a generous capacity of 16 cubic feet. The manufacturers estimate that it will store food for roughly six people. Our tests confirmed this. We were able to comfortably fit many various-sized boxes on the shelves without a problem.","The Whirlpool freezer has three adjustable shelves and a bin in the bottom that works well for bulky items that don’t fit well on the shelves above. The adjustability is nice so you can customize the space to your specific needs. We were able to fit many odd-shaped boxes in areas all over in the freezer. The door bins are spacious and will store items, like frozen dinners, that you want easy access to."]},"id":"38d1d102-b7ce-44ad-b49b-7af731d2689d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"67132e58-5511-4a04-b8ad-5347dac310d0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Whirlpool WZF56R16DW is a great upright freezer that will set off an alarm to let you know when the temperature rises to a level that isn’t safe for your food.
