You can get more one-minute intervals of cook time by pressing that button as many times as necessary so you get the full level of cooking required for the food item you are heating.","The manual for this countertop microwave gives detailed information about using each preset program. This includes the recommended serving size to reheat and exact instructions on covering or preparing the food, such as using a fork to puncture a potato or hot dog before baking and making sure to cover a plate to help contain splatter. Another useful tip – add a little water to fresh vegetables before cooking them.","The auto defrost for this compact microwave oven has preset times and power levels for three meat classifications: meat (which includes beef, lamb and pork), poultry and fish. For each of these categories, you can enter a weight of between 0.1 and 6 pounds. During the defrost cycle, a tone sounds indicating it’s time to check, separate and turn the food. Press Start to resume the cycle. If there is something else you need to defrost that doesn’t fall within these three categories, the manual gives some suggestions and recommends using power level three.","One of the most appealing features on this appliance is the ability to multi-stage cook. You can select different times and power levels and let the compact microwave do all the work. Meanwhile, you don&#39;t have to stick around and supervise. Within the multi-stage cooking, you can choose three stages. The microwave sounds a tone at the end of each stage before automatically moving on to the next stage."]},"id":"06269615-7174-479e-881c-4b00f0f298c0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"3474a9ed-cfce-448c-a7c9-d02b4f47234d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/crwVvpzWqJTAUurbgjz6NV.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Using this compact microwave oven is as easy as pushing a single button; in fact, one button is all that’s truly required when using the preset programs.

All you have to do is press Cook Time, enter the desired time and press Start. If you want another power level, enter the time, press Cook Power, enter the power level and press Start. To set the compact microwave up with multiple stages, just repeat entering the time and power level before pressing Start. If you want to have the first stage as defrost, set the power level to three.","Another excellent feature on this countertop microwave oven is a locking capacity, which is especially important if there are children in the household. Countertop microwaves, as opposed to over-the-range products, are more likely to be within reach of curious youngsters. Since running the compact microwave empty is not a good thing, it’s best to keep children from playing with the buttons when they should not. Moreover, for safety reasons, young children should never be actually operating any type of oven or trying to remove hot food.","To keep kids safe, hold down the Start button for five seconds to lock the control panel. Do the same thing to unlock the buttons. This will prevent any accidental empty runs, which could damage your compact microwave oven, and even more importantly, will protect children from painful burns if they try to cook something themselves and accidentally spill the hot contents.<br/>One of the features this compact microwave lacks is a kitchen timer, which is found on other products we reviewed. The only solution to this problem is to purchase a separate timer. Though there is no timer, there is an illuminated clock, which is easy to set and read. Press Clock Set, enter the time and then press Clock Set again.","As compact microwave ovens go, this 700-watt version has average power and capacity. With only 0.7 cubic feet of interior space, not all casserole dishes or large dinner plates will fit flat on the turntable. This compact microwave was not designed to be used for large quantities of food. High quantities will not hurt the microwave, but it will not be as efficient as other, larger microwave ovens."]},"id":"e927f39a-6eb4-4bb0-aef7-d56553ced1fb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Convenience"},"id":"4bf9d615-c4a7-47ef-a1f0-a5b2bc9756d8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/xQgnzh2xSMzzTmXTRbWxfU.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"This compact microwave is available in two colors, black and white.
