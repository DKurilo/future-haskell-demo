This unit comes with two different burner sizes for cooking more than one thing at a time. Additionally, it offers the convenience of a window and interior light for its oven.","This electric range offers two 8-inch burners that are ideal for larger cooking jobs such as boiling jars to can fresh salsa. It also has two smaller, 6-inch burners that are optimal for smaller jobs such as simmering barbecue sauce to go on your tasty ribs.","This unit is equipped with a Keep Warm setting to keep foods thoroughly heated after they are cooked. This option gives you have more freedom to cook meals a bit earlier than normal and still have time to do a few other things while you are waiting for your dinner guests to arrive.","The Frigidaire FFEF3011LW comes with two oven racks that you can place in five different positions so that you can cook several different dishes at the same time. By having the opportunity to change the rack positions, you also have the opportunity to cook larger items such as large roast or ham for a family dinner.","Having the flexibility to flip a switch and turn on the oven light to view your baking food items is a luxury that not every electric range has. However, the Frigidaire FFEF3011LW is equipped with an interior oven light and a viewing window that allows you to check the progress of your cooking food items.","This electric range comes with a drawer underneath the oven for storing pots and pans. With its self-storage system, you will never have to worry about having cluttered cupboards again. Additionally, you can fill those empty cupboards with your cooking and baking ingredients.","One feature that we really liked about this electric range is that you can remove each of the knobs to make it easier to clean the range. Any time you are preparing food, a clean kitchen is essential!","This electric oven is also equipped with an auto shutoff feature. If you ever forget to turn your oven off and it stays on longer than 12 hours, it will automatically shut itself off. This should give you peace of mind when you are considering the safety of your family.","Frigidaire wants to answer all its customers&#39; questions and make sure that you know how to operate its products. That is why they offer telephone and email support that gives you the chance to converse with someone one on one. They also provide a user manual and list of FAQs on their website.
