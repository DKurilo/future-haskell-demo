You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Klipsch Synergy Sub-10 <a href=\"/best-home-subwoofers\">home subwoofer</a> offers decent sound and solid power. However, this down-firing woofer definitely markets itself as an experience over a power house.","The Klipsch Synergy Sub-10 puts out 200 watts of continuous power, making it a strong home subwoofer. At its peak, the amplifier can handle up to 420 watts of power. The speaker reaches 115dB of maximum volume, recreating a rock concert in your living room.","The Klipsch Synergy Sub-10 was made for movies, dipping down to 28Hz where large explosions and rumbling earthquakes live. And if you&#39;re listening to rock or hip-hop, this speaker handles music fairly well. However, since it can only reach as high as 120Hz, this sub struggles with melodic bass tracks and kicks the higher frequency notes to your mid-level speakers. Suddenly, Marcus Miller&#39;s funky bass solo travels from the sub in the corner of your room to the mids in the center of your system.","The Klipsch Synergy Sub-10 is a down-firing home subwoofer, which increases the ground-shaking effect of its powerful output. This does not affect the volume level, since bass frequencies are omnidirectional. Be aware that the wiring can come loose over an extended period of time, so you will want to be careful before cranking this sub to its max. The ground-pounding effect of this sub can end up damaging the internal components.","The subwoofer speaker, driver and amplifier are encased in a smooth cabinet with rounded edges. The cabinet rests on four arced, protruding legs, giving it a unique and modern look. This sleek appearance is augmented by its matte black finish and titanium accents.","Klipsch Synergy Sub-10 home subwoofers have a number of excellent features. Of its features, the most impressive, but by no means unique, is a signal-sensing automatic on/off setting that puts the sub into standby mode after a period of inactivity. An LED light on the front of the cabinet indicates whether the subwoofer is in active or standby mode. These home subwoofers are also equipped with rotating dials to adjust the volume and crossover frequency and a toggle switch to set the phase at either zero or 180 degrees.","There are several ways to connect your Klipsch Synergy Sub-10 to your audio/video receiver, depending on your receiver&#39;s outputs and configuration. You can run a single cable from your receiver to the Sub-10’s LFE or left-channel RCA input, or you can use the left and right inputs (and two cables) for a stereo signal. The sub’s high-level speaker binding inputs let you connect your receiver&#39;s main speaker and route the signal to your other speakers with the sub’s two left and right high-level outputs. This configuration is especially helpful if your receiver does not have an LFE output.","Klipsch Synergy Sub-10 home subwoofers are covered by a five-year warranty on the electronic components and a two-year warranty on the internal amplifier. The Klipsch website has many options for technical support, including an FAQs page, downloadable product manuals and a user forum. There&#39;s also an email address and a number for phone support."]},"id":"79d915b4-216f-4c39-8067-3010adb2c0b4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"694505ea-7c8f-4563-8edf-f41573621f22","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Klipsch Synergy Sub-10 is one of many great audio components that this company manufactures.
