The resulting reports may include the following information: age, current address, up to 20 year address history, phone numbers, bankruptcies, tax liens, judgments, property ownership, relatives, roommates, aliases, maiden names, neighbors, marriages, divorces, DEA registrants, and website ownership. You can add a national criminal check to this report for $10.","<em>People Finder Report ($9.95/ea)</em> - Searches through information from the following databases: People, Real Property, Death, Divorce and Marriage."],"type":"ul"},"id":"11f0ecbc-faab-45bd-b54f-af4a81b0af17","type":"list"},{"data":{"items":["<em>People/Background ($9.95/ea)</em> - Explores 10 databases, including some proprietary databases, with access to 2,268,819,679 records.

This report may include misdemeanors, felonies, arrest warrants, sexual offenses, physical description, age and gender. Unfortunately, you cannot see if any reports are available without paying first.","<em>Bankruptcies &amp; Liens ($9.95/ea)</em> - This report includes: Bankruptcy filings, federal and state tax liens, and civil judgments for businesses and individuals by name or address. Results may include name, address, liability amount, status and more. We question how up to date this search is, because we typed in the names of several people that have filed for bankruptcy protection within the last 5 years and got a &#34;No Matches Found&#34; message for these people.","<em>Property ($9.95/ea)</em> - You can search real property records in 42 states to get information such as ownership, site address, owner&#39;s address, phone number, value, date last sold, and the assessor&#39;s parcel number. Again, we question the accuracy of some of these databases, we conducted searches using known property owners names and came up with no matches.","<em>Marriage ($ 9.95/ea)</em> - Here you can search marriage records for California (1960-1985), Colorado (1975-2000), Florida (1970-1999), Kentucky (1973-1999), Maine (1892-1996), Nevada (1968-2000), Texas (1968-1998) and Utah (1800-1999). These reports may include bride and groom&#39;s name, bride and groom&#39;s age at time of marriage, county/state and filling number.","<em>Death ($ 9.95/ea)</em> - Searches the Social Security Administration Death Master File for records of deceased people who possessed social security numbers and whose death has been reported to the Social Security Administration. Results may include name, date of birth, date of death, and last place of residence. However, this search does not include a death certificate.","<em>Divorce ($ 9.95/ea)</em> - Searches divorce records for Colorado (1975-2000), Florida (1970-1999), Nevada (1968-2000) and Texas (1968-1998).
