Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Dirt Devil Accucharge 15.6V Cordless Bagless Stick Vacuum was very competitive in our suction tests, and it costs less than $80. This <a href=\"/best-stick-vacuums\">stick vac</a> converts from carpet to hardwood with a simple on/off brushroll switch, which is a great option to help keep your floors free from unsightly scuff marks.","Another nice feature about the Accucharge is that it constantly monitors the battery when it’s charging. Once the battery is fully charged, power is reduced to a trickle to maintain the battery without drawing extra power. This system reduces energy use when the vac is resting in the charger and can help extend battery life.","The Dirt Devil Accucharge 15.6V was above average when we compiled all our tests for an overall score. There were vacuums with much more suction, like the <a href=\"/hoover-linx-review\">Hoover LiNX</a>, but this one did well, especially considering its price. The Accucharge removed the sawdust on the carpet in six passes, which was about average. It performed much better on hardwood, however. With its easy brushroll switch, it completely removed sawdust from the hardwood surface in only four passes, which ranks it near the top. The Accucharge was nearly perfect when vacuuming pet hair. This stick vac lost points, though, because it lacks a removable hand vacuum, a common feature on stick vacuums.","The Dirt Devil Accucharge excelled in overall ease of use compared to other stick vacuums we tested. The stick vac moves around with little effort, and the swivel steering on the vacuum head makes changing course seamless. One feature that makes this stick vac stand out is its folding handle. The Accucharge folds in half when it’s not in use, which gives you a lot more space in your hall closet. When folded, it sits directly on the charging stand, allowing it to charge overnight so it has power whenever you need it.","The dirt cup wasn’t hard to clean – it pops right off and has a button that snaps the cup open so you can pour the debris directly into the trash without getting your hands dirty. It also comes with HEPA filtration, a rare feature for a stick vacuum, which means it removes nearly 100 percent of irritating dust particles from the air when the filter is in use. Regarding the charge time of six hours, the Dirt Devil Accucharge was the slowest, but for overall runtime it comes in fourth."]},"id":"2b951eeb-e6c5-4fad-97fd-a66572abd84e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2d73fcaf-db45-48d1-b8ea-7fb878b9b0d4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The best thing about the Dirt Devil Accucharge 15.6V is that it provides a high level of performance and great ease of use at an affordable price.
