The original review is below, but check out our current top products about </em><a href=\"/best-gas-cooktops\"><em>Gas Cooktops</em></a><em> here.</em>","A major complaint about gas cooktops is the lack of temperature control. They produce scorching temperatures quickly for speedy boiling times, as well as for sautéing and frying, making them the typical preference for restaurants and professional cooks. However, they often don’t do well with the lower temperatures necessary for simmering. The BlueStar 30-inch drop-in gas cooktop covers all bases for temperature controls. While low temperatures are the Achilles heel of most gas cooktops, the BlueStar simmer burners hold low, steady temperatures for delicate foods, simmering and melting, holding temperatures at an impressive 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Average gas burners have an output of around 9,000 BTUs, or British Thermal Units. The high-powered burners in the BlueStar blasts out 22,000 BTUs for incredible heating times.","This compact 30-inch unit will fit neatly on your kitchen counter top. This gas cooktop model is also available in 36-inch model with five burners. Regardless of how much space you have in your kitchen, be sure to measure your countertops and cut out size before installing or purchasing any type of cooktop. Electric and gas cooktops require a minimum distance 2 inches from the wall or the edge of the counter for safety. This BlueStar model is 7 inches high, 30 inches wide and 22 inches long. It weighs a hefty 190 pounds because its cooktop cabinet is 20 inches deep.","The sealed burners make cleaning food messes easy by eliminating extra parts, but still require care during the occasional boil over. This is a great feature if you cook large meals often and don&#39;t always have time to be picky about cleaning. When you do want to deep clean, the hinged top makes the burners and surface easily accessible. Professional cooks say they prefer gas cooktops because they can see the flame working on the food, but classic pilots can extinguish and be a hassle to relight. The BlueStar’s automatic electronic ignition and re-ignition keeps the flame burning even when spills occur. The heavy-duty control knobs are smooth and easy to clean. They require a push-to-turn motion to prevent slips and temperature changes, a good safety feature for households with curious children.","Full motion grates allow you to slide cookware across the surface without scratching, spilling or tipping over your cookware in the middle of preparation. Unlike electric burners with designated burner sizes, these stable full grates accommodate all sizes of cookware from large soup pots to delicate saucepans.","The installation is easy, but to keep the full year parts and labor warranty, a qualified gas installer or service technician must install the BlueStar. Gas cooktops are wildly efficient, but they can certainly be dangerous if installed incorrectly. This cooktop only uses natural gas and does not have an LP converter for propane. Be sure your kitchen has gas hookups before purchasing or installing this cooktop.","The BlueStar 30-inch drop-in gas cooktop delivers powerful heat for speedy boiling and gentle low temperatures for melting and simmering more delicate foods. The size options suit kitchens of all sizes and the re-ignition feature keep the flames going during messes and spills."]},"id":"867fb110-2105-4ce5-a4d8-fb1a01c9e86d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_57795","url":"/bluestar-gas-cooktop-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-10-16T13:17:32Z","datePublished":"2013-10-16T13:17:32Z","name":"BlueStar 30-inch RBCT304BSS","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks in our lineup.
