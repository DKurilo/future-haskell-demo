This RC boat is quick and a joy to drive. It is a higher-end boat that appeals mostly to hobbyists or boating enthusiasts.","It grips the water incredibly well, and you don&#39;t have to worry about flipping it. The boat has smooth turns and makes them with ease. It is extremely fast and is a ton of fun to drive. With the RC boat you can reach top speeds of 25 miles per hour, which is faster than several other RC boats on the market. It is a perfect boat to race, or it can serve as a way just to kill time on the weekends.","The boat is fitted with a 1800kV brushless, water-cooled motor. However, the boat&#39;s quick speed comes with a cost â€“ a cost of battery life. The boat only has a runtime of six minutes, which isn&#39;t as long as that of some other boats.","The shorter runtime can also be attributed to the boat&#39;s massive size. It is 26 inches long and 9 inches wide. The large size makes it harder to travel with and practically impossible to use in a pool. However, despite its large size, the boat tackles the water with ease. It features dual propellers, and you get an extremely fast run with the Wildcat RC boat.","Aquacraft markets this radio controlled boat as ready to run. However, it doesn&#39;t include batteries for this boat or for the included transmitter. The boat requires a 2,100-3,400-mAh LiPo battery, and the receiver needs four AA batteries. You&#39;ll also have to pick up a charger for the boat battery. This all comes at an extra expense to you and results in less time out in the water with the boat and more time spent shopping for supplies for it. A display stand is included with the boat, which is a nice way to show off the high-quality design of the boat, but it would be nice if a battery were thrown in as well.","The RC boat has a 90-day warranty and includes a user manual. If you lose the manual or it gets wet, you can download one on Aquacraft&#39;s website. You can find customer reviews for the boat and watch some videos of the model in action online, too."]},"id":"788403c5-6d2e-4cc5-baef-4c7ec2ce26f0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a92363cc-2d4a-4523-b16d-5ffacf42da5a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Aquacraft Wildcat RC boat is a fun and fast boat that you&#39;ll have a blast driving.
