You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","You will find true 720p HD quality in the V7 Pro HD Webcam. This <a href=\"/best-webcams\">webcam</a> captures 30 fps video at 720p resolution. Along with HD quality video, this webcam also takes up to 12-megapixel pictures, which is comparable to the best rated webcams that we have reviewed.","Image quality is not an issue for this webcam. However, like most webcams that rank in the lower tier of our lineup, there are usually some deficiencies that keep them from being top rated webcams. In the case of the V7 Pro HD, it’s the total lack of features. This webcam comes equipped with a built-in noise cancelling microphone to keep your audio clean and clear, but that about does it for  features on this webcam.  Features such as video and audio effects are missing along with face tracking and light correction which can be important to maintain quality video in certain situations.","The design of the webcam is nothing to get overly excited about.  The base can fold outward so the webcam has the ability to stand by itself on a desk. It also can also fold back and you can set it on top of a laptop screen, though it doesn’t fit securely. The webcam itself is bolted to the base so it does not have the ability to swivel at all, though this design allows you to tilt the webcam up and down.","The webcam can connect to your computer or laptop via USB. It only comes with a 4-foot cable so where you put your webcam is a bit limited. It does have a CMOS censor that is found in most of the webcams we have reviewed, which we liked.","V7 is good about replying to your concerns via email. It usually takes only a few hours to receive a response which we feel is timely. If you need immediate assistance you can reach V7’s customer service via telephone. The V7 Pro HD is backed by a one-year warranty and is only compatible with Windows 7 and Vista operating systems. This severely limits where you can actually use this webcam."]},"id":"b0fb4421-b18e-42b7-830a-9b12c45a07d9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"aad8744f-a003-485d-9567-a1151b1b7954","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The V7 Pro HD webcam isn’t the best rated webcam that we reviewed, but it does pass the test when it comes to HD quality video.
