You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Haier HWD1500 washer and dryer combination is so innovative and so unique and so impressive in so many ways. It’s also wrong for most users. We included it in our top <a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\">front-loading washers</a>  because it has some great features. An appliance that can both wash and dry clothing is pretty cool. It is worth researching a machine that can do all of that for the same price as a front-load washer alone, but we think the average user would be better off with a more traditional product.","The most obvious difference in features here is the double duty this Haier machine provides. It is a tremendous boon to those who are living in cramped quarters. If you have one tiny closet that needs to become a laundry room, this Haier washing machine and dryer might make a lot of sense. This machine dries clothing by condensing water and releasing it into your sink’s drain rather than venting it.","Users will recognize many of the features from the other front-load washers in our lineup on this Haier unit. For instance, all of the detergent, bleach and fabric softener will be automatically dispensed at the right time, every time. Also, many pains were taken in the design to make sure this appliance runs quietly. There is also an option to delay the start of a cycle by up to nine hours.","The list of features is more abbreviated than for other front-load washers in our lineup, and that is to be expected in a combination unit like this Haier. We think many users will miss some of those features though, especially when it comes to the variety of settings. And there is the factor of size to consider. This front-load washer is small compared to the others, with only 1.7 cubic feet of capacity.","This Haier front-load washer and dryer combination excels in the ease-of-use department based on its basic design. What could be easier than washing and drying in one machine, after all? The concept is pretty great, but we’re not convinced it is for everyone.","We think the average customer will want more versatility in the types of washing and drying cycle options and combinations. Also most loads are complex enough to include some items that may be headed for a line dry and some for the dryer.","This Haier washer still compares pretty well to others in the lineup in some ways though, considering how much more is being packed into this one unit. Designers still found room for child lock and digital display features.","This Haier looks gorgeous and packs a pretty powerful energy savings punch. According to the EPA EnergyGuide label, users will spend only $22 yearly to operate this machine with an electric water heater and $8 annually with a gas water heater.","While we recognize the majority of users will not buy directly from Haier, we still think it is important to note that the company’s website is mostly unhelpful. We had difficulty finding information about this Haier unit really anywhere online, including the manufacturer’s own site. The user manual was nowhere to be found on the Haier site, and the trouble shooting information was not the greatest.","What we did find online was a lot of user reviews, both good and bad. This Haier front-load washer has a reputation for washing well in small quantities but not drying well."]},"id":"4f1c27b8-5710-4c16-8309-14bc93bb61f9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"913d5cb7-87f8-49ae-a881-2fe1327cff9f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Haier HWD1500 will be just right for the right consumer.
