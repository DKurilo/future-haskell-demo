You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Slice cannot compete with the big boys among digital <a href=\"/best-die-cutting-machines\">die cutters</a>, but it is excellent at the basics and makes the whole hobby a lot more portable and even a little more fun.","This extremely compact unit has a handle, an SD card and no need to interact with your computer whatsoever. To those who love to make unique designs for each project, that probably sounds like a drag, but there are perks to buying ready-made designs from Slice. The designs themselves are gorgeous. Also, it is much faster and easier to insert an SD card and push a few buttons than it is to spend hours toiling to get just the right design together on your computer screen. The design SD cards are not cheap, though.","The Slice cuts an impressive array of materials, especially considering its relatively low price. This is great fabric die cutting machine for quilting and any other fabric crafts. It will also handle cardstock, vinyl and vellum just fine. This is not the best die cut machine if you want to work with leather or other heavier materials, though.","We were pleasantly surprised to find that the Slice can draw and emboss. We didn&#39;t really expect it from this compact die cutter. There is very little to customize on the machine. You can make some minor adjustments to the blade pressure, and that is about it. Customization will be less important with this particular die cutting system because it only cuts thin material anyway. There&#39;s no need to adjust much if it is basically doing the same job on every project.","This die cut machine is quite different from most of the units on our lineup in every way. You place the Slice on top of whatever material you are attempting to cut rather than feeding it through the device, like you would with printer-style die cutting machines. That makes for an easy way to decrease wasted material. Once you get the hang of the Slice, you will be adept at placing it in just the right position to allow for the most pattern cuts per page or piece of fabric possible. Many machines do this automatically, but at least the Slice allows one fit-to-page option, even if it is not the most sophisticated.","Slice has decent customer service. It took us a while to find the official site – the Slice brand has changed ownership a few times. The newest owners have made a nice home for the product online, but its support is a little sparse. There are not really all that many customer resources available. The phone number is buried and we didn&#39;t hear back on our emails."]},"id":"659c9d0f-92de-4169-84ae-f4738044d175","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"93e6c4a1-8934-475b-96c2-a835c8ff4e44","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["A lot of people will absolutely love the small-sized Slice, even if it can&#39;t handle the industrial materials and engraving projects that its competitors can.

All of those projects are a lot of fun to do in a group environment.
