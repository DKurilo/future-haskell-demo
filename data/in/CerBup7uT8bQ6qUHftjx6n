On one side, you have a small subwoofer that is beautiful and powerful, and the perfect piece for your home entertainment center. The other story of this subwoofer is a high fail rate with overheating electronics and a poorly constructed enclosure that sometimes rattles when in use.","This home theater subwoofer was designed to shine while watching movies. Its 25Hz low frequency combined with 400 watts of continuous power help drive the low-frequency effects (LFE) in movies throughout your home entertainment room.","When listening to music, the sub does well with steady bass, but the subtleties of melodic bass tracks will be lost on the sub. This is understandable considering the PS312BK is specifically made for reproducing the low-frequency effects (LFE) in films. The Infinity Primus PS312BK lumbers through the LFE moments with surprising clarity and accuracy.","If you do buy an Infinity Primus PS312BK, do not let your curiosity get the best of you. The amp on this sub pumps out more power than the speaker can handle. Throughout various subwoofer reviews, many users complain about a buzzing sound or overheating electronics. The internal circuit box is encased in a plastic box, and even at low settings, the circuits produce a lot of trapped heat.","If the sub fails, you&#39;d better hope it happens within the first two years of ownership while the electronics are still under warranty. If the problem is with the amp, the warranty does not cover this at all, so you&#39;ll either have to buy a new subwoofer or pay for the repairs. Fortunately, the speakers are covered by a five-year warranty, which is longer than the warranty on the electronics. This should put your mind at ease if you experience any speaker conflicts.","Infinity offers email and telephone customer support. Email can only be sent through a contact form on the website but don&#39;t expect a speedy response from customer support. The Infinity Primus PS312BK&#39;s warranty offers five years of coverage for the speaker and two years for the electronics."]},"id":"b9df2e6a-fd01-4016-a7a1-81e4c526cbc3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1bd6d655-94fd-4f04-8435-a8b1b231a5aa","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Infinity Primus PS312BK home subwoofer looks beautiful, and based on the specs, it seems like a great buy.
