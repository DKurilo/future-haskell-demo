This is a disappointment since most of Aimersoft&#39;s DVD utilities are high quality and have a rich array of features. Unfortunately, this Mac DVD copy software is truncated and limited in its usefulness.","The first thing you&#39;ll notice about this Mac DVD copier is that its interface is quite modest. There are only two fields you can manipulate before you begin the copying process. You have the ability to select what drive you will be copying from and which optical drive will burn your disc, but unless you have a Mac with multiple DVD drives, this will always be the same drive.","Once you have the disc you want to copy loaded into the application, all you have to do is click the Start button to begin copying. It is a very easy program to use. However, what you trade for that simplicity is the ability to customize your DVD. You must take all the content on the disc whole. There are no options to only copy the main movie and leave out the menus or special features.","This can be particularly problematic if you&#39;re copying a commercial DVD. Virtually all commercial DVD movies are sold on what&#39;s known as a DVD-9 (or DVD-DL), which holds 9GB of data. Most blank writable DVDs are the smaller DVD-5 discs, which only hold 5GB of information. Since this application has no ability to compress a DVD-9 onto a DVD-5 and you cannot pick and choose which content you wish to copy, you must purchase the more expensive DVD-9 blank discs if you wish to copy a commercial DVD.","You do have the ability to save the content from a DVD onto your local hard drive. However, this ability is limited to copying the raw files and folders on the disc. These files are of limited utility to the average user. Aimersoft’s website claims this software can rip the disc image (ISO file) onto your hard drive; however, in our tests, we could find no such ability."]},"id":"d4e33a4a-6269-4f8e-ba07-316f778fbf0e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"962f97d5-f501-499c-bb71-f9275e777d60","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Aimersoft DVD Copy for Mac is an application with a single function – to copy DVDs.
