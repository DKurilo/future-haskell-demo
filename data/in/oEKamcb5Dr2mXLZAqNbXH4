You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Every time you pay your monthly <a href=\"/best-prepaid-cell-phones\">prepaid cell phone</a> bill with GIV Mobile, eight percent of that payment is sent to a charity of your choice. Every charity, of which there are 36 to pick from, has been pre-screened by GIV as &#34;efficient, transparent and universal,&#34; so you can be sure your money&#39;s going to a good cause. It&#39;s a refreshing take on philanthropy from an industry that, stereotypically, is very money-grubbing. If, for example, you go with the company&#39;s casual-use, $35 plan, you&#39;ll end up giving $2.80 every month, or $33.60 per year – a decent amount of money that would otherwise go straight into some other carrier&#39;s coffers.","GIV Mobile&#39;s prepaid phone plans are surprisingly fair, considering the company is passing along part of each payment to charity. Every plan offers unlimited talk and text, so the only difference is in your data allocation. The average prepaid user will only need the $35 plan, which includes 500MB of data, but for $45 you can upgrade to 2GB. Even heavier users can go to the $65 plan; it&#39;s a $20 bump in price, but it gets you a full 4GB of 4G LTE data.","For all of its impressive pricing on its no-contract cell phone plans, GIV Mobile&#39;s phone selection is rather mediocre. There are no iPhones of any generation, and the beefiest Android entry is the LG G2. Instead of offering the excellent, budget-friendly Moto G, GIV stocks the less compelling Moto E. And while there are plenty of sub-$100 devices you can buy, few are enticing.","Should you purchase a prepaid smartphone from GIV and not like it, returning it will incur a 20 percent restocking fee. For a cheap device like the $49 ZTE Concord, that&#39;s only $10. For a device like the LG G2, you would end up paying over $70 just to return it and replace it with something else."]},"id":"2c1f4e42-81ab-494b-9ff2-cb2411fe56c7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"97fa5d65-3793-4aa3-bbef-3b5a72652081","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Between its potentially expensive restocking fees and its lack of phone payment plans, GIV Mobile isn&#39;t a provider for the indecisive. It&#39;s also missing both daily and pay-as-you-go plans, an absence that may not be deal-breaking, but is certainly disappointing. Fortunately, GIV&#39;s monthly plans are some of the best you&#39;ll find in the prepaid sphere, offering decent rates with a charitable spin. If its offerings meet your needs and GIV Mobile has a phone you like or you&#39;re able to bring your own, T-Mobile-compatible device, this is a company you can feel good supporting."]},"id":"a52ff4d6-25dc-4461-84df-bcd3494cee4b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60198","url":"/giv-mobile-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-08-12T16:35:52Z","datePublished":"2014-08-12T16:35:52Z","name":"GIV Mobile","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":72,"verdict":"If you&#039;re a light data user who wants to give a little extra to charity every month, GIV Mobile is an awesome take on no-contract cell service.
