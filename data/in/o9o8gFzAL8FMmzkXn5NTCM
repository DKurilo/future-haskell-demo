The 18-month battery life is impressive and guarantees you can use the Accusplit long enough to develop healthy and active habits long before the juice is low. This pedometer counts steps, distance and calories. The device stores all of these stats in its seven-day memory so you can track your progress by weeks at a time. If you have a long-term goal, a longer memory may be the best for you. However, we like the seven-day span because it keeps your stats in sizable chunks to measure over the long term."]},"id":"7567879c-0b1f-4c44-a953-e75c9fbc6c24","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/ystJNFimXzpPo94Q8XLGe3.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56367-accusplit-ah190m282.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ystJNFimXzpPo94Q8XLGe3.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"ystJNFimXzpPo94Q8XLGe3","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ystJNFimXzpPo94Q8XLGe3.jpg","alt":""},"id":"fdc0ce92-315d-40e6-be7b-6d603eefe252","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We like the large, dual-window LCD display. The large yellow Mode button toggles between stats when you check your distance, calories or steps. The controls are easy to use and large enough to see without glasses. The protective cover keeps the Accusplit from the elements, though we don&#39;t suggest using it in rainy or moist conditions. Use the metal clip attachment on the cover to secure the pedometer to your hip. Be sure to keep it level with the ground so it can register the swing of your hips to count steps. Paired with a three-way pedometer leash, the clip keeps the Accusplit by your side at all times.","The Accusplit AH190M28 has several reset options as well. The auto reset kicks in every day at 3:50 AM so you can start monitoring your day of activity with a clean slate. It also features a manual reset if you want to clear your step count at any time. Simply hold the reset button for two seconds and your count will return to zero, but the memory will retain your previous numbers. The system reset option clears all memory and data back to zero. The control for this option is housed in the lower left corner on the front of the display with a recessed button so you won&#39;t accidently erase your hard-earned stats.","Though this pedometer is basic and doesn&#39;t have any download options, you gain free access to walking10000.org with the Accusplit. This site is full of helpful tips and support to help you reach the daily 10,000-step goal recommended by the American Heart Association. We like seeing the effort associated with pedometers like the Accusplit to make activity more fun by adding a supportive, social aspect to exercise. This walking pedometer also comes with a wellness guide for tips on food, exercise and small changes to help you reach your goal, whatever the number."]},"id":"d1736fc8-0e9d-46e7-9b27-5688c4736765","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9fd9a73a-3e39-47da-81f2-d03e7a016c52","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Some standout features of the Accusplit AH190M28 include an impressively long battery life that lasts up to 18 months and a five-year warranty.

The long warranty comes in handy if you like high-contact activities, but this device is best for low-impact exercise like walking.
