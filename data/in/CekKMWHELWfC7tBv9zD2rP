You can make a one-time purchase or pay monthly fees to back up your important data, or you can use free versions of the software. In the past, free versions of <a href=\"/money/small-business\">data backup software</a> were extremely basic and performed only a few simple functions. Now you can find applications that offer many of the same tools and features that the expensive programs provide.","Here are six of the best free data backup applications and what makes them worth considering.","<strong>EaseUS Todo Backup Free</strong>","EaseUS Todo Backup Free is one of the most popular free data backup applications available. This software offers a myriad of features and is extremely user-friendly. It provides a full system backup, meaning you can back up your entire operating system. However, you don’t want to perform this type of backup often, so incremental backup is available. Differential backup capabilities, which allow you to back up all your changes since the last full backup, are also available with this free version.","Furthermore, you can schedule your backups, and if you ever need to recover files, you can perform a full system restore or recover individual files or folders. This free application lets you create emergency disks, schedule backups and store your backups in multiple locations. Unfortunately, this free software is only available for Windows operating systems.","<strong>Comodo Backup</strong>","When you use Comodo Backup, you can copy your files to multiple locations such as online storage, an external drive, a network drive and DVD/CD discs. You also have the ability to perform all types of backups including full, incremental and differential. One highlight of this free data backup program is its smart profiling tool. You can categorize files such as music, photos and videos so you only back up the files that you really want to.","If you are unfamiliar with the backup procedure, this software has a step-by-step wizard that will guide you through the entire process. This data backup application is only available for Windows 7 and older operating systems.","<strong>Genie Timeline Free</strong>","This is another extremely simple program that still comes with numerous features. You can back up all of your files, and the application will automatically detect changes between backups. In addition, Genie Timeline Free will back up all of the mobile data stored on your computer.","This software can automatically perform your backups so you don’t have to worry about it. And if your computer is inactive, the software will activate a turbo mode to speed up the backup process, which is a standout feature of this solution.","You can schedule backups and the software copies all your information without any manual effort on your part. This data backup application also lets you monitor your backup health. Apps for your iPhone or iPad are available to continually monitor and ensure all your files can be easily recovered if disaster strikes.  This free data backup software is compatible with Windows 10 and older operating systems. Unfortunately, Mac users cannot use this application.","<strong>Paragon Backup &amp; Recovery Free</strong>","Paragon Backup &amp; Recovery provides all of the basic backup features including full, differential and incremental backups. It also features a backup scheduler so you can schedule regular backups to ensure no new files or data is ever lost. When backing up data with this data backup solution, you can back up to various media including CDs, VDs and Blu-ray discs. When you need to recover your files, you can choose specific files to recover instead of restoring your entire system. Additionally, there are partitioning tools that allow you to create, format and delete partitions. This software is compatible with Windows 10 but unfortunately is not available for Mac users.","<strong>AOMEI Backupper Standard</strong>","AOMEI Backupper Standard is an extremely simple data backup solution that provides basic features including backup capabilities, restoring functions and cloning features. When you back up your files with this application, you can perform full system backups as well as backing up specific files, documents, disks and partitions. You can also complete incremental or differential backups, saving you both storage space and time. And to ensure your backups are kept up to date, you can schedule backups so they happen automatically.","If you need to restore files, you can recover your entire system or individual files, partitions and disks. You also have full cloning abilities, allowing you to clone your entire system, disks or partitions. However, the standard version is much slower than the paid versions of this application. You also cannot enjoy event-triggered scheduled backups. With this feature, backups automatically begin when an event occurs such as an individual logging into their profile, a system shutting down, etc.","<strong>BackUp Maker</strong>","BackUp Maker is designed for Windows 10 and older operating systems. With this data backup solution, you can perform full and partial backups of all your files. You can schedule times for backups to occur and enjoy automatic backup capabilities. You can back up to a variety of media including CDs, DVDs and area networks. You can also back up data into several files, which is also known as disk spanning. There are filtering capabilities so you can filter all your files for easy access, and you can easily restore all your documents using this same application; no other programs are needed. However, when you use the free version of this software instead of the paid version, you do not receive free technical support, which can be a drawback if any questions or issues arise.","There are many options available for backing up your most important data. You can pay for solutions with many features or still enjoy the basic features, often with many extras included and peace of mind that your files are secure, for no costs."]},"id":"db74d807-2bcb-4e07-b46a-6a5cb65f3b5d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10331","url":"/six-best-free-data-backup-software-programs","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-12-08T21:57:48Z","datePublished":"2016-12-08T21:57:48Z","name":"6 Best Free Data Backup Software Programs","synopsis":"Before disaster strikes and all your important files are missing, you want to be prepared.","review":{},"strapline":"Before disaster strikes and all your important files are missing, you want to be prepared.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-12-08T22:00:18Z","id":"CekKMWHELWfC7tBv9zD2rP","meta":{"title":"6 Best Free Data Backup Software Programs","description":"Keep your files secure and money in your bank account with free data backup software.
