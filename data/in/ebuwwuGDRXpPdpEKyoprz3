You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","We don’t discredit the Slice <a href=\"/best-die-cutting-machines\">die cutting</a> system for being a slick made-for-TV product. We discredit it for not having the capabilities that other products have.","There are still features to like about the Slice, to be sure. A lot of users will absolutely love the small size, for instance. The projects most associated with die cutting systems – scrapbook pages, homemade cards, gift boxes and more scrapbook pages – are a lot of fun to do in a group environment. Lugging along your expensive and heavy cutter machine is not going to be much fun, but packing along the Slice will be a joy. It weighs only 2 pounds and offers a built-in handle.","This battery-powered die cutting unit is shown poolside in one of its advertisements. That makes a good point. Some of the other die cutting machines in our lineup were fairly portable – with the ability to work without a computer, carry handles and other features – but the Slice really outdoes them all in that realm. You could be cutting out projects while your kids play in the park or on a camping trip. That level of portability will be a boon to busy crafters.","This die cutting system is quite different in every way from most of the units in our lineup. You place the Slice on top of whatever material you are attempting to cut rather than feeding it through the Slice, like the printer-style die cutting machines. That makes for an easy way to decrease wasted material. Once you get the hang of the Slice you will be adept at placing it in just the right place to allow for the most completed pattern cuts per page possible. Many machines do this automatically, but at least the Slice allows one fit-to-page option, even if not the most sophisticated.","There is very little to customize on the Slice die cutting unit. You can make some minor adjustments to the blade pressure though. Customization will be less important with this particular die cutting system because it only cuts very thin material anyway.","The Slice die cutting system is made to cut cardstock, vinyl and vellum and not much else. It can handle some fabrics, though. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the Slice can draw and emboss. We didn’t really expect it from this compact unit.","The Slice had pretty decent customer service. It took us a while to find the official site – there are a lot of useless ones that look official – but when we did we were pleased. There are well-organized FAQs, accessible support and more. It could use more ideas and inspiration, though. There was not the vast family of dedicated product users we found on other die cutting system sites."]},"id":"2bc8d7e3-4a94-4b65-93c2-d86d9230a8bf","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cc7cd4a0-6e7a-4350-b169-b2c1c5be8d6e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We love the portability of this die cutting product.
