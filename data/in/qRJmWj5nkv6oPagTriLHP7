It also removes clear-water iron and has a self-cleaning sediment filter.","This is a salt <a href=\"/best-water-softeners\">water softener</a>, which means it uses ion exchange to trap hardness-causing minerals in its resin filter media. It treats water with a hardness of up to 70 gpg, which ranks between moderately hard and hard, and removes up to 10 parts per million of clear-water iron as well. It traps up to 22,000 grains of hardness before it requires a regeneration cycle.","The resin media also acts as a filter, trapping sediment particles before they enter your home&#39;s plumbing system. This water softener has a peak flow rate of 12 gpm, but the manufacturer does not provide its service, or continual, flow rate.","Like all salt-using water softeners, this water softener must be connected to a wastewater drain and electrical power for the regeneration cycle. This regeneration cycle purges trapped calcium and magnesium and flushes out accumulated sediment. The used brine solution must be drained when the process is complete. A typical regeneration takes about 17-19 minutes, which is short for one of these cycles, and uses about 2.5 pounds of salt and 14-16 gallons of water.","The softener has an electronic control system that manages this process. The control panel lets you set the time of day and your desired regeneration window so you can avoid running a cycle while your household is using water. You can also start an immediate regeneration cycle. In addition, you can initiate the self-cleaning cycle. The WaterBoss 700 contains a whole house built-in filter that removes dirt and sediment that comes into your water from community or well water supplies. This debris can also come from anything that flakes off your plumbing pipes.","This water softener uses a single-canister design, and the softener media tank is built into the salt reservoir, so it has a fairly small footprint. It holds up to 120 pounds of salt. The <a href=\"/morton-review\">Morton 45,000 Grain</a> has a similar design, but it can hold up to 210 pounds of salt. The WaterBoss comes with the parts and valves required for installation, but you may need additional fittings to finalize plumbing connections. The manufacturer offers a three-year parts warranty, plus a 10-year warranty on the salt and softener media tanks and the valve assemblies.","The WaterBoss 700 22,000 Grain Capacity Water Softener is a compact water softener system that treats very hard water. It has a short regeneration cycle and a self-cleaning sediment filter, and it also removes clear-water iron from your water supply."]},"id":"2bb4bcb1-9ada-4f75-bb53-ac48d73f2952","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63257","url":"/water-boss-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T19:22:13Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T19:22:13Z","name":"WaterBoss 700 22,000 Grain Capacity","synopsis":"The WaterBoss 700 22,000 Grain Capacity Water Softener provides you with soft water by removing calcium and magnesium from your water supply.
