The domed tank bears a sleek contemporary design, and the polyurethane insulation helps limit your energy consumption, so you can continue to heat high volumes of water as needed without racking up a high energy bill.","The Marathon MR85245 Water Heater stands just under 6 feet tall and is 2 feet 4 inches in diameter. It has a 3/4-inch water connection valve, which is compatible with most homes. The 240-volt Marathon unit also includes factory-installed temperature and pressure (T&amp;P) valves and a pipe wrap energy-saving kit. The display panel is near the top of the tank, so you shouldn’t have to worry about little ones playing with your water temperature.","The electric water heater is designed for long periods of high usage, and Marathon backs the water heater with a strong warranty. As long as you live in the home in which you first purchased the heater and don’t move the heater, Marathon will replace the unit if it fails. If you move, the warranty will still last for 15 years from the date of purchase, and the new owner will receive whatever’s left of the time span. The parts themselves are under a six-year warranty, and the model is UL approved.","The 85-gallon water heater should deliver quicker heating compared to a traditional gas water heater. Its price is fairly standard for a unit its size – it is cheaper than most green models, which utilize hybrid technology, but also consume less energy. The design is also unobtrusive and modern.","If you have a family of five or more, or are sharing your place with roommates, a large electric water heater can make all the difference. Marathon’s models are fairly priced, and feature one of the more impressive warranties in the industry."]},"id":"3af910a3-78f5-4cec-95f6-2039705d2c8e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62015","url":"/rheem-marathon-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-30T20:40:38Z","datePublished":"2014-12-30T20:40:38Z","name":"Rheem Marathon 85-Gallon Water Heater","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
