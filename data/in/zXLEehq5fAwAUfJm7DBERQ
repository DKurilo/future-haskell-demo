In our evaluation process, we looked at top-of-the-line action cameras, budget cameras and ones designed specifically for kids to use underwater. Each camera was carefully assessed and thoroughly tested by experienced professionals who take photos by trade (and sometimes even just for fun!). We set up two controlled environments for our tests – one on dry land and one underwater. In our tests, we evaluated photo quality, ease of use, comfort, storage, design and other features. We noted which cameras were the easiest to use as well as the most powerful and capable.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","After first researching waterproof cameras online, we ordered the top devices and tested them ourselves. We performed image quality testing above water for three days and underwater for two.","For our dry land tests, we set up a controlled environment so that each camera had the exact same lighting and positioning. We took photos of our test scene at every ISO available on the camera. Then we compared the images and evaluated them based on accurate color replication, color saturation, sharpness and clarity. The cameras that produced the most accurate and highest quality images were given the highest grades.","The underwater image testing was conducted using a large fish tank. We kept the lighting consistent for each product and captured images of the same underwater scene located at the bottom of the pool. If the camera did not feature an underwater mode, we used the auto settings. We compared the images closely to determine the best ones. The cameras that produced the best underwater images received the highest scores."]},"id":"67827a4b-1515-4372-8877-c2c8e76927c5","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/WMemGt5oBNyDfzieQr8He3.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/electronics/w/450/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS8zL0QvODI1NjczL29yaWdpbmFsL1dhdGVycHJvb2YtQ2FtZXJhcy1UZXN0aW5nLTAwMy5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WMemGt5oBNyDfzieQr8He3.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"WMemGt5oBNyDfzieQr8He3","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WMemGt5oBNyDfzieQr8He3.jpg","alt":""},"id":"b0ded95c-cd62-48de-9bdf-58b3e1a26e78","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Key Features of Waterproof Cameras</strong>","Like most modern digital cameras, waterproof cams have a wide range of available options and features. You can adjust image quality through exposure and shutter speed or even add special effects. Note that some of these cameras can also shoot video. Half of the cameras in our comparison shoot in true HD 1080p, if not 4K, while some only capture lower pixel ratios of 720p and standard definition. In addition, some of the cameras also feature Wi-Fi connectivity and GPS tagging. And though most of these cameras make it easy for experienced photographers to adjust settings, every camera we tested has auto mode and scene modes, if you just want the camera to figure out how to take the photo.","Durability &amp; Design<br/>A rugged design is the key to these cameras. Ensure that the camera you choose is sufficiently waterproof, shockproof, freezeproof and dustproof to keep up with your adventures. It should also be lightweight and slim so it’s easy to pack into a suitcase or backpack. On average, the cameras we tested weigh an average of 8 ounces and are less than 5 inches wide. A few of them are bulky, but when we used them underwater, we felt that they were easier to maneuver than their slimmer counterparts. We liked cameras that had a built-in loop for tying on a wrist strap for extra security during use.","It goes without saying that underwater cameras should be waterproof; the best one in our lineup can handle being submerged in up to 100 feet of water. The cameras have different types of waterproofing. Some you simply place in a watertight exterior case, while others don’t require a case and use rubber seals to protect important parts – like the battery and ports – from leaks up to the recommended water depth.","These cameras should also be decently shockproof – we recommend from a height of at least 5 feet. If you’ll be travelling to more extreme locales, make sure your camera is freezeproof down to at least 14 degrees Fahrenheit and has an IP6X dustproof rating. Keep in mind that, even though these are made for intense usage, none of them are completely immune to any kind of damage or wear and tear.","Also important is whether it has a well-balanced feel for one-handed use. You should also be able to comfortably reach and interact with all of its buttons while holding the camera with only one hand. If you’re sure you’ll always hold the camera with two hands, this won’t matter quite as much, but keep in mind that even with two hands some cameras still feel off-balance.","Resolution<br/>The higher the resolution a camera has, the more information each photo will contain, which translates to a photo with more detail, that looks sharper and clearer. Any camera with a resolution of at least 12MP is good. With that, you’ll generally be able to view details, not grain, and it will look great should you choose to share it online with friends on Facebook. Having a good resolution is especially important when using the camera underwater, where things like sharpness and light are more intensely affected. "]},"id":"3b84ed4a-efad-4c56-b82a-befbde862112","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/yiRFES59bSGrtBKgFuax8m.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/electronics/w/450/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS8zL0MvODI1NjcyL29yaWdpbmFsL1dhdGVycHJvb2YtQ2FtZXJhcy1UZXN0aW5nLTAwMi5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yiRFES59bSGrtBKgFuax8m.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"yiRFES59bSGrtBKgFuax8m","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yiRFES59bSGrtBKgFuax8m.jpg","alt":""},"id":"03909b6a-6be0-4b7f-96bd-f6532e541e80","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Aperture, ISO and Shutter Speed<br/>Together, aperture, ISO and shutter speed form what’s commonly called the exposure triangle because they determine the brightness or darkness of an image. Aperture affects exposure but can also add depth of field to an image. Similar to the pupil of your eye, the aperture is the opening in a camera’s lens through which light passes. You can make it smaller when it’s bright out to limit over-exposure, or increase it in dark scenarios to allow more light in. You can also adjust the aperture to be larger if you want an aesthetically pleasing blur effect in the background of a photo, commonly known as bokeh. Conversely, a smaller aperture means less background blur.","A digital camera’s minimum and maximum ISO can affect how your photos turn out. A lower ISO is less sensitive to light, meaning taking photos of something dark (evening settings, indoors, etc.) generally wouldn’t turn out well. Higher ISOs respond to darker scenes but can come with grain or color distortion known as noise. High-quality digital cameras, especially DSLRs, can handle high ISOs with little to no problem nowadays. Look for a camera with a min/max ISO of about 100-3200. Some cameras can only go up to 1600 manually, but if you’re on auto, they can potentially access 3200 or 6400 if the camera’s algorithm determines that using a higher ISO won’t result in a distorted photo.","Shutter speed is how long the camera’s shutter is open, or how much light the sensor gathers. Speeds are measured in seconds, or rather fractions of seconds. For example, 1/8 means an eighth of a second and 1/250 means one two-hundred-and-fiftieth of a second. A 1/4s speed will let in more light than one that’s 1/8000s. Different speeds are used for different scenarios. As a general rule, fast shutter speeds are great for capturing a clean, clear action shot, and low speeds are ideal for dim environments or to create an intentionally blurry effect.","Digital vs. Optical Zoom<br/>A camera with the ability to zoom in can better capture details and better frame your image. Note that optical zoom is preferable to digital zoom. With optical, the lens physically moves, whereas digitally, you’re actually not zooming at all – rather, you’re cropping the photo. Optical produces a photo at the same resolution as not zooming. Digital reduces the resolution of the photo because it’s cutting into the actual photo. We recommend cameras with 5x optical zoom and at least 4x digital zoom. Quality cameras offer optical zoom and sometimes digital as well, but inexpensive options typically only have digital."]},"id":"860326c4-1e74-44c7-a352-d0ef1a8d62b3","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/KiZUnCufYtZvuwKihmh8AG.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/electronics/w/450/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS8zL0UvODI1Njc0L29yaWdpbmFsL1dhdGVycHJvb2YtQ2FtZXJhcy1UZXN0aW5nLTAwNC5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KiZUnCufYtZvuwKihmh8AG.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"KiZUnCufYtZvuwKihmh8AG","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KiZUnCufYtZvuwKihmh8AG.jpg","alt":""},"id":"49c18284-ee97-45c8-b143-4c11de696990","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Wi-Fi, Bluetooth &amp; GPS<br/>Having Wi-Fi built into your camera allows you to wirelessly transfer your images to a compatible smart device, like your phone or tablet, for further editing or social media sharing. This allows you to get those great underwater action shots then share them instantly with your friends online without destroying your phone.","Nikon users have access to another option to wirelessly tether the camera to their phone – Snapbridge. This technology uses Bluetooth Low Energy to make the connection, rather than Wi-Fi, and which is handy for areas without a reliable Wi-Fi connection. It also stays connected while your camera is off. It also has a mode that automatically transfers all photos you take after converting them to 2-megapixel versions, though you can manually transfer the original file as well.","Cameras with GPS capabilities allow you to geo-tag all of your photos. This marks specifically where in the world you took your photos. This makes it easy for you or a friend to revisit that exact spot again in the future or provides proof that you indeed completed that marathon hike to the summit. Or, if you’re a professional photographer, it’s an automatically-maintained index of locations you can use for repeat photoshoots.","Battery Life<br/>Most of the cameras we reviewed include a rechargeable Li-ion battery. Typically, these allow for about 300 shots on a full charge, depending on usage, settings and shooting environment. The ability to take over 300 shots before a recharge or replacement is optimal. We recommend cameras that have removeable batteries so that you can easily swap them out for a replacement if needed.","<strong>Necessary Accessories</strong>","Once you have your camera, you may think you’re good to go, but don’t be so quick to forget the accessories. After all, with the right accessories, you can get better looking photos and make your photography sessions go a little smoother. Keep in mind that not all the cameras we tested come with accessories, though this differs for each model.","It may not be practical to pack accessories for your underwater camera when you travel across the world. However, if you’ve got extra room in your luggage to spare, they’re worth the space, as they can greatly enhance your photos. If you have a compatible camera, consider taking filters and lenses. They are relatively small and make your photos look polished. We also recommend bringing an extra SD card in case you fill up your first one – that way, you can continue documenting your fun adventures. Along the same lines, you should also bring a backup battery or a battery charger.","Many of the cameras we reviewed float when dropped in water. However, just in case the one you choose doesn’t, we recommend getting a wrist strap to keep you from dropping it in the water and losing it. Also, these cameras have passed rigorous waterproofing tests and are fine as is, but you can opt to buy additional housing for your camera if you’re worried about water seeping in."]},"id":"3be56ba0-e1d4-4c13-af98-07f93fa81d37","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"a2bfd1b0-951a-4327-afc4-d70730fe0bfe","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/nikon-w300-review\">Nikon W300</a>","<a href=\"/fujifilm-finepix-review\">Fujifilm FinePix XP120</a>","<a href=\"/olympus-review\">Olympus Tough TG-5</a>","<a href=\"/fujifilm-finepix-xp130-review\">Fujifilm FinePix XP130</a>","<a href=\"/ricoh-wg-50-review\">Ricoh WG-50</a>","<a href=\"/svp-5500-review\">SVP Aqua 5500</a>","<a href=\"/ettg-review\">ETTG BP88</a>","<a href=\"/ivation-review\">Ivation 20MP</a>","<a href=\"/akaso-review\">AKASO EK7000</a>","<a href=\"/vtech-review\">VTech Kidizoom 180</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"be66298e-9498-4346-b15b-bedfb640d3ab","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_188","url":"/best-waterproof-cameras","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-24T01:05:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-24T01:05:00Z","name":"Best Waterproof Cameras of 2019","synopsis":"We tested each camera's ability to produce dry-land and underwater photos using a controlled test scene photographed at every ISO.","review":{},"strapline":"We tested each camera's ability to produce dry-land and underwater photos using a controlled test scene photographed at every ISO.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-01T19:07:05Z","id":"zXLEehq5fAwAUfJm7DBERQ","meta":{"title":"Best Waterproof Cameras 2019 -
