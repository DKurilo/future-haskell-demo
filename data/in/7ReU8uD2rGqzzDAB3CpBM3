Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer a top product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","We include G Data Total Security among the best <a href=\"/best-premium-security-suites\">internet security software</a> reviews because it performed so well in tests conducted by AV-Test software lab and because its feature list is extensive. The software treads lightly on system resources.","AV-Test installed and ran 25 internet security software suites continuously during March and April of 2014, and G Data was one of them. The host computers were Windows 8.1 (64 bit) machines. All of the products were the most current versions. AV-Test configured them so that each product could update itself whenever it wanted to and query in-cloud services. Two tests measured protection: One of them involved 138 samples of brand new, zero-day malware attacks and the other test involved 20,646 samples of widespread malware. The industry average for the first test was 94 percent effectiveness. The industry average for the second test was 98 percent detection of the widespread malware samples. G Data, however, achieved 100 percent effectiveness in both tests. In the tests that measured influence on host computer speed and impact on the usability of the host computer, G Data equaled industry averages.","The foundation of any premium internet security suite is also the foundation of any basic antivirus product feature list: virus detection, scanning of email for threats, and secure online shopping and banking. G Data is no different in that regard. The features that make it a premium internet security suite go far beyond basics. For example, it has a proprietary firewall for those who might be interested in a third-party firewall that provides a fine level of control over which applications can access the internet. Antispam is another feature that equips G Data to spare you from advertising emails. It also protects against phishing links that would trick you into giving away personal identity data to bad guys. In addition there are parental controls so you can keep your child away from websites that are not age appropriate. You can also control how much time a child spends web surfing and gaming.","This software is missing a few features that the top products have. For example, G Data does not automatically check removable media for threats. There is a password manager, however, which is a great boost to security. It does not suspend communications when you play a game or watch a video. One benefit that is important to everyone, though, is that you can reach G Data support technicians 24/7, which is far better access than some of its competitors."]},"id":"7c748003-259e-486e-83bf-62795295c220","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7768aa39-dc77-45fb-a69e-230463d71ef8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["G Data is among the top 10 internet security brands because of performance and features.
