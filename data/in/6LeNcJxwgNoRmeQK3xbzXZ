It includes many great safety features, including side-impact protection and energy-absorbing foam. Like all other convertible car seats, it is not compatible with any strollers, and the cushions are not machine washable. The Pria will keep your child in a rear-facing position for the recommended two years, but its higher weight minimum makes it a poor choice for newborn babies.","Like all retail convertible car seats, the Pria meets federal crash safety requirements. It is easy to install, thanks to its LATCH connectors, and it offers energy-absorbing foam, side-impact protection and FAA compliance. In its rear-facing position, the car seat secures a child between 9 and 40 pounds. While the 40-pound maximum is impressive, the average child isn&#39;t 9 pounds until 3 to 6 months old. You won&#39;t be able to take your baby home from the hospital in this car seat without buying an extra pad.","In its front-facing position, the Pria can support a child ranging from 22 to 70 pounds. The seat has 12 adjustment settings for the harness, and the groin buckle has three settings. Your child will have room to grow in this seat for several years.","The Pria reclines and has a center-pull harness adjustment. The headrest is adjustable, and it offers plenty of support for your growing child. The best element is the built-in cup holder. Your child can have a drink or a place to put toys or snacks, and you don&#39;t have to worry about it breaking off.","The Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 comes with a one-year warranty. If you need help, you can contact customer support by email and telephone. However, we had trouble getting in touch with the customer service representatives."]},"id":"cd4bfc5a-ab2e-480a-ba0f-20afa907651a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"32c2df08-0830-49cd-bce1-8819b160ca4e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 is a comfortable baby car seat with extra padding.
