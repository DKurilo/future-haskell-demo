Some of the programs even offer free tutorials and online communities, helping you learn everything there is to know about video editing.","<strong>Utilize Both Photos &amp; Videos</strong>","If you want to make a truly unique family video, incorporate photos to make the video more meaningful. It is your video, so you can truly do whatever you want with it. Use many different pictures and videos. You can only enhance a moment, adding depth to a video and creating a unique and entertaining family movie."]},"id":"f647899e-467c-4417-8972-57ef580ef217","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Only Use the Best of the Best</strong>","When you are making a family video, remember that you want it to look as great as possible. That may mean avoiding the temptation of overkill. Don t use every single picture or video that you can find. If you want your video keepsake to look its best, then you should only use the best of what you have. Don t use photos or videos that are almost the same, pictures where not everyone fit in the frame or videos where barely anything happened. Use the most exciting and entertaining content you can find. You want it to make people smile, laugh or maybe even cry. Don t bore people with boring content and leave them thinking about the buffet.","<strong>Effects &amp; Timing Do Wonders to Family Videos</strong>","Remember that time when your loved one was attempting to do something and fell on their behind instead? We all have those funny moments caught on camera. It may not seem possible to make it even funnier, but imagine putting the video in slow motion as your loved one falls down. You may bring tears from laughter. Now, imagine this clip in slow motion but the person falling down over and over again. Manipulate images in hysterical ways such as this with video-editing software. You can also speed up moments where there isn t a lot going on in a video. You can add cool effects like photos fading in or out, videos fading to black at the end, and words or quotes to the family video. Things like that will make your video a creative masterpiece that people will love to watch again and again.","<strong>Music Is Important</strong>","If you make a photo montage, music could play a powerful role in the impact of your video. Funny moments on camera or video are always funnier with a little added music, and the serious moments just pull at the heart-strings even harder. Music is a must no matter what type of video you create.","As long as you possess the patience and the willingness to learn a little about video editing, you can make a great family video that you can watch with your loved ones. It is not a hard thing to do if you have the right software and the drive to learn and become a great editor. Take your time and experiment, and it will be simple for you to create masterpieces in no time at all."]},"id":"f4bb4040-fb5b-4241-b9e5-ccc98cb92f2f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9438","url":"/5-best-tips-for-editing-family-videos","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-23T18:11:23Z","datePublished":"2015-04-23T18:11:23Z","name":"5 Best Tips for Editing Family Videos","synopsis":"Nothing is as special as sharing memories with those you love.
