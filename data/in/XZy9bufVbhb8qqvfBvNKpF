Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This spam blocker has many of the same features and functionalities as our third place product, MailWasher Pro 2010. However, Cloudmark DesktopOne Pro&#39;s small system load, nearly perfect accuracy rate and ease of use are slightly superior to the equivalent features of MailWasher Pro 2010.","Cloudmark DesktopOne Pro uses a different technique to mitigate spam than the spam filter software MailWasher Pro 2010. Cloudmark DesktopOne Pro actually downloads all incoming messages to the email client&#39;s inbox and automatically moves incoming email suspected of being spam to a designated spam folder.","Alternately, the spam filter software MailWasher Pro 2010 leaves all incoming messages on the POP3 mail-server. While still on the server, the spam blocker identifies and recommends suspected spam email for deletion. Both of these approaches are successful and have their advantages. Ultimately, it is up to the user to decide which spam filter software methodology is best suited to their personal needs.","Clearly, Cloudmark DesktopOne has some admirable features and capabilities as a spam blocker solution.","Our <a href=\"/best-spam-filter\">spam filter software</a> Review contains side-by-side objective comparisons of these three and other highly rated spam blocker applications. Please continue reading below for a full discussion of the spam filter software Cloudmark DesktopOne Pro&#39;s full capabilities and features.","Cloudmark Inc. maintains its headquarters in San Francisco, Calif. and has several offices around the world. The company develops messaging security solutions that protect users from spam, phishing, viruses and other malware applications. The spam filter software Cloudmark DesktopOne Pro is one of the company&#39;s main products.","The installation of the spam filter software is straightforward, efficient and fast. On first launch, the spam blocker looks for existing installations of supported email clients. Once found, the spam filter software integrates with the email client by installing an easy-to-navigate toolbar. The spam blocker has a toolbar plug-in available for Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Mozilla Thunderbird and Microsoft Mail.","The spam filter software was easy to remove via the Microsoft Windows Control Panel. On reboot, no remnant of the spam blocker could be loaded into the computer&#39;s operating system."]},"id":"7cd9100a-546f-41aa-bae9-696e68d6477b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"83effcaa-1dd5-4678-b47e-38fa87b073d9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The spam filter software Cloudmark DesktopOne Pro implements a community-based approach to block and filter both spam and bulk email messages. Over a million users drive the spam blocker’s online database. The efforts of these users combine to identify and thwart the senders of spam email. Further, the number of emails that are falsely marked as spam is near zero.","When a member of the online community marks an email as spam, the spam filter software automatically transmits a fingerprint of the message&#39;s attributes to the online database. After multiple users have marked the same fingerprint as spam, the spam filter software blocks the unwanted email for all other users within the community.","On occasion, some users still receive a minimal amount of spam email. The expectation is that they will mark the unwanted message as spam so the spam filter software can report the incident back to the community-based online database. To do so, the user must click the spam filter software&#39;s Block Spam button.","The spam filter software automatically moves all received spam email from the user&#39;s inbox to a designated spam folder.
