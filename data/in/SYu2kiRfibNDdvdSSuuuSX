You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","As far as <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/elgato-stream-deck,review-4513.html\">game capture devices</a> go, the AVerCapture HD is a solid choice. This device has almost all of the recording tools we look for in the best game capture devices. You can record gameplay footage on the PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. You can also use it to record video games on your PC. The only real weak spot for the AVerCapture HD is the lack of editing tools in its software.","To be fair, the bundled software, RECentral, is geared toward live streaming and sharing your content across the internet. The AVerCapture HD and RECentral excel in these categories, giving you a host of options regarding stream quality. However, we were still disappointed that there aren&#39;t many editing tools. For example, you can&#39;t add transitions or commentary to recorded videos.","That said, RECentral is intuitive, feels fluid and is capable of HD game capture. It&#39;s easy to use, and you don&#39;t have to spend much time getting used to it. The included documentation is informative and easy to understand. When you&#39;re recording gameplay, it&#39;s hard to beat the AVerCapture HD. The recordings look great at 1080p, and the video game recorder handles most of the video compression. This means that your PC doesn&#39;t have to work as hard. If you&#39;re recording PC gameplay, you can see higher frame rates while playing.","If you encounter any issues with the AVerCapture HD, then you can browse one of the many support resources available. The knowledgebase is full of useful information, and you can download the manual for device-specific help. There are also video tutorials on how to set up your AVerCapture HD and make the most of its tools and features. The user forums are a great place to learn more and contribute. If none of these resources help you, you can contact the support team via email."]},"id":"40160134-b0a0-40da-9a4a-2b30a5754cc2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c261a467-d02a-4f85-93c9-05c58c495623","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The AVerCapture HD may not be the best game capture device, but it&#39;s pretty close.
