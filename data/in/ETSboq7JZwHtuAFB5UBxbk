They consistently offer products that are a solid step above the norm, and at a reasonable price. The <strong>Polk Audio TSi100</strong> is one of two <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1274-best-bookshelf-speakers.html\">bookshelf speakers</a> in the company’s mid-line TSi series, benefitting from the technology advancements gained by creating the flagship LSi series. Fortunately for the typical consumer, they cost a lot less; indeed the TSi series is only marginally more expensive than the budget conscious R/T/M series of bookshelf speakers.","The Polk Audio TSi100s can be used as front speakers in a home theater system or as surround sound speakers. They’re also well suited to playing stereo music and would represent a good upgrade for many sound systems, easily winning our <strong>TopTenREVIEWS Bronze Award</strong>. The differences between these and the bookshelf speakers that we rated more highly are rather slight and, in many cases, may be little more than an individual listener’s personal preferences."]},"id":"b80467cd-e082-4bef-bfd7-d5f56d4d5110","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"52391521-b3fa-465a-a21a-4e92ddde3363","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The physical size of bookshelf speakers will always be a limiting factor when it comes to deep bass performance, and so is the case with the Polk Audio TSi100. With low-end response extending down to 61Hz, we heard a good but not spectacular bass performance. In one of those little tricks that specifications can play on reviewers, we found the bass delivered by the Klipsch B-20 to be somewhat more satisfying despite being less impressive on paper.","Treble performance was quite outstanding. It was remarkably detailed and clean without ever being fatiguing as some high-frequency drivers can be. The highs merged seamlessly into the mid range, which was full and rich with one rather disappointing, though infrequent, idiosyncrasy. We found occasions when mid-range sound seemed a bit empty and unexciting. Fortunately, most material wasn’t affected by the characteristic of these bookshelf speakers.","The Polk Audio TSi100 is a rather efficient speaker that, with an 89dB sound pressure level, places it at about the midpoint of our top 10. The more efficient a speaker, the more output it produces with a given level of input from the amplifier. Electronic components, specifically amplifiers and tuners, produce better sound when they are able to operate in the comfort zone without being taxed excessively."]},"id":"117a9c76-8dff-4034-85ad-1ec247fe3907","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"96f6e30b-badf-4da4-a886-e638fa955615","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The manufacturer recommends using a tuner or amplifier with input ranging from 20W to 100W. This is a narrower range than those of bookshelf speakers that ranked higher in our survey, but it should be adequate for most users.","These bookshelf speakers are not magnetically shielded so could interfere with a CRT television or monitor if placed close to them. Home theater applications which employ a flat-screen TV won’t be bothered by the lack of shielding. The convenient five-way binding posts are gold plated, which should prevent corrosion and ensure a good cable connection."]},"id":"a12df544-17b4-4cb9-8232-175d822f8fd0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Drivers"},"id":"867d9893-556f-49be-ab78-8bef4f91ba95","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As with most entries in the bookshelf speaker category, each Polk Audio TSi100 includes a low-frequency driver and a high-frequency driver, or tweeter. The 5 1/4-inch low-frequency unit is constructed of polycarbonate making it light but stiff. It responds quickly and precisely for clear sound at any level.","The soft silk dome tweeter produces precise highs but is never shrill or irritating. The crossover, which is set at 2500Hz, routes the majority of musical information to the larger driver while allowing the tweeter to concentrate on just high frequencies."]},"id":"fd705e64-f75b-4ed7-a55a-c2f7a8d9d0e0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"90b14cf7-5d73-4222-af59-324dd413bd51","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Polk Audio TSi100’s cabinet is one of its most outstanding attributes. It’s very sturdy and well braced with 3/4-inch baffles. The structure contributes to the bookshelf speaker’s realistic sound and virtually eliminates distortion. There’s a rear-firing bass-reflex port to enhance bass response, and the speaker includes a keyhole style wall mount. Wall mounting, however, tends to mitigate the benefit of the bass reflex design.","The speaker is available in a black or cherry wood-grain finish that looks more natural than most bookshelf speakers in this price range.
