It is a simple way to get a free word processing application without the worry of downloading viruses. Thereâ€™s nothing to download. You use the software in your browser.","Since nothing is actually on your computer, all your documents are saved in the cloud. This means you have instant access to them from any other computer. As long as you have an internet connection, you can log in to the website to access the program and all of your documents. Users are provided with 15GB of storage space for uploaded files. If you need more storage, you can upgrade to a paid account.","The first thing you&#39;ll notice when opening a document in Google Docs is that it is very user-friendly. The menu options are in the expected places, as are the important editing toolbar buttons. If you are a Word user, the appearance of Google Docs will feel familiar. While navigating the application, we felt as though we were using less powerful version of Word.","The editing features are limited to the basic commands of find and replace, cut, copy, paste, undo and redo. However, for the average user these are the tools that get used most often. You can get add-ons if you need more gadgets, though.","The best feature is the voice-to-text option. You can dictate using the microphone in your computer or device, and Google Docs will type it. You can also review documents using print preview. This is great news for those that have a hard time being able to tell if what they have created is truly what they want to see on paper.","Though the Google Docs word processing software application does not offer the clip art feature that Word does, it does offer some great graphic options. For example, when you choose to insert an image, you are taken to an area where you can upload your own image or you can Google a specific image.","Concerned that the letter you just emailed to Grandma can&#39;t be opened by her word processing application? Google Docs offers the ability to be able to open a document in seven different formats including Word and PDF files.","If you are on a budget and are looking for a word processing software application that can handle an average workload, then Google Docs is an option that you should look into. It works much like Word, and even though some of its tools are limited, it provides plenty of functionality for most home word processing tasks. Plus, because everything is saved to the cloud, you can access your document from any internet connection."]},"id":"fe02b7bb-b2fa-48dc-ba2e-80e2222c3441","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50738","url":"/google-docs-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-09-16T13:55:54Z","datePublished":"2010-09-16T13:55:54Z","name":"Google Docs","synopsis":"With several essential features of the best word processing software and a no-cost price tag, Google Docs is definitely worth your consideration.","review":{"rating":51,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"With several essential features of the best word processing software and a no-cost price tag, Google Docs is definitely worth your consideration.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-09-16T13:55:54Z","id":"E7Uu73sa9hUzB5tZ3g2ArV","meta":{"title":"Google Docs Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"If you are looking for a free program to meet your word processing needs, Google Docs is a good choice.
