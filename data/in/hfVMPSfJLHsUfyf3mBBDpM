You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre provides you with a variety of exceptional features that will enhance your movie viewing experience on your computer. This <a href=\"/best-dvd-player-software\">DVD player software</a> has several standout features that make viewing content on your computer enjoyable and stunning. You can convert 2D videos to 3D, adjust the audio to compensate for a loud viewing environment and navigate through this application&#39;s interface with ease. However, TotalMedia Theatre lacks a few features that similar software has, which is why it ranks lower on our lineup.","This media player software allows you to play both Blu-ray and 3D movies. You can convert 2D videos to 3D and even determine the 3D depth perception for the video content. Additionally, TotalMedia Theatre offers SimHD. This technology allows you to convert standard-definition videos to high definition. This means that no matter what content you desire to view, you can always view it in the highest quality.","The Smart Menu is another standout feature available on this application. This menu gives you full control of your viewing experience, even while video is playing. You can adjust the audio, add subtitles and switch chapters without pausing the show. You can also access information regarding the movie, such as the director, genre and more.","As we mentioned previously, there are a few features this DVD player software lacks. We could not find any karaoke tools that would allow you to play karaoke DVDs and other sing-along soundtracks. Additionally, you cannot customize the user interface.","However, this media player software boasts a user-friendly and simple interface that people of all skill levels can operate. You can access stored, shared and online content from a menu located on the left-hand side of the interface. All of the advanced features are located in menus located along the top of the application. Additionally, changing the settings and even perform advanced tasks such as converting from 2D to 3D or vice versa requires just a click of the mouse. This software requires very little effort to use.","ArcSoft&#39;s TotalMedia Theatre supports a variety of video and audio formats. This makes it possible to view all types of content and provides flexibility in how you utilize this software. You can view WMV, MPEG, AVI and many other video formats. It supports several audio formats too, including WMA, M4A, AAC and AMR.","ArcSoft offers several online resources to guide you if any problems or questions arise. You can find a knowledgebase, FAQs, user forum and more on the ArcSoft website. Additionally, you can reach a support representative directly using email, telephone or live chat support."]},"id":"5b81d450-ba90-4199-af86-dc58ffb1bfe5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"b16c4627-6b25-4af3-be09-fc2b962a1b7c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The real selling point of any DVD player software is the additional features that it provides, and TotalMedia Theatre is fully loaded. The media player includes a unique combination of features and advanced technology that can significantly improve the quality, flexibility and overall experience of watching movies on your computer.","For starters, TotalMedia Theatre 5 has a great user interface. The customizable options are easy to access and easy to understand. The sleek “Magic View” lets you browse your media and online content on an impressive video wall. The DVD player software even makes navigating the actual movie easier by giving you access to a Smart Menu. Similar to the pop-up menu included on Blu-ray movies, Smart Menu lets you set bookmarks, change audio and subtitle options, skip scenes and get more information in real time while the movie is still playing, using the thumbnail preview and discreet floating menu bar.","Another nice playback feature is the time stretch mode. You can dynamically adjust the playback speed to slow down or speed up the movie. This can come in handy if you want to fit in a two-hour movie on a flight that only takes an hour and a half, if you want to slow things down to pick up on hidden subtleties. You can even play the movie in reverse.","Watching movies on your laptop or netbook is convenient, but it can be a drain on your system resources. Luckily, ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre includes a power manager to help you balance battery power and performance without sacrificing quality. The software can even warn you or stop playback when the battery life reaches a certain point.","The DVD player software also includes parental controls so you can restrict rated R and NC-17 movies, or even PG-13 and PG for the kiddies.","The DVD player software supports playback of 3D movies and works with the various 3D formats and 3D TV displays. But one of the most impressive features of TotalMedia Theatre 5 is the capability to play normal 2D movies in 3D. The innovative Sim3D technology can turn 2D into 3D by dynamically adding depth using their proprietary algorithm and technology. It’s not perfect, but it works surprisingly well on some movies. TotalMedia Theatre 5 can convert movies for 3D playback using the 3D methods of left/right, up/down, anaglyph, line interleave and even checkerboard interleave."]},"id":"1c5a9a27-f10b-4d14-ba11-df320ebb18a4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Options &amp; Settings"},"id":"2ec7329a-aed9-4309-a9df-c2354da16910","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Simply playing a DVD with TotalMedia Theatre 5 is ridiculously easy, and taking advantage of additional settings is pretty intuitive as well. Most of the settings can be set automatically for optimum audio and video quality without constantly tweaking the software. The interface is effectively organized and is designed to be simple yet aesthetic.","If you have a smartphone you can download the TM (TotalMedia) remote app and use your phone as the remote (currently available on Android with iPhone support coming soon). Or, the DVD player software integrates well with the Windows 7 Media Center, so you can use your multimedia PC remote."]},"id":"c5577474-c45b-4f11-a8e6-331e46e69443","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"7506fc48-cf72-480f-ae69-1ec04d157be2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The quality of video playback will vary depending on a number of factors, including the actual source file quality, your monitor and graphics card. TotalMedia Theatre is equipped for optimum playback quality that accommodates your individual configuration. The DVD player software is equipped to play DVDs, BDs, online movies and a slew of other video file formats.","TotalMedia Theatre can even make the picture quality better than the original, with ArcSoft’s SimHD video upscaling. For pristine image quality and a sharper picture, the DVD player software improves the film by applying dynamic lighting balance, de-noise and smoothing. SimHD can be used on standard DVD movies for a simulated high-definition experience, but can also dramatically improve the quality of online movies and downloaded content.","To see just how effective the upscaling is and tweak as needed, you can adjust the settings dynamically while the video is playing. Furthermore, you can split the screen (with half of the video upscaled and half not, or a full view of the movie on either side) and compare the results. There are also some preset viewing modes for bright environments, theater-style viewing, or black &amp; white filter."]},"id":"17ca5acd-59c1-4e83-8246-d28ec70c9df7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4e8d6686-05d1-4475-9e9f-faf9e1c08038","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, TotalMedia Theatre is an impressive DVD player application with some compelling features.
