You can still read about it below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product&#39;s information.</em>","The Breadman TR520 is an <a href=\"/best-bread-makers\">automatic bread maker</a> that is fully programmable. This bread machine offers three crust shades and eight functions for bread and dough. The design makes a large, square loaf of up to 2 pounds, though you can make loaves half that size. If you need more capacity to make larger loaves, check out the <a href=\"/breville-review\">Breville BBM800XL</a>. Breadman also provides a two-year warranty on the bread maker, which is twice the normal one-year coverage.","The design of the Breadman TR520 is basic. The outer shell is a square made of white plastic with a view window on top. The control panel on the bread maker is a strange choice; it is gaudy beige with white print, which is a bit hard to read. This bread maker comes with a removable single paddle, which is easy to clean but also means taller, vertical loaves. At just under 14 inches long and wide, it is one of the smallest bread making machines available so it won&#39;t take up much counter space.","The interior of the Breadman TR520 is a nonstick baking pan that has a nice carrying handle for easy removal. You can also remove the lid to wash it. It’s best to wash this bread maker by hand to avoid wear on the components.","The bread machine makes three sizes of bread and offers additional features at an affordable price. Some bread makers allow you to add fruits and nuts at the beginning of baking, which are incorporated by the bread maker when the time is right. Instead of this, the Breadman TR520, it has an add-in signal bell during the kneading that prompts you when extra ingredients can be thrown in. The bread maker also offers a delay timer of up to 13 hours, which is great if you want to wake up or come home to a warm loaf of bread.","The instructions for the machine call for Red Star Active Yeast, and it’s best to use this brand if you’re following the included recipes. The casing also gets quite hot, so keep that in mind if you have small children in your home. The Breadman TR520 also doesn’t include a pause button like other bread machines, which is a disadvantage if you have to add extras mid-cycle or want to push down dough from the corners.","Overall, the Breadman TR520 is a good bread maker for the price. It is not the most attractive bread maker available, but its size offers a small footprint in your kitchen. There are also a multitude of settings that come with more expensive units."]},"id":"e7548f07-615e-4aca-9070-c4d190590fef","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60438","url":"/breadman-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-09-09T21:26:55Z","datePublished":"2014-09-09T21:26:55Z","name":"Breadman TR520","synopsis":"Editor's Note: The Breadman TR520 has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
