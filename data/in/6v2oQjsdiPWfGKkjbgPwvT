You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","SurfSecret Privacy Protector <a href=\"/best-privacy-software\">privacy software</a> is easy to use and includes some unique features, but it needs a more robust arsenal. Privacy Protector helps you locate and permanently remove traces of your internet history and other computer activity. This software is not the free PrivacyProtector, which is actually malware. The most notable features are stealth mode and boss key. Stealth mode puts the program in a transparent state, allowing the software to run undetected. You’ll be the only one who knows it’s running, and can set the software to only be accessed using a custom keyboard shortcut and/or a password. If you’re trying to hide current browsers or IM clients, you can use the Boss Key. This utility lets you set a hotkey to instantly hide your computer activity from any unexpected visitors.","The scope of the software isn’t nearly as comprehensive as it could be. It overlooks some critical areas where sensitive information can be traced. The software is good enough at protecting internet privacy. You can erase your online footprint by consistently removing temporary files, cookies and cache. It supports all the major internet browsers, letting you cover your tracks on them all. Data and files that are effectively removed with this software can be overwritten up to 15 times. This ensures that the information isn’t just out of sight, it’s completely unrecoverable. While the application can remove some Temp files and empty the recycle bin, there are several more tracks left by your use of the computer that remain untouched and available for others to discover. And while the software can erase your trace from some third-party software applications, the compatible list is noticeably smaller than in similar programs.","The interface is straightforward, but could be improved by consolidating some of the many tabs. With the current design, you have quick access to the major components of the software, but there’s little differentiation between the categories. The process of customizing the software and actually performing a clean scan isn’t difficult, but isn’t intuitive for first time users.","There is a decent help file integrated with the software, but online help is sparse. The only way to get specific questions addressed is to fill out an online form and hope they respond."]},"id":"d4737e75-2fca-4332-8d84-c21ee4414a9e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9d8449b6-5aa4-4d30-b851-d2900eec0438","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Privacy Protector is decent privacy solution, but it could certainly use some improvements such as Windows cleaning functions and a dedicated file shredder utility.
