Shining at a comparable 60 watts and 800 lumens, this LED provides enough light to brighten up any room in your home. It is Energy Star certified and does not contain any hazardous materials or mercury. This makes the Cree a safe choice for homeowners. The best LED bulbs are long lasting, and the Cree 9.5-Watt LED has a lifespan of up to 22.8 years, which is on the high end for LEDs. This can save you a pretty penny as you won&#39;t have to buy new bulbs every year.","The best advantage to replacing your current light bulbs is the amount of money and energy you can save. This 60-watt LED bulb only costs an average of $1.14 per year, if you use it for about three hours a day, seven days a week, which is typical for the industry. This is an incredible savings compared to the hundreds of dollars it costs to use an incandescent bulb over the course of a year. Because it uses such little power, you won&#39;t feel guilty if you accidentally leave it on overnight. Cree also offers this LED light bulb in 40 watts and 100 watts if you need less or more light in a room."]},"id":"8abd5de4-7400-4f6c-a5bf-9e5e8ad4f9fe","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Bulb Characteristics"},"id":"f4e4e1fb-ec08-45ff-88de-5de466c436d7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The first LED light bulbs ever developed had bulky, unusual shapes, looking like a sci-fi movie prop.
