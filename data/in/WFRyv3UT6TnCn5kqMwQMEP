As digital resolution improves, the file size of photos increases, so you can really benefit from software that can quickly process large files, in large batches, and that also incorporates granular editing tools for fixing small details. While professional photographers strive to take perfectly composed shots with flawless exposure levels, most photos could still use subtle touch-ups. Serious photographers also need the file organization and conversion tools found in professional editing software.","While <a href=\"/software/multimedia/best-professional-photo-editing-software/photoshop-review/\">Adobe Photoshop</a> has been a benchmark for professional photographers and digital artists, there are many other substantive competitors to consider. Two notable editing programs are <a href=\"/software/multimedia/best-professional-photo-editing-software/paintshop-review/\">Corel s PaintShop Pro X7</a> and <a href=\"/software/multimedia/best-professional-photo-editing-software/opticspro-review/\">DxO Optics Pro</a>.","<strong>Professional Photo Editing Software: What to Look For</strong>","The best choice for photography software will depend on your preferences. Many people like using one program for organizing and another for editing. Some programs are often used in tandem, such as Photoshop and Lightroom. Some programs, like Portrait Professional, can be used alone or as plugins for Photoshop. Features to look for when you choose professional editing software include organization and importing tools, the ability to edit batches and individual photos, the ability to customize your workflow and the options for publishing and output.","<strong>Organizational Tools</strong><br/>If you shoot a high volume of photos, organizational tools are critical. Some sports photographers will shoot thousands of photos in bursts to publish only a handful from a single event. Wedding photographers also take hundreds of shots to document one significant event. For these and many other instances, the most important part of post processing involves the ability to quickly sort through large batches of photos rather than make significant changes to individual photos.","<strong>Actions and Customization</strong><br/>Many photographers develop their own style of post processing. Once you ve established a unique style and pattern of processing, much of what you do can be automated through recordable actions or presets. Many photographers display primarily black and white, or photos that emulate film processing, or something unique to their own brand. If you find yourself using the same actions or techniques of your own, you&#39;ll want photo editing software that can automate those actions to save you hours of extra work.","<strong>Publishing and Output</strong><br/>If you are working with high numbers of photos or if you frequently publish online to a blog, website or photo hosting service, it helps to have export options that are more sophisticated than simple saving features. Some photo editing software can include sharpening, resizing, adding color profiles and making other finishing touches to batches of photos. Likewise, if the majority of your work goes online for sale, blogging or other methods of publishing, some professional photo editing software can do this automatically.","<strong>Learning Curve</strong><br/>The more robust editing suites are some of the most complex consumer programs to learn. If you re new to Photoshop or PaintShop, it may be worth investing in a formal class to get traction on the basic features. There are also countless YouTube channels, blogs and more formal online classes to help you understand the features of these programs.","A simpler option may be finding a program you can pick up quickly. Some programs will walk you through a workflow step-by-step, and if you don&#39;t need to work through multiple layers of edits, there are plenty of simpler options that streamline the editing process.","Professional photo editors play an essential part in a photographer s workflow. Whether you spend hours on individual photographs or quickly make minor edits to batches of photographs, you can find photo software that will work for your needs."]},"id":"92f7b6bd-e7e0-43e4-ae2a-10a59d52fa73","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"3ba0edd5-9ca4-4a33-99e6-14acfef0f3d6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7873599-10385742-1426256660000\">ACDSee</a>","<a href=\"http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-7873599-10274094-1463178368000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.paintshoppro.com%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fpaintshop-pro%2Fstandard%2F&cjsku=ESDPSPX8ML\">Corel PaintShop</a>","<a href=\"http://www.cyberlink.com/stat/edms/affiliate/Purch_Top_ten_review/PHD.jsp \">CyberLink PhotoDirector</a>","<a href=\"https://shop.dxo.com/us/photo-software/dxo-opticspro\">DxO OpticsPro</a>","<a href=\"http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1132136-REG/adobe_65237578_photoshop_lightroom_6_download.html/BI/8236/KBID/8940/kw/ADPSL6/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xADPSL6\">Lightroom</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B057U6/?&tag=ttr_professional-photo-editing-software-20 &ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1766[art|NA[pid|66173[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Nikon Capture NX2</a>","<a href=\"https://creative.adobe.com/plans?single_app=photoshop?promoid=KRQMD\">Photoshop</a>","<a href=\"http://www.portraitprofessional.com/photo_editing_software/\">PortraitPro</a>","<a href=\"http://track.webgains.com/click.html?wgcampaignid=75640&wgprogramid=7235&wgtarget=http://www.serif.com/photoplus/\">Serif PhotoPlus</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"7f4fc5bc-48f7-4e7e-89c5-289d89eacb73","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1766","url":"/best-professional-photo-editing-software","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-04-08T22:24:35Z","datePublished":"2017-04-20T17:03:53Z","name":"Professional Photo Editing Software Review","synopsis":"Professional photo editing software is an essential part of your photography.
