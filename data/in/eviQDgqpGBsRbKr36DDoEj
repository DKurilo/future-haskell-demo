It also works with a wider variety of smart home devices than most other security systems. When you sign up for this company's 24/7 monitoring services, you get two options for installation: professional or self. If you choose to self-install your system, Brinks sends instructions and pre-programmed equipment to your home. Although professional installation costs extra, a technician does all the work for you and shows you how the system works. Professional installation includes a lifetime warranty, but self-installers can pay $49 for the same benefit. Uniquely, Brinks also sells optional monitoring services for Nest Secure, a DIY system, making it the only provider we reviewed with three system options: self, professional and DIY. As is typical of most security systems, the contract lasts three years. However, the early-termination policy is higher than average, requiring 80 percent payoff of your account balance. If you want to cancel without fees, you have 30 days after your contract begins to return equipment. The most basic of the company's two monitoring plans, Brinks Home Complete, costs $29 a month, which is lower than the industry average of $37.

The system has two affordable plans that cost $14.99 and $24.99 a month respectively. The cheaper plan only offers monitoring while the other plan adds remote access via a mobile app and an online dashboard. SimpliSafe has higher starting costs than most home security providers because you pay for everything upfront instead of paying off equipment throughout a long contract. The starter kit we reviewed, The Essentials, costs about $260. Even with the higher starting costs, the affordable, no-contract monitoring helps even out the costs and makes this one of the least expensive systems available. If you pay for the required equipment, SimpliSafe is great for most basic home security functions, such as intruder detection through motion sensors, entry sensors, a security camera and other sensors. You can also get sensors that detect hazards such as flooding, smoke and carbon monoxide. You install the equipment yourself, which also cuts down on costs. The equipment has a three-year warranty. Unfortunately, SimpliSafe only supports a handful a smart home devices such as Amazon Echo, Nest Learning Thermostat and August Smart Lock.

We also rejected companies that don&#39;t share key contract terms and conditions online in some form before you sign. This narrowed our initial 23 companies to 10 that fit these requirements. You deserve access to vital contract terms before calling a salesperson. Lastly, we eliminated smaller regional companies that only offer service in a few states or cities.","Here are a few security providers that ultimately didn&#39;t meet our selection requirements: <a href=\"http://www.guardianprotection.com/\">Guardian Protection Services</a> and <a href=\"https://www.northstarhome.com/\">Northstar Alarm Services</a> both have almost no pricing and contract terms available online without a sales call, while <a href=\"https://www.bayalarm.com/\">Bay Alarm</a> only offers service in California, Washington and Arizona. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of security providers in the U.S., so vetting and rejecting potential candidates for review is an ongoing process each time we update our comparison.","While researching this topic, we requested information from two associations in the security industry. First, we contacted the <a href=\"https://www.securityindustry.org/\">Security Industry Association</a> (SIA), which connected us with a board member, Kirk MacDowell, president of MacGuard Security Advisors Inc. He suggests getting a security system sooner rather than later, &#34;Sadly, many consumers wait until a burglary occurs before they invest in a system. And burglars don’t discriminate.&#34;","We also got information from Jamie Vos, vice president of the <a href=\"http://esaweb.org/\">Electronic Security Association</a> (ESA), who told us, &#34;You need to go into the decision-making process with your eyes wide open. Select the provider that understands your security needs, can act as your advocate and point out security needs you may not have considered or explain why a certain technology you want may not be the best option for you.&#34;","<strong>How We Tested Home Security Systems</strong>","We define the best home security systems as those with good prices and fair contracts. We examined company websites and sought clarification from the services if we couldn&#39;t find something.","To evaluate pricing, we looked at the base rate, with smartphone controls, for comparable monitoring plans from each security company.

We also assessed which customer support channels a company offers and whether its support hours extend beyond the business day, letting you get assistance on your time.","<strong>How Much Does a Home Security System Cost?</strong>","Monthly monitoring fees for a home security system range from $21 to $50, with contracts lasting three years on average. You can expect to spend an average of $120 in starting costs, which covers equipment, installation and activation fees. Unless your home matches a company&#39;s starter packages, you will pay more than this.","With few exceptions, this is a quote-based industry, which means equipment prices vary from home to home.

Other taxes and fees also affect your home security system costs each month. If the company spreads equipment costs throughout your contract, the monthly fee might be higher as well.","Homeowners Insurance Discounts","There&#39;s a silver lining to paying for an alarm system: It can lower your <a href=\"/best-homeowners-insurance\">home insurance</a> costs. For example, most insurers offer a discount of at least 5 percent for having a security system in your home. Insurance companies know that the majority of burglars aren’t willing to risk targeting a home with a security system, making it less likely they’ll have to pay out on insurance claims.","<br/>If you meet certain requirements, such as having security cameras or smoke detectors, you can get a bigger discount, up to 20 percent, from some insurers. Although insurance discounts don’t entirely offset the costs of equipment and monitoring fees, they can make security systems more affordable for people with a limited budget. Check with your homeowners insurance provider to see what kinds of discounts you can get for having a security system.","<strong>What to Expect From a Security System</strong>","Contracts Explain Fees &amp; Cancellation Policies<br/>Contract length ultimately affects your total costs and cancellation fees. Most security alarm systems have one- to three-year contracts, though five-year contracts also exist. The best contracts don&#39;t have a minimum term, instead offering month-to-month services. Auto-renewals are standard, and monthly renewals are better than yearly ones.","Early-cancellation policies often require you to pay some or all of the balance remaining on your account. However, some of these policies are fairer than others. An ideal cancellation policy has no fees, but one that requires you to pay 80 percent or less of what you owe is better than one that requires 100 percent payoff.","Equipment return policies let you return your system and avoid most cancellation fees. Some contracts only give three days after installation for this. Most allow two to four weeks, and a few have longer return policies.","Customer Service<br/>Customer service is similar to cell phone signal strength, where more bars means a better signal. In customer service, more support channels and useful operating hours lead to a better customer experience.","We favor companies that provide support over social media. This is a reliable channel, since a public post or private message on a company’s Facebook or Twitter page often gets a quick response. Other effective channels include live chat and phone support, though phone support is less ideal. Email is the slowest support channel. We also favor companies with 24/7 customer support over those with limited business hours.","Psychological Barriers, Not Physical Ones<br/>Unfortunately, once someone decides to break into your home, a burglar alarm can&#39;t physically stop them. However, it&#39;s a strong psychological deterrent that relies on the intruder&#39;s fear of getting caught.","As a result, a security system&#39;s yard signs and window decals can make would-be burglars reconsider targeting your home, and the blaring alarm could scare them away before they cause more trouble.","24/7 Home Security Monitoring<br/>Alarm systems use certified monitoring stations to watch your home 24/7. When an alarm goes off, the monitoring station contacts you to see if everything&#39;s OK and sends help if needed or if there&#39;s no reply.","Security Devices Included<br/>Three devices are the basis of every security system: a control panel, entry sensors for doors and windows, and motion detectors. Some companies include other equipment as an incentive, but it&#39;s not always free.","Wireless Equipment<br/>Modern systems use battery-operated sensors that wirelessly connect to a control panel. The control panel requires a power cable most of the time but usually has a battery backup.","Cellular Monitoring Connection<br/>Most systems have a cellular link to the monitoring station, which we consider the best option for 24/7 security, even during power outages. Some providers can also use internet or landline connections.","Smartphone Apps<br/>You can arm, disarm and control modern security systems with a smartphone, though some basic plans don&#39;t support it. More expensive plans usually offer features like smart home control and security camera viewing.","Installation<br/>Depending on the security company you choose, you will have at least one of three installation options: professional, self-installed and DIY."]},"id":"d52e4415-aac5-48b3-9041-bd4525af4cfa","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["<em>Professional</em> – The security provider sends an installer to your home to consult with you on what equipment you need. They may try to sell you additional equipment on site, but you don’t have to commit to equipment you don’t want.

You can expect professional installation from small, local companies as well as Brinks Home Security, ADT, Vivint, Xfinity, AT&amp;T Digital Life and Cox Homelife.","<em>Self-Installed</em> – The company ships a package to your home with the equipment you selected.

This is used to pay for shipping and service calls. Some providers charge a flat fee for each service call instead of requiring a monthly fee.","Most warranties require you put the system into test mode on a monthly basis to look for faulty sensors or dead batteries. Warranties don&#39;t cover dead batteries, so expect to change them every few years. Faulty devices under warranty are usually replaced for free.","Alarm Permits<br/>A permit means you agree to pay for excessive false alarms that divert limited police resources and require your system to meet certain local standards. Vos said, &#34;Different jurisdictions have their own unique permitting requirements. You should check with your local law enforcement to determine if a permit is needed and what the requirements are for that permit.&#34;","If you&#39;re unsure what you can do regarding your permit, ask if the security company provides assistance with permits or if you must do this on your own.","Credit Checks<br/>It’s common practice for security companies to check your credit score before allowing you to sign a long-term contract. As with any other company that’s looking at your credit, this is to see if you’re able to make the required monthly payments for monitoring and any financed equipment. Security providers focus on your credit score, rather than your credit history, and usually request the score from only one credit bureau. This type of credit check is known as a soft inquiry and shouldn’t affect your score. You should qualify if your credit score is above 600, which most lenders consider good credit.","If you have poor credit, you may still qualify for a security system. No-contract options are another way to get security without good credit. Systems such as <a href=\"/nest-secure-review\">Nest Secure</a>, SimpliSafe and <a href=\"/scout-review\">Scout Alarm</a> fall under this category, though you will have to pay for all of your equipment upfront. You’ll still pay for monthly monitoring, but you won’t have a long-term contract or its accompanying credit check.","<strong>Security Systems: Getting the Basics</strong>","Contacting the sales team or buying equipment should be one of the last steps in getting a home security system.

If you have home automation devices as part of your security system, this makes your home seem more convenient, especially if the buyer wants a smart home.","That said, if you’re using your security system to help sell your home, you can’t take it with you when you move.

Check with your realtor or appraiser to see how much value the security system adds to your home and if that’s enough to finance a new system after you move.","One thing to think about, though, is that many professionally-installed systems, like ADT, offer a moving benefit that installs a new system in your new home for a discount or sometimes for free. You may need to meet specific requirements to qualify for a moving benefit, and using a moving benefit almost always results in a full renewal of your long-term contract. The buyer of your old home probably won’t be able to take over your original monitoring contract either and will likely need to sign one of their own, though they can usually get lower monitoring fees since there’s no installation or equipment to pay for.","<strong>What Are the Best DIY Home Security Systems?</strong><br/>","Our current top picks for DIY security systems are Scout Alarm, <a href=\"/abode-review\">abode</a> and Nest Secure.

The system launches into action by dispatching the drone whenever a sensor detects people, animals or cars approaching your property; this method is a lot more realistic than having a drone over your home 24/7. If this product ever makes its way to homes, it will be more expensive than a traditional security system, but it will change the way we think about home security."]},"id":"7a69a3d5-d6b1-4afb-b4a5-a6b705f9623a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_326","url":"/best-home-security-systems","authors":[{"email":"jcarlsen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-04-10T12:44:00Z","datePublished":"2019-04-10T12:44:00Z","name":"Best Home Security Systems of 2019","synopsis":"We evaluated 10 home security companies and ranked them from best to worst based on their costs, policies and customer service.","review":{},"strapline":"We evaluated 10 home security companies and ranked them from best to worst based on their costs, policies and customer service.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-04-17T16:01:57Z","id":"eviQDgqpGBsRbKr36DDoEj","meta":{"title":"Best Home Security Systems of 2019 | ADT, Brinks, Vivint, Frontpoint and more","description":"We evaluated 10 home security companies and ranked them from best to worst based on their costs, policies and customer service."},"products":[{"slug":"frontpoint","url":"/product/frontpoint","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","name":"Frontpoint","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","id":"5n2Q2sULsh8NtNUnpkqdWW","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"brinks-home-security","url":"/product/brinks-home-security","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","name":"Brinks Home Security","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","id":"6CCE7BMBxpMXYGcnftcZaj","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"adt","url":"/product/adt","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","name":"ADT","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","id":"GCX88BiaEWFSoyXkm82cf3","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"simplisafe","url":"/product/simplisafe","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","name":"SimpliSafe","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","id":"oUHXpAKEKstVXfyixZQQzW","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"vivint","url":"/product/vivint","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","name":"Vivint","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","id":"uf2wwS5Ybj3vXSkQpyc6ck","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"link-interactive","url":"/product/link-interactive","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","name":"Link Interactive","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","id":"i6qEDtXZQdPH2jXSptvgtD","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/dxxq6HiwSyU8TmX3cHaFX7.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Home-Security-Monitoring_002.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/K/0/788688/original/Hero-Home-Security-Monitoring_002.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","id":"dxxq6HiwSyU8TmX3cHaFX7","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxxq6HiwSyU8TmX3cHaFX7.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Home Security Systems of 2019","description":"We evaluated 10 home security companies and ranked them from best to worst based on their costs, policies and customer service."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/dxxq6HiwSyU8TmX3cHaFX7.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Home-Security-Monitoring_002.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/K/0/788688/original/Hero-Home-Security-Monitoring_002.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","id":"dxxq6HiwSyU8TmX3cHaFX7","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxxq6HiwSyU8TmX3cHaFX7.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Home Security Systems of 2019","description":"We evaluated 10 home security companies and ranked them from best to worst based on their costs, policies and customer service."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"security","url":"/home-and-garden/security","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","name":"Security","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:05:04Z","id":"S72GevTPy4i8qUbbeJywuG","dateImported":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
