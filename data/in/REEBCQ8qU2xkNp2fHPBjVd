You can switch between a wide beam that illuminates an area up to 20 meters in front of you at 120 lumens or a 90-lumen spot beam that stretches out for up to 90 meters to give you a focused look at areas of terrain far ahead of you. This <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-running-headlamps\">running headlight</a> also has a mode for turning on both the flood light and spotlight at the same time. A separate red LED gives you the option of reading maps and notes without affecting your night vision. You can also set this headlamp to strobe to make you more visible.","This running headlight uses three AAA batteries, which is convenient when it comes to finding replacement batteries. However, it&#39;s less convenient than being able to recharge the battery directly. At maximum power, the batteries last about 48 hours, and when the headlamp is in economy mode, you can get about 110 hours out of it.","The comfortable headband is adjustable, so it fits on most heads, and it is designed to resist slipping or jostling. However, at 2.7 ounces, it is slightly heavier than some models, which could become noticeable after long hours of wear. The lamp can be tilted to ensure that what you want to see is hit by the beam. A locking mechanism prevents you from accidentally turning the running headlamp on or off.","The Yalumi Spark Pro has a water resistance rating of IPX-4, so it is reliable in damp conditions, but this running headlight won&#39;t withstand complete submersion in water. The button on top is easy to press, even when you are wearing gloves. This model does require you to cycle through each mode before you can turn it off, so you can&#39;t just quickly shut it down with one click.","As an economical, functional running headlight, the Yalumi Spark Pro is a good option. While it isn&#39;t fully customization, this headlamp offers enough adjustability to add safety to your night running sessions."]},"id":"392e572e-d6c4-4b5a-848b-2ee40218ed0b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62539","url":"/yalumi-spark-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-03T20:44:08Z","datePublished":"2015-02-03T20:44:08Z","name":"Yalumi Spark Professional","synopsis":"The Yalumi Spark Pro is an LED headlamp that lets you choose between wide and focused beams, so you can tailor light output to your specific needs.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Yalumi Spark Pro is an LED headlamp that lets you choose between wide and focused beams, so you can tailor light output to your specific needs.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-03T20:44:08Z","id":"REEBCQ8qU2xkNp2fHPBjVd","meta":{"title":"Yalumi Spark Professional Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Yalumi Spark Pro is an economical running headlight that delivers plenty of beam options at an affordable price.
