You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","After using Design Workshop Classic, we got the impression that this <a href=\"/best-kitchen-design-software\">kitchen design software</a> is designed for professionals and those with AutoCAD experience more than the average home user. Its interface is a bit complicated, and while it&#39;s a powerful application, smaller home-oriented details are missing.","You can create some highly realistic 3D designs, but be prepared to spend some time learning the ins and outs of the software, particularly if you&#39;re not already familiar with computer-aided drafting. When viewing your plans in 3D, you can set the camera view angles and do a three-dimensional walkthrough.","When it comes to doing things like custom designing your cabinets and molding, this kitchen design software can fall a bit short when compared to its peers, particularly in terms of ease of use. There isn&#39;t even a designer wizard for cabinets, doors or windows, which most other applications we reviewed offer in some capacity. You also can&#39;t run a project cost estimator, which is a vital tool to inexperienced consumers and professional designers alike.","The object libraries that come with this software are fairly basic, though there are options for lighting, furniture, appliances, cabinets, windows and various floor materials. If you shell out some extra money for KitchenPAK or DesignTextures, however, you can build up a fairly impressive arsenal of objects.","We found that, overall, this is a highly powerful and relatively complicated piece of software. Some background in AutoCAD design would undoubtedly be helpful if you&#39;re considering this application. If you don&#39;t have such a background, be prepared to spend a great deal of time learning to use the software before you delve into the actual kitchen design.","Fortunately, there are a couple of video tutorials online to help with this. There are also some editable room templates and floor plans that come with the software to give you a little extra help in creating your kitchen layout. With such a complicated piece of kitchen design software, these templates could prove themselves fairly invaluable.","The website has a variety of help and support options, but they&#39;re rather poorly organized. With some searching, we were able to find a contact email form, some FAQs and a downloadable user manual. There are also some troubleshooting guides and a list of tips and tricks for using the software. The user message board forum is available, but it looks fairly old and it might not have been updated in some time.","A note on compatibility issues, as well. The website indicates that you can install it on newer Windows operating systems, although it notes that you have to do a special installation if you have Windows Vista. It doesn&#39;t make any mention of Windows 7, and while it is compatible with Mac systems, it only works on Mac Classic and PPC-based Mac OSX machines; it isn&#39;t compatible with the newer Intel-based Macs."]},"id":"bd209de0-ccfb-484c-b4ca-f876cc8e95c2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3f3f8f01-4de6-412a-87cb-4bd1bdfc07e8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you have professional experience with AutoCAD software, <strong>Design Workshop Classic</strong> could be a decent, if slightly older, option for you.
