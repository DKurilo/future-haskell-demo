The company doesn’t sell packages of preselected equipment like many home security monitoring businesses do. Instead, it customizes your system to suit your house and needs with equipment recommendations from a local dealer.","Since it works only with certified dealers in its network, you can be certain that whichever one you choose is a trained professional. The dealers, in turn, can call upon a network of 50 to 100 hardware partners. With ELAN, you get a substantial choice of equipment in the event you favor a particular brand. All equipment is covered by a two-year warranty, which is shorter than average, but not out of the ordinary in the home control system industry.","ELAN’s g!Mobile app works with your smartphone or tablet to let you do such things as set the temperature in your home, check that the doors are safely locked, and let children or repair people into the house, as well as set the mood for entertaining by controlling lights, music and more. The app is also outfitted with a multi-purpose intercom that permits audio and video communication between your different residences. You can make sure your children are safe, keep watch over a pet, see who is at the front door, ensure the house temperature is at an energy-saving level and much more with this versatile tool. This handy app also comes with a do-not-disturb mode for when you need to focus on things other than domestic matters. ELAN’s home control equipment is quite advanced, allowing you to operate the system with voice controls like our top pick, <a href=\"/crestron-review\">Crestron</a>.","You can also reduce your utility bills and make your home greener with features that raise and lower shades, open or close blinds, adjust room temperature, turns off the swimming pool heater, and more. You can do this yourself with a tap of the finger on your smartphone or tablet, or you can set ELAN’s smart system to perform tasks automatically. ELAN also provides you with a history of your home’s energy use.","The company’s website has a gallery of homes, backyard amphitheaters, home entertainment areas and other buildings it has equipped with an impressive array of security and lifestyle equipment. You can peruse the gallery to get ideas for devices and services you might want for your house. The website also features a brochure that clearly describes and explains everything you can get from an ELAN system, including the ability to adjust the pool temperature and set a schedule for your automatic lawn sprinklers."]},"id":"87c2522d-3cc9-47a2-ac12-ed6d0b55e1f0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9024a7e2-04fa-40ea-9bcc-8c86dbaf8413","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["ELAN offers customized home automation systems that help keep your house secure and enhance its comfort and appeal You, your family and guests can make use of the equipment from ELAN’s certified dealers to lower your utility bills, turn on your entertainment system, keep your home secure and more."]},"id":"5b9f0d71-36b5-4a96-aecd-577447b60c7b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68177","url":"/elan-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-04T21:19:24Z","datePublished":"2016-08-04T21:19:24Z","name":"Elan g!","synopsis":"ELAN home automation systems give homeowners the convenience of controlling their homes using remote controls, touchscreen displays, mobile apps and more.","review":{"rating":92,"verdict":"ELAN provides a generous selection of equipment along with customized and professional installation to make your home inviting and easy to manage.","pros":["Your home automation system is customized, rather than a package of preselected equipment."],"cons":["The system&#039;s two-year warranty is shorter than average."]},"strapline":"ELAN home automation systems give homeowners the convenience of controlling their homes using remote controls, touchscreen displays, mobile apps and more.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-08-04T21:19:24Z","id":"8s2YqrEtz2cfTdYstSqRQd","meta":{"title":"Elan g!
