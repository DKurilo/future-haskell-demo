Sometimes trimmers just don’t get every hair, requiring you to pass over the same spot multiple times to get hair the same desired length. The quality of the Oster Classic 76 becomes readily apparent through its powerful blades that cut through thick and wet hair alike without pulling or slowing.","The Oster Classic 76 is designed for easy maintenance and customization of cutting. The blades easily remove and fit back into place with minimal issue. You can pick between the two included blades that cut down to 0.5 and 2.4 millimeters respectively, or simply use the attachment guide combs for longer cut lengths. This hair trimmer is so easy to use that most operators can cut their own hair.","The design of hair shears often speaks to the quality of a device, and the Oster Classic 76 is no different. These electric hair clippers are comfortable to hold, and the motor generates minimal vibrations, reducing hand fatigue. The body of the clipper is solidly built, with a thick red casing made of an unbreakable valox resin. The power cord is heavy duty to avoid accidental cutting, but still bendable for easy reaching. Best of all, the power button is located on the back and away from your hand where you might accidentally turn it off mid-cut.","The Oster Classic 76 stands out as a reliable and durable set of hair trimmers. It receives very few consumer complaints beyond the occasional manufacturer defect. While it may not be the lowest priced model available, the power and effectiveness of its blades in cutting hair in fewer passes more than makes up for it."]},"id":"19338f18-3b2b-4201-83df-33055a0fee0a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58163","url":"/oster-classic-clippers-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-14T20:28:08Z","datePublished":"2013-11-14T20:28:08Z","name":"Oster Classic 76","synopsis":"Editor's note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
