Avanti has it down to a science when it comes to manufacturing compact washers that are small in a big way.","The Avanti W757 is one of the smallest portable washers in our lineup. It weighs in at a lithe 63 pounds, is only 34 inches tall and measures just less than 21 inches wide. Despite its small size, this washer still holds 1.65 cubic feet of laundry. That&#39;s just half a cubic foot less than our number one portable washer fits."]},"id":"1a2a605b-28fc-4a4c-8680-cbae3071d602","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design &amp; Portability"},"id":"f670d560-921c-4dfa-b6b1-b6b96d2134b7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Like the majority of the portable washing machines in our lineup, the Avanti W757 has an automatic system for water levels. Contrasting from the rest, however, this washer has the most selections for water levels: 10 of them. You can select low or high, or any of the 10 increments in between.","The bi-fold lid adds to the convenient compactness of this portable washer. If you&#39;ve wedged your machine into a narrow corner of a crowded apartment, even a seemingly inconsequential thing like a lid that doesn&#39;t have to extend fully can greatly assist your space situation. The lid can be pushed back to quickly add an extra item to the wash, or you can remove it completely to load a new cycle. It is also transparent, so you can watch to make sure your clothes are getting clean in the pulsating drum. If you have little ones, Avanti has made precautions to greatly reduce the odds of a portable washer-related accident. When you activate the childproof setting, an alarm sounds if anyone opens the lid during any cycle. If the lid isn&#39;t closed again in 10 seconds, any water in the washer will automatically drain and the cycle will terminate.","The lack of softener and bleach dispensers in this washer is a little frustrating, as those features seem to be standard for most modern washing machines. This certainly isn&#39;t a catastrophic omission. You can simply add softener and bleach manually at the appropriate point in a wash cycle."]},"id":"b85935dc-f089-44ae-86c9-075489e08ce1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Cycles &amp; Wash Settings"},"id":"09bf5a15-870c-4712-96c8-2100ba779e4a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Avanti W757 is the most energy-efficient portable washing machine in our lineup, though not by a long shot.
