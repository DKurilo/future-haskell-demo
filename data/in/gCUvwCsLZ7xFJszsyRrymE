While this <a href=\"/best-cordless-drills\">cordless drill</a> excels in design, speed and power, the battery charge time isn’t great, and the warranty is just average. Overall, though, it’s a versatile tool you can use for smaller projects on a job site or around the house.","This drill can reach speeds up to 2,000 RPM, which is as fast as the best cordless drills we reviewed. You can switch between two speed settings, depending on your project – the high speed is for drilling holes and the low setting is best for driving screws. It also has 18 clutch settings you can adjust to when the tool is in screwdriver mode; these settings keep you from  damaging the material you’re working on or snapping off a fastener head. The more clutch settings you have the more control you have, and other models we reviewed, such as the <a href=\"/milwaukee-cordless-drill-review\">Milwaukee 2703-22</a>, have as many as 24.","The RK2852K2 produces up to 531 inch-pounds of torque, which is impressive. It&#39;s not the most powerful drill we tested, but it can still create holes fast. The drill uses 20-volt lithium-ion batteries, which are lightweight and powerful, and it comes with two of them. As such, you don&#39;t have to worry about stopping mid project because the battery dies – you can charge one while you use the other. However, it takes each battery a full hour to completely charge, which is a long time compared to others. However, once they are charged, they run for about 40 minutes, which is respectable.","This Rockwell cordless drill has an ergonomic design, so it&#39;s comfortable to hold. It’s lightweight, and the weight is balanced above and below the grip. Because of this, it doesn’t put unnecessary strain on your body and you are less likely to injure yourself.","It uses a half-inch keyless chuck, which means you can fasten bits to the drill by hand – this is convenient because you don’t need to keep track of a key while you work. The drill also has a bright LED work light that illuminates your workspace. This is especially helpful when you are working in low-light conditions.","If you have questions or concerns about the drill, you can contact Rockwell over the phone or via an email form on its website. You can also check out the online user manual if you misplace the copy that comes with the drill. The drill itself has a three-year warranty, and the batteries are covered for one year. Both warranties protect against defective parts."]},"id":"a3e0efa4-b179-4c27-800f-823996390b51","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1cfdf428-80d4-4707-a60f-873fad1f77e4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Rockwell RK2852K2 is a decent cordless drill with a lot of power and a comfortable design.
