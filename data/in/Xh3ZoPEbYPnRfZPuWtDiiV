Since you can switch between wearing it as a clip, wristband and necklace, the Shine 2 easily has the most versatile design in our review. It’s even waterproof, so you really can wear it everywhere.","The pedometer’s tracking accuracy is about average. It excelled during our testing with distance traveled and active minutes, but it missed about 15 percent of the steps we took. While that isn’t incredibly far off, it is inaccurate enough to limit how closely you can monitor your fitness. However, the Shine 2 is one of the best pedometer watches for tracking your movements while you swim. The app even tracks individual laps.","This fully waterproof pedometer can be submerged in up to 5 ATM (50 meters) of water, so you can wear it when you dive in a pool or are in the shower. The device’s coin cell battery lasts for six months, at which time it needs to be replaced. Because it uses this type of battery, you don’t have to worry about recharging the pedometer every few days.","One of the Shine 2’s best design features is its touch sensor, which works as a button and lets you switch between viewing a clock and your progress. Twelve small LED lights circle the rim of the pedometer’s face and light up to either show you the time or how close you are to meeting your step goal. For example, at 4:15 p.m. the clock lights up the 4:00 light and blinks the 3:00 light to indicate the hour and minutes. When you want to see your progress, if you’ve reached 75 percent of your step goal for the day, the LED lights between 12:00 and 9:00 light up. This sleek tracker also has a vibrating alarm you can set to wake you up in the morning or alert you when you haven’t moved in a while.","The best pedometers have accompanying apps that give you access to more data than is available on the device itself. The Misfit app shows you detailed information and a history of your progress. Since it syncs wirelessly via Bluetooth, transferring your data from the pedometer to your phone is hassle-free. The Misfit Shine 2 also vibrates when you have an incoming call, so you can pause your workout and chat on the phone if you so desire.","All the pedometers we reviewed have 12-month warranties, including the Misfit Shine 2. Misfit also provides technical support via email, but it doesn’t list a phone number on its website."]},"id":"293781d8-9110-4280-846c-d06ed178101f","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"43e199e5-5167-457a-a601-ecea1569ed7a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Misfit Shine 2 is one of the best wristband pedometers for walking because of the many ways you can wear it and its completely waterproof design.
