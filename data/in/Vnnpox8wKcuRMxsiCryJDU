This <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-microsoft-office-alternatives\">word processing software</a> works well with Microsoft Word; according to the company, it was specifically designed to be compatible with Word.","While it’s compatible with Word, it doesn&#39;t function in the same way that ubiquitous office application does. There are a lot of different button icons to memorize, which may present something of a learning curve if you are used to Word or other word processing software. It also doesn&#39;t use the same icon locations that are almost universally used by other word processing software.","This software has some of the most basic features that are offered by other word processing software. For example, you can highlight text, insert watermarks and change the page color. Multiple files are also easy to access, thanks to the handy tab organization of the file windows.","TextMaker&#39;s spellchecker can check the spelling of words in more than 75 different languages, including Arabic and Russian. The integrated thesaurus helps you find words in 33 languages, and the professional version of the software lets you look up words in German, English, French, Italian and Spanish.","The software also has many common collaboration tools, such as the ability to leave comments throughout a document. You can also track changes made to the document and reject changes you don&#39;t like.","Another unusual feature is that this word processing software line has an address book feature that will automatically fill in a name when you are writing a letter.","TextMaker has a fair number of publishing and editing tools which sets it in the same class with many desktop publishing software programs. It includes a way to fax and email documents from the software, so you don&#39;t have to copy and paste or switch screens. Along with common insert features, TextMaker has a few features that can add a little something extra to your reports and documents, including soft shadows, mirror effects, image manipulation and transparencies.","TextMaker can be used to open or create Word files, including .docx files. It can also open OpenOffice Open Document Text files, as well as create EPUB files and PDFs.","The TextMaker series of software has the basic features that that are required for most word processor users, and it also includes some useful layout features. While it’s simpler than other options, you won’t miss much, especially if you’re simply creating basic typed documents. All it all, this is a helpful alternative to Microsoft Word."]},"id":"353664e8-c3b8-4633-a2e0-237a667ed7c4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49282","url":"/textmaker-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-04-16T19:48:05Z","datePublished":"2010-04-16T19:48:05Z","name":"TextMaker","synopsis":"TextMaker word processing software is part of the SoftMaker Office suite, which includes a presentation program, spreadsheet software, and even the BasicMaker scripting language.","review":{"rating":65,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"TextMaker word processing software is part of the SoftMaker Office suite, which includes a presentation program, spreadsheet software, and even the BasicMaker scripting language.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-04-16T19:48:05Z","id":"Vnnpox8wKcuRMxsiCryJDU","meta":{"title":"TextMaker Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"TextMaker doesn&#8217;t offer a ton of extra features, but it is a good choice if you will only need word processing software for basic tasks.
