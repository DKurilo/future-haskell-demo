The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\"><em>top-load washing machines</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Maytag Bravos X HE MVWX600BW is a great mid-range top-loading washing machine. It has a large washtub capacity of 3.8 cubic feet to handle larger loads of laundry and a variety of wash options.","With this top-load washer, you get 11 cycles. The clean washer cycle is a convenient and easy way to keep your washer and your laundry clean and fresh. There is also a bulky cycle for when you need to wash bedding and other large, bulky items. You also have the option of a PowerWash to treat extra dirty loads.","In addition to these cycles, you have five wash options, five soil levels and five temperatures. Altogether, this gives you an ample set of wash combinations to handle a variety of load types. The wash options include an extra rinse and automatic fabric softener or OxiClean dispensing.","One of the most convenient features of this top-loading washing machine is its optimal dispenser drawer. You put in fabric softener, detergent or timed OxiClean into labeled compartments in the drawer. The machine will then automatically put it in your load at the right time according to what settings you select.","This top-load washing machine is energy efficient. It has an estimated operating cost of $14 annually and an estimated energy usage of 135-kilowatt hours every year. You can save even more energy by using this top loader&#39;s cold wash cycle option.","Additionally, like other energy-efficient models, this top-load washer has replaced the traditional agitator with Maytag&#39;s Fountain Impeller. This part cycles the water from the bottom of the tub up through the top to wash your laundry, using less energy and water compared to an agitator.","The warranty on this top-load washer is on the better end of all the washers we reviewed. It certainly takes into account the long life of this type of appliance. In addition to a one-year parts and labor warranty for the overall machine, a 10-year warranty covers the motor and stainless steel wash drum.","Maytag also gives you several options to get in contact with help and support representatives. You can call, email using a form on their website or use a live chat option. You can also find the owner&#39;s manual and some other helpful documents on the website."]},"id":"543278c4-cf45-4f29-ab51-8b83936da927","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a8822b62-3014-435a-acd2-3c44b3aacfd5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Maytag Bravos X HE MVWX600BW top-load washing machine is an energy-efficient unit with a considerate warranty.
