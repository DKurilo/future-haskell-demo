You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.","Compared to other eReaders, Kobo probably isn&#39;t a name that most people recognize. The Canadian company is a smaller manufacturer of e-ink devices, but with its wide variety of digital readers, Kobo has something for everyone. The Kobo Glo is a front-lit <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-e-readers,review-2766.html\">eBook reader</a> with many of the features that you find in devices like the Kindle Paperwhite and the Nook GlowLight, but it does not have the same level of simplicity and functionality of those devices.","Illumination is clearly the next frontier for cutting-edge eReaders, and Kobo wasted no time capitalizing on this growing trend with the Glo digital reader. The device is outfitted with Kobo&#39;s proprietary ComfortLight, which uniformly distributes ambient light across the screen. The Glo’s lighting is right on par with other leading front-lit readers, though the company claims the uniformity of the lighting transcends that of its competitors. We didn’t notice that much of a difference between the competing devices in that regard, but the Kobo Glo undeniably delivers an impressive reading experience. The light is remarkably even, with no irregular blemishes or bright spots, which makes the device completely readable in any environment. The screen also has a high contrast ratio – among the highest of any eReader we reviewed – that renders ultra-sharp text. We particularly like that turning the light on and off is as simple as pressing a button at the top of the eReader.","The only minor drawback in terms of readability is the Glo&#39;s minimum brightness; it’s a little too bright for the lowest setting, which might bother some people.","Like most dedicated eBook readers, the Kobo Glo was built for portability. Its small, featherweight design is ideal for long reading sessions at home or on the go. Additionally, integrated Wi-Fi enables you to connect to any wireless network to download new books. From a design perspective, the Glo is highly aesthetic, with an attractive chassis that’s available in four colors.","Perhaps the biggest difference between the Kobo Glo and other well-known eBook readers is its shorter battery life. The Glo’s battery can last approximately one month, assuming roughly 30 minutes of use each day. While it’s not probable that you’d go longer than 30 days without the ability to recharge, it is nearly half of what some other competing devices offer.","Kobo isn’t particularly known for its eBook store. However, you can instantly connect to it on your Kobo device and download new books. The eBooks are more expensive than the competition and, not surprisingly, Kobo’s selection isn’t quite as vast as big-name retailers, particularly when it comes to periodicals. Beyond that, you can sign up for 14-day trial subscriptions to magazines and newspapers but cannot purchase single issues.","The device has an approximate book capacity of 1,000 titles, which is typical of dedicated eReaders. For the rare bibliophile who fears that capacity simply won’t suffice, the device offers expandable memory up to 32GB.","If a highly customizable eReader and reading experience are important to you, the Kobo Glo is an excellent option to consider. The reader offers all of the basic features we look for in stand-alone eBook readers, including adjustable fonts, bookmarking and automatic eBook syncing across all of your devices.","Some of the unique reading features available on the Glo include Kobo Picks and Reading Life. Kobo Picks makes recommendations for books based on your past selections and preferences. Reading Life connects to your Facebook and Twitter accounts, so you can share what you’re reading, notes you’ve taken, and favorite quotes or passages. Kobo is definitely ahead of the curve in terms of social features on an eBook reader."]},"id":"107b700d-ca1b-454c-b600-2b10da51f7bb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a82f03e1-5082-49aa-94dd-2689d61b3890","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Despite being the industry underdog, the Kobo Glo proves to be a strong contender in the eReader space.
