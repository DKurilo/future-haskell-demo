This <a href=\"/best-ethernet-switches\">Ethernet switch</a> is part of the EdgeMAX platform of products from the Ubiquiti Networks brand and comes with business-level features in a compact design that also works for home users.","While this is not a plug-and-play design like the <a href=\"/d-link-review\">D-Link DGS-1008G</a> or <a href=\"/tp-link-review\">TP Link TL-SG1005D</a>, the Ubiquiti Networks switch does come with a number of customizable features. Through the deviceâ€™s online interface, known as EdgeOS, you can manage performance standards and customize settings. Each gigabit port operates as its own separate interface and can be customized accordingly.","You can customize a number of security features through this portal, which is especially useful if you are an enterprise user worried about the safety of your wired network. The dashboard displays statistics and gives you a virtual view of each port, including how it is operating. The device also comes with wall-mounting hardware; however, it is larger than some competing units, which can make wall storage difficult.","The front of the port features five different Ethernet routing ports along with a console port. There are also individual LED indicator lights that let you know how each port is performing. The light will be off if the port is down, yellow if it is operating at 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps, and green if it is operating at the max speed of 1,000 Mbps.","This Ethernet port is one of the few desktop devices that can route up to 1 million data packets per second, a feature that can help keep download and buffering times low.","Overall, if you are interested in an Ethernet switch that you can manage and customize to fit your needs, then this product has plenty of standout features. However, it only has five ports, and the customizable interface is designed for seasoned users. If you are looking for a simple plug-and-play design that will troubleshoot issues on its own, other Ethernet switches can do that better. If this type of robust home system is what you need for advanced network diagnostics and performance, the Ubiquiti Networks switch is worth considering."]},"id":"a1ec8d29-bb7a-4c1f-8b68-6a20cd0c0335","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66485","url":"/ubiquiti-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-07T15:37:47Z","datePublished":"2015-08-07T15:37:47Z","name":"Ubiquiti Networks EdgeRouter ERPoe-5","synopsis":"The Ubiquiti Networks ERPoe-5 EdgeRouter features a five-port design and the ability to support 24V or 48V passive PoE.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Ubiquiti Networks ERPoe-5 EdgeRouter features a five-port design and the ability to support 24V or 48V passive PoE.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-07T15:37:47Z","id":"AZaLiYLE6iNMvdCoPQbmqN","meta":{"title":"Ubiquiti Networks EdgeRouter ERPoe-5 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Ubiquiti Networks ERPoe-5 Edge Router features a customizable open platform and PoE capabilities.
