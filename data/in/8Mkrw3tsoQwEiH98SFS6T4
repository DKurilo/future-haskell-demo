The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about  <a href=\"/best-train-sets\">Train Sets</a> here.</em>","The Atlas Trainman is an HO<em> </em>train set that comes with four cars: a boxcar, gondola, covered hopper and caboose. The locomotive is built with a die cast underframe that makes it more durable than engines made out of plastic. The wheels of the freight cars are constructed out of metal, which adds realistic detail to the sturdy construction.","The round track measures 48 inches long.  One unusual feature is that you can separate the track from the roadbed.  The roadbed is the foundation that the track is attached to so your train can run, and most beginner train sets have tracks that are permanently affixed to the roadbed.  With this set you can snap the track apart from the roadbed and use it in bigger layouts, which makes the set easy to expand. The train set does require the use of tools for assembling the terminals, but the track pieces snap together easily on a flat surface.","This model train set offers multiple speeds, so your train can go fast or slow.  However, this is an entry level train set that lacks extras. It does not have an air whistle or bells. It also lacks smoke effects and an operating smoke stack. There is a lot of detail in the design of the freight cars, engine and caboose, but there are no lighted interiors.","There are no accessories included with this electric train set, so you will have to purchase figurines and signs separately. The HO Scale size is popular, so you will have no problem finding compatible accessories to purchase separately.","The Atlas Trainman website does not have a contact number or email. There is a FAQs page. If you need help with repairs or have warranty questions, you will have difficulty getting support."]},"id":"3a2c13c6-2e73-45ab-9892-a0b502edb788","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"91d287fd-80cd-4924-b003-dc3486d44cb2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This starter train set offers the basics to get started.
