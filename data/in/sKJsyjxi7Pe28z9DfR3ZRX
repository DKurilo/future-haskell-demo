This unique social media has more than 100 million people staying connected with friends and family through quick, spontaneous communication – and its moving beyond sharing videos and quick texts. With Snapcash, a <a href=\"/best-p2p-payments\">person-to-person payment</a> function within the app, you can send your friend that $15 you owe her from lunch or ask your brother for the $20 he borrowed to get your mom a birthday present.","The app is easy to use. You type in a dollar amount, and the green Snapcash button appears. If you tap on the button, it sends that amount. Your friend gets a notice of the transaction and taps to receive the cash. He or she needs to input a debit card to get the money, and if he does not do so within 24 hours, the money is refunded to you.","The Snapcash function is only available to U.S. residents over 18. You need to link a standard U.S.-issued Visa or MasterCard debit card to your account. It only works in the actual states of the United States. People in territories like Puerto Rico or Guam cannot use Snapcash, nor can military on bases outside the continental U.S., Alaska and Hawaii.","Like Snapchat, Snapcash works on Apple or Android phones. You need to provide a debit card as your funding source. However, like most P2P payment processors, you are charged a fee of three percent of the transaction amount if you use your credit card. Snapchat works with Square, one of the leading mobile payment processors, to handle transactions. By signing on for Snapcash, you are also linked to the Square Cash network, so if you have friends who are not on Snapchat, you can do financial transactions with them through that app.","In general, you are limited to $250 in any single transaction or total transactions over a seven-day period. If you need to send more, such as to loan your child rent money for a month, you can transfer up to $2,500 with additional identification.","These peer-to-peer payment transactions are PCI DSS secured at the level of Square&#39;s eCommerce transactions, so you have the same internet security as online businesses. Within Snapchat itself, you can set your options to include a security code before sending money. This is a good idea to keep someone from using your phone or Snapchat account to send money in your name. If you have other issues with a transaction, you need to take it up with Square.","Despite the security, Snapchat limits its Snapcash transactions to personal use only. You cannot use it for business transactions, including payment for snaps or stories on Snapchat.","For U.S.-based Snapchat users, Snapcash provides a convenient way to transfer money between friends and family who use the app. In addition, it links you to Square Cash, so people using that app can also send or receive funds. While secure enough for business, it is only for person-to-person payments."]},"id":"0559879f-9c71-45ae-a65d-d7c7d781e5b2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67660","url":"/snapcash-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-02-05T17:31:53Z","datePublished":"2016-02-05T17:31:53Z","name":"Snapcash","synopsis":"Do you Snapchat?
