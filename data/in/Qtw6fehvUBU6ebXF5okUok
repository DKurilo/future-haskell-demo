The cheaper plan, Brinks Home Complete, starts at $29 a month. It also costs $399 upfront for the following Alarm.com equipment: an IG Gen 2 Security Panel, a motion detector and three doors or window sensors. The starting costs are some of the highest among home security monitoring services. However, you can spread the equipment costs throughout your contract with zero-down, zero-interest financing through GreenSky, provided you have good credit. This will result in a small increase of around $11 to your monthly payments.","All Brinks monitoring plans come with a three-year contract, which is the most common length among home security monitoring companies, including <a href=\"/adt-review\">ADT</a> and <a href=\"/link-interactive-review\">Link Interactive</a>. It&#39;s disappointing that the company no longer offers a shorter contract as it did with LiveWatch. If you want to cancel your contract before three years, you can expect to pay 80 percent of the remaining balance, which isn&#39;t as competitive with many other home monitoring companies we reviewed.","Fortunately, you have 90 days after you sign your contract to cancel without any terminations fees, this is the second-most generous return policy we&#39;ve seen since ADT&#39;s six-month return policy is twice as long."]},"id":"a6e163ad-d9b8-4877-8a65-6bf632deda5c","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/9pVWAeFsMXqKczshPmiX7m.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/69968-brinks-home-security3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9pVWAeFsMXqKczshPmiX7m.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"9pVWAeFsMXqKczshPmiX7m","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9pVWAeFsMXqKczshPmiX7m.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c457bb90-25b0-4c38-a7e3-0714d059e422","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Brinks Home Security has a better variety of installation options than any other company we evaluated. Two options, self- and professional installation, are available if you sign up for a monitoring plan through Brinks while a third installation option, DIY, is available to people who buy the Nest Secure DIY security system.","If you want to install the system yourself, Brinks Home Security will preprogram the equipment and ship it to your home, where you place the devices using helpful tutorials. There&#39;s no installation fee if you choose this option. If you want to pay a one-time $49 fee, you can get a lifetime warranty for self-installed systems, or forego this fee for two-year warranty coverage instead.","For professional installation, a Brinks Home Security installer does all of the work by setting up your equipment, then shows you how to use it. Professional installation comes with a lifetime warranty, but adds $199 to your starting costs or $10 to your monthly fees.","Finally, if you want to program and set up equipment on your own, you can buy the <a href=\"/nest-secure-review\">Nest Secure</a> DIY security system. This system is available at retail, but can still get Brinks&#39; 24/7 monitoring. It&#39;s monitoring fees are lower than the traditional plans and you have the option of no-contract monitoring for $29 a month or $19 a month, if you sign a three-year contract. Of course, you need to pay upfront for all of the equipment in this option, but it helps give Brinks an edge over competitors, by being the only home monitoring company with three installation options."]},"id":"a0735a00-7de4-4869-8928-398c23978933","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/mUbRqmmFm4SFvCtCgBtngf.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/69968-brinks-home-security2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mUbRqmmFm4SFvCtCgBtngf.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"mUbRqmmFm4SFvCtCgBtngf","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mUbRqmmFm4SFvCtCgBtngf.jpg","alt":""},"id":"5b6b9a35-80d4-47de-b499-e7b0b10bbd34","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you want smart home devices in your home monitoring system, you have the best options with Brinks Home Security, since it&#39;s compatible with more smart home devices than other home security companies.
