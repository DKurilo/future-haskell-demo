With 29 workout presets and 25 levels of resistance, it’s the most impressive upright bike in its price range. With an MSRP of $699, it has programs for heart rate training, intervals and weight loss. You can also create customized workouts.","The Nautilus U618 is the only machine we reviewed that comes with a wireless chest strap. Like each of the exercise bikes we considered, it also has pulse grips that monitor your heart rate during workouts. This is important to help you stay in the target zone as you work toward your personal fitness goals.","This exercise bike’s maximum user weight is 325 pounds, which is slightly above the most common weight limit we noted of 300 pounds. If you’re looking for a higher weight capacity, the Exerpeutic Gold 575 XLS can accommodate users weighing up to 400 pounds. Another advantage of the Exerpeutic is that it folds for storage. While the U618 doesn’t fold, it does have many features the Exerpeutic – a much cheaper exercise bike – is lacking. These include adjustable handlebars, a water bottle holder, a cooling fan, speakers and an aux port. The Nautilus also has an adjustable console.","Like all the best exercise bikes we considered, the Nautilus machine has an adjustable, padded seat. It has both fore/aft and height settings to customize the saddle, and its Nautilus Gel cushions your glutes as you ride. To help keep your feet in place, its pedals have straps. They’re also weighted to give you smoother pedaling.","One drawback of the U618 is that it requires an app to store user profiles and workout data. While it has Bluetooth connectivity for easy syncing, some consumers prefer machines with consoles more like the <a href=\"/schwinn-270-recumbent-review\">Schwinn 270 Recumbent</a>’s user interface, which lets you store up to four user profiles on-board. Keep in mind that upright and recumbent bikes have several significant differences. Choosing which type to buy depends on factors such as your fitness goals, rehabilitative needs and mobility.","If you buy the U618, you can track your workout metrics on the free <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nautilus.omni&amp;hl=en_US\">Nautilus Trainer 2 app</a>. You can also sync with <a href=\"http://www.ridesocial.com/\">RideSocial</a> for a mixed-reality riding experience on trails around the world. To offer a realistic, enjoyable ride, this bike has adjustable, multi-position handlebars with integrated incline and resistance controls. It also has a device rack for your tablet and an accessory holder for your smartphone.","This exercise bike has assembled dimensions of 38.5 x 24 x 58.3 inches (length, width, height), and it weighs 83.1 pounds. It has transport wheels for easier handling and leveling feet for stable placement. It also has a high speed, high inertia drive system, and its flywheel weighs 30 pounds. It features a DualTrack LCD display, with a main screen measuring 5 x 3 inches and a 5 x 1-inch secondary screen. Its console plugs in to any standard wall outlet, and an AC power adapter is included with the machine.","Nautilus warranties the U618’s frame for 15 years – a respectable warranty, but not the best we found. If you’re looking for a lifetime frame warranty, the <a href=\"/proform-review\">ProForm 8.0 EX</a> and the <a href=\"/nordictrack-gx-4.4-pro-review\">NordicTrack GX 4.4 Pro</a> have this coverage. Common among most manufacturers, including Nautilus, ProForm and NordicTrack, parts and labor warranties are much more limited. The U618’s parts and electronics are covered for three years, with labor coverage provided for just a year. Nautilus’ customer service is available by phone and email, and we had positive experiences when we reached out with questions."]},"id":"75dc99a1-266c-41a2-8642-0f008f383496","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70186","url":"/nautilus-u618-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-08-29T16:13:24Z","datePublished":"2018-08-29T16:13:24Z","name":"Nautilus U618","synopsis":"We chose the Nautilus U618 as our best pick in exercise bikes because it has so many features to maximize comfort, convenience and performance.
