In an industry where decent trainer planes cost $130 and advanced models can cost two to three times as much, an aircraft priced as low as this one can seem like a catch. If you’ve never piloted a model plane before, the Duet has its appeal, but you miss out on some cool advanced features that come standard with other planes.","The Duet comes preassembled in the box, a small polystyrene model that’s 15 inches from nose to tail with a 20.5-inch wingspan. It doesn’t have a rudder; instead, the plane’s twin propellers are differentially thrusted – they can spin at different speeds, allowing the plane to turn. In our experience, differential thrust isn’t as responsive as a rudder, but it’s adequate.","Also merely adequate is the Duet’s radio transmitter. The other RC airplane kits we tested include Spektrum or E-flite transmitters in their boxes – highly capable devices with four-channel support and the ability to be re-bound to other planes. The Duet’s transmitter only supports three channels and can’t be re-bound, so you can’t buy the cheaper, bind-and-fly versions of other planes and migrate the transmitter from aircraft to aircraft.","While its transmitter may be underwhelming and its lack of ailerons or a rudder make acrobatics difficult, the Duet is still a capable aircraft. Like the best RC planes for beginners, it’s quite durable – we crashed it repeatedly during our tests, and it remains as airworthy now as it was fresh out of the box. Those crashes are going to happen; without SAFE flight assistance or a gyroscope of any sort, the Duet bows to high winds and can be easily blown off-course."]},"id":"1a259ecb-45b5-4a5e-8ce2-9267d09d1291","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a704d964-afaa-4282-9174-e84d2bf08d52","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When we review remote control airplanes, we look for aircraft that are easy to fly, capable in the air and durable enough to shrug off inevitable impacts.
