The retail giant’s version of Black Friday is likely to be held in the summer months, this year, as usual. So what can we expect from Amazon’s biggest shopping day of the calendar? What are the best Amazon Prime Day deals that we’re likely to see? And when is Amazon Prime Day 2019, anyway?","Given that Amazon Prime Day 2018 was the biggest day of sales the online retailer has ever had, we imagine Amazon Prime Day 2019 will be even bigger and better this time around. Here’s everything you need to know about Amazon’s sale bonanza this year - and how to bag the best Prime Day deals.","<strong>When is Amazon Prime Day 2019? </strong>","Amazon hasn’t officially announced the date of Prime Day 2019 yet, but it’s usually held in the second week of July - and we expect to see the same again this year, with Monday July 8, 2019 a strong contender for the event.","Last year, Amazon Prime Day was pushed back to accommodate the World Cup semi finals: it started at 3pm on July 16, and stretched into an unprecedented 36-hour event, lasting until midnight on July 17. (If the retailer follows this new date format, then Amazon Prime Day 2019 will fall on Monday July 15 instead.)","It’s highly likely that that, once again, the company will look to top last year - perhaps transforming Amazon Prime Day 2019 into a whopping 48-hour event, with more deals and discounts than ever before. However Amazon decides to play it, we’ll be working hard to bring you the very best Amazon Prime Day deals here on this page, so you can be sure you’re making the biggest savings possible on the products you want.  ","<strong>Amazon Prime Day deals: what we expect to see in 2019</strong>","If this year is anything like previous events, we can expect to see some of the best Amazon Prime Day deals on the company’s own smart devices again, particularly the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-And-Alexa-Devices/b/ref=amb_link_4?ie=UTF8&amp;node=9818047011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-leftnav&amp;pf_rd_r=RG27GKR36BVHAMR80N0V&amp;pf_rd_r=RG27GKR36BVHAMR80N0V&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=76b5be21-6baf-4df5-86ec-44550036fae5&amp;pf_rd_p=76b5be21-6baf-4df5-86ec-44550036fae5&amp;pf_rd_i=9818047011\">Echo family</a> of smart speakers, Amazon’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-Tablet-Family/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=6669703011\">Fire</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=d_devcp_kindle_text/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_deviceCP_md1_w?ie=UTF8&amp;node=6669702011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-top-2&amp;pf_rd_r=M5CKWJ6DQSEPYMD97VST&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=12532529-74fe-4b68-8961-93cf88d8719a&amp;pf_rd_i=2102313011\">Kindle</a> tablets, and its <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=d_devcp_smp_text/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_deviceCP_md1_w?ie=UTF8&amp;node=8521791011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-top-2&amp;pf_rd_r=M5CKWJ6DQSEPYMD97VST&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=12532529-74fe-4b68-8961-93cf88d8719a&amp;pf_rd_i=2102313011\">Fire TV</a> streaming devices. There are likely to be heavily discounted trials of Amazon services like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited\">Amazon Music Unlimited</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/signup\">Kindle Unlimited</a>, and the <a href=\"https://twitch.amazon.com/prime/country\">Twitch Prime</a> gaming service, too.","We also think Amazon will continue last year’s trend of offering more Prime Day deals on niche connected products: think smart home-security systems, smart door locks and doorbells, smart thermostats, smart lightbulbs and so on. After all, it makes sense - Amazon is looking to drive long-term loyalty, and these products and services are all either gateway devices into the Amazon ecosystem, or add-ons for those who have already committed.","Will we see big price drops on consumer electronics like TVs, laptops and cameras? Sure, there will likely be a few bargains to be found. Last year we saw $200 cut from the price of the TCL 49-inch 4K Smart Roku TV, taking it down to just $399.99; and an Acer Chromebook 11 on sale for just $139.99 ($80 off). Amazon also slashed 34% off the Microsoft Surface Pro, and sold the original (albeit superseded) Sony A7 camera at the lowest price we’d ever seen for a full-frame camera. But make no mistake: the real focus of this event will be Amazon.","<strong>How to get the best Amazon Prime Day deals in 2019</strong>","The easiest way to get the best Amazon Prime Day deals this summer is to stick with us.

If you’re not a Prime member already and don’t want to sign-up for a year’s subscription, it isn’t game over though: there are two ways you can participate.","Firstly, you can take advantage of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime/trial\">Amazon’s free 30-day Prime trial</a>. Just make sure you don’t sign up too early, and that you cancel before the month’s subscription period is up - as long as you don’t go over the 30 days there are no strings attached. Alternatively, you can pay $13 for a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime\">one-month Prime membership</a> and benefit from all the advantages that come with Prime: free same-day and one-day delivery; unlimited streaming of movies and TV episodes on Prime Video; unlimited, ad-free access to Prime Music; Prime Reading; and loads more.","Aside from checking this page for the hottest offers, here are some more pro tips for making sure you really do bag a bargain during the event:"]},"id":"c496e794-540a-4ca3-b15f-52f8e7c38416","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Do your homework: know what you want to buy and create a shopping list before Prime Day to ensure you stay focused","Use <a href=\"https://camelcamelcamel.com/\">CamelCamelCamel.com</a> to check the Amazon price history of a product and ascertain whether it really is a good deal","Use <a href=\"https://www.google.com/shopping\">Google Shopping</a> to see what other retailers are selling it for and ensure the Amazon Prime Day price is, indeed, the lowest available","Add <a href=\"http://fakespot.com/\">Fakespot.com</a> to your bookmarks - this service helps you determine whether the Amazon user reviews for a product are legit or fake"],"type":"ul"},"id":"043db7fa-4e14-425d-9fd9-e90d94ab54c9","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["BuyingGuidesMarker-104729"]},"id":"fa9e7895-be84-4dd0-9eee-89e4c2aa7132","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["BuyingGuidesMarker-104729"]},"id":"fa9e7895-be84-4dd0-9eee-89e4c2aa7132","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_333","url":"/best-prime-day-deals","authors":[{"email":"william.bommer@futurenet.com","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-04-15T15:00:00Z","datePublished":"2019-04-15T15:00:00Z","name":"The best Amazon Prime Day deals 2019: what we expect to see","synopsis":"Amazon Prime Day 2018 starts on Monday, July 16 at 3 p.m. ET.
