This LG dishwasher features steam wash cycles, which use high-power spray and steam power to clean even the dirtiest dishes.","This LG TrueSteam model runs at a quiet 48 decibels. You get a generous seven wash cycles and nine different wash options with this LG dishwasher. Additionally, you have plenty of room in the unit and can load up to 14 place settings into a single load. This dishwasher also has three racks instead of the standard two. This dishwasher uses three spray arms to clean your dishes.","The seven wash cycles this dishwasher has are steam power, steam dual, steam delicate, normal, quick and dry, quick and rinse only. The nine additional wash options this dishwasher includes are extra dry, rinse, spray intensity, half load, delay start, sanitary, eco, extra rinse and a child lock option.","While you&#39;ll find many standard dishwasher features on this unit, it doesn&#39;t have a full heated dry option. Instead, it has LG’s hybrid drying system that doesn’t use a heating element to dry the dishes, but uses both the heat obtained from the cycle and a fan to help dry the dishes. Although this drying system is more energy efficient, a heated dry option would be nice to see.","You will also find an eco-friendly wash function available with this built-in dishwasher in its eco wash option. This wash option, when selected, will automatically use less water, which will help to conserve energy usage. However, this wash cycle is only recommended with lightly and moderately soiled dishes, not heavily soiled dishes.","According to the unit&#39;s EnergyGuide, it&#39;s estimated to cost you a low $27 per year to operate, and it will only consume 245 kilowatt-hours of energy per year, both of which are among the lowest of all the units we reviewed.","LG offers an impressive warranty with its dishwashers. This unit has a standard one-year warranty on labor, a two-year warranty on parts, a five-year warranty on racks and electronics, and a lifetime warranty on its tub and door liner.","If you need any technical support or simply have questions about this dishwasher, you can contact LG by phone, email and live chat. Additionally, you can access the user manual and video tutorials on the manufacturer&#39;s website."]},"id":"4e80b48a-ac2c-4dac-878e-6c9844aa05dc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"16e094d1-b567-4215-832b-033245286659","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This integrated dishwasher by LG gives you its TrueSteam technology and takes away the need to presoak or wash your dishes before you run them through a cycle.
