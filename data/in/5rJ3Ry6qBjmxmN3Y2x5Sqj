You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Magma Newport II <a href=\"/best-infrared-grills\">infrared grill</a> has a simple design that emphasizes portability. The grill also has marine-grade stainless steel that can withstand the salty spray of the ocean, which makes it ideal for boating. However, this tabletop grill only offers an average heat consistency and grilling experience.","The Magma Newport II is one of two infrared grills in our review that uses sear-plate technology. The other is the <a href=\"/char-broil-commercial-review\">Char-Broil Commercial</a> grill. Sear plates are stainless steel plates that rest below the cooking grate and distribute the heat from a steel-tube burner. This infrared gas grill&#39;s single 11,200-Btu burner preheats the grates to 500 degrees Fahrenheit in five and a half minutes, which is average for infrared grills.","The sear plates performed well in our heat consistency test. For the most part, they spread the heat evenly, but there were a couple noticeable hot spots. In our long test, the grill maintained a relatively stable temperature that only varied by 45 degrees. While this is a good result, it&#39;s not as consistent as the best infrared grill in our review.","In our infrared barbecue tests, this grill was able to handle steak, chicken and fish without any problems. With hamburgers, grease collected on the sear plates and produced more smoke than grills with other infrared cooking systems. This grease means more effort goes into cleaning the plates when you finish grilling. The infrared barbecue grill can use natural gas as a fuel source with a conversion kit. While the Magma Newport II has a temperature gauge, there are no numbers to indicate how hot it is inside the grill. This infrared grill has a small 162-square-inch primary cooking area with no warming rack, so it&#39;s not that convenient for cooking for crowds.","This grill was designed with the ocean in mind. This means that its stainless steel construction is especially durable compared to that of lower-ranked grills in our review. The cooking grates and drip pan are also made of stainless steel that requires moderate effort to clean. The legs of the Magma Newport II fold out of the way when not in use. To use this grill on a boat, you need a mounting bracket to keep it in place on choppy water. Magma sells a variety of accessories for this grill, including carrying bags and covers.","The warranty only covers the grill for one year. This is much shorter than the warranties on the best infrared barbecue grills. Magma offers technical support by email and telephone. The company website has many helpful FAQs and user manuals to help you learn how to use the grill."]},"id":"a98b5075-822a-473b-9a20-ce8513e7c8ed","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"41467236-e059-471d-b26e-81006f3868d6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Magma Newport II stands out in terms of durability and grilling experience.
