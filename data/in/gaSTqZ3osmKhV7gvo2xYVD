You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The ThetaLux Pro gives off a brightness per watt that&#39;s higher than average for the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/light-bulb-guide,review-1986.html\">LED lights</a> we reviewed. This LED solid-state lighting has a lifespan of 25,000 hours. It&#39;s not as bright as some LED bulbs we reviewed, but it has a higher than average ratio of brightness per watt.","<strong>Features </strong><br/>This 9-watt LED bulb is advertized as being as bright as a 75-watt bulb. However, it only puts off a brightness of 700 lumens. A standard 60-watt incandescent bulb gives off 840 lumens. The ThetaLux Pro provides 78 lumens per watt, which is a higher ratio than many of the other energy-efficient light bulbs we reviewed.","These energy-efficient light bulbs last for 25,000 hours. The ThetaLux Pro is UL listed and FCC approved. This means that these light bulbs have passed required safety inspections and don&#39;t disrupt radio signals. You can operate this LED solid-state lighting in temperatures between -4 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit.","The LED lamp we reviewed is cool white with a color temperature of 5,000 Kelvin. This bulb also comes in warm white. The ThetaLux Pro scores 80 on the color rendering index (CRI). This index measures how close to natural daylight colors appear in artificial light sources. Compared to the other LED lights we reviewed, 80 is about average.","Inside this light bulb are six light-emitting diodes. Compared to some of the other LED bulbs, this is not very many. However, some of the other manufacturers wouldn&#39;t share that information at all.","<strong>Design </strong><br/>This standard A19 bulb has a frosted polycarbonate lens with an aluminum heat sink that connects the base of the bulb to the lighted globe. The beam spread on this globe is 180 degrees. Most of the LED lights we reviewed are omni-directional, meaning they have an even beam spread around the whole bulb.","The dimensions of the bulb are slightly different from an incandescent bulb. The maximum overall length of the ThetaLux Pro is 4.5 inches, while an incandescent is usually about 4.25 inches. The diameter of this LED lamp is 2.36 inches. This is almost inconsequentially thinner than an incandescent bulb. The weight of this LED bulb, however, is much heavier than that of an incandescent light. While an incandescent bulb is about 1 ounce, this bulb is about 8 ounces. This additional weight is from the heat sink that draws heat away from the light-emitting diodes to preserve the lifespan of the light bulb.","<strong>Help &amp; Support </strong><br/>The ThetaLux Pro comes with a three-year limited warranty. If you have questions about the warranty or the bulb, you can contact EarthLED, the manufacturer, via telephone or email. EarthLED also lists its mailing address."]},"id":"308b0154-3ccb-435e-86d0-6082ca9920d2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e4fe99e9-bb41-4b9f-9c6e-07ea3e829cb8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ThetaLux Pro is LED solid-state lighting with a beam spread of 180 degrees.
