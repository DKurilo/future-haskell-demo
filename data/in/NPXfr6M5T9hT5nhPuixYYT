It offers dual screens that are brighter than average and a longer battery life than the regular DS hand held game system. However, Nintendo has changed the design of the buttons a bit to increase your usability. One of the best features for those who love the Game Boy Advance is that DS Lite will still allow you to play those games."]},"id":"dc7cf1ab-210e-49df-88b4-e5ddaf99a496","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"c11e78ad-44d9-45c6-a8e2-38c242f574bc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["One of the features we like about this hand held game is that it offers dual screens that are ultra bright. This allows you to see twice the action while playing your games. Additionally, this portable game comes with touch screen technology that will allow you to play games that require a stylus. A stylus acts as a pen that you can use to write or draw things on your hand held game device&#39;s touchscreen.","While this device does not come with a webcam, it does have several other features that will help you get the most out of your gaming. Because the DS Lite is one of the smaller hand held game players we reviewed, portability is not a problem. This hand held game device will go anywhere you go because it is compact enough to slide right into your pocket. Because the battery life is about 30 percent better than other hand held game players we reviewed, you will not have to worry about stopping to charge your system as often either.","This portable game console has the largest color selection of all the devices we reviewed. There are more than 10 different colors and styles for this product, which is much more than the one or two colors that some competitors offer.","This handheld gaming unit has built-in Wi-Fi so you can connect to other devices in the same vicinity. If you are in an area with a wireless connection, you can play opponents online. Having this opportunity will allow you to keep up with the latest games while finding new opponents to play all of the time."]},"id":"27d08be3-4351-4e6b-9884-e728ebe36026","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Physical Features"},"id":"cb642f33-cbef-431c-bd0d-dc4b786d7964","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This handheld gaming unit has an available memory of 256MB and a 133MHz processor.
