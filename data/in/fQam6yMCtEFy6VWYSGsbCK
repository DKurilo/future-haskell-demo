The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-document-scanners\"><em>Document Scanners</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Epson Workforce Pro is a high quality scanner. It is fast and efficient. Simply load the papers you want into the document scanner and let it run. With a higher sheet capacity than any of its competitors, the Epson model is a perfect fit for you if you have a large number of documents that need to be scanned. The Epson Workforce Pro is reliable and has a high sheet capacity. However, unlike some other similar models, it does not have the ability to import documents and receipts directly into other software applications."]},"id":"72a95647-9684-4448-a146-a7aa851caadd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"440ed18e-913d-44c6-83d2-b52bcd97d882","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Epson scanner is much more than a simple, flat-bed document scanner. It looks and feels more like a fax machine. And like a fax machine, you can load multiple sheets into the scanner at the same time and it will make easy work of transporting all of your documents to your computer. This sheet-fed scanner can handle up to 75 different sheets of paper at the same time.","The document scanner has the capabilities to scan all different sizes of paper. Whether you need to transfer all your receipts to your computer for tax purposes or you are trying to save a digital copy of legal documents, this document scanner can handle it all. And all the pages can be assorted sizes. You can mix and match sizes within the same stack of scanning.","Another handy feature with this document scanner which helps you save time is that there is no warm-up time. From the moment you turn on your scanner, it is ready to go. This document scanner uses an LED technology, not mercury, and it will even use less energy than other similar document scanners. Because the LED scanning technology lights are on both sides of the bar that papers pass through, the scanner will scan both sides of the documents with one pass. You will not have to pass the paper through the scanner twice.","As your documents are scanned, you can select an option to directly import them to a PDF file format. This is probably the most common option and is one of the best for most business and personal use. This document scanner also comes with drivers that will help import the documents to a readable PDF. The optical character recognition (OCR) options are fantastic. As you begin scanning, the software will recognize words and you will be able to use searches to find important parts of the documents. This is especially useful if you are loading large amounts of data on your computer, and it can help you save time by not having to read through each section of data. This can also be helpful when you’re trying to file all the data. Simply do a search for the information you are looking to file, and the software will be able to find it, even if it is in a PDF file format.","While PDF files are the most common, the document scanner can import documents and photos into other file formats as well. Some of the other common formats include JPEG and TIFF file formats. The desktop scanner will also work well with photos and images."]},"id":"175630b0-a63e-458c-ab7f-cc91683fbb54","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"e951220d-3b7b-4747-9a77-170de1572216","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Epson document scanner is compatible with Mac and Windows operating systems. The scanner is simply connected to your computer via a USB cable. Even though it is not a wireless connection, it is still extremely simple to do and very reliable. The software and drivers included with the scanner are quick and easy to install. The drivers will help your computer recognize the scanner. And the OCR software will help save you time and make your documents simple to organize. The instruction manual and tutorial are clear and easy to follow.","The document scanner has a terrific optical resolution that allows you to save all of your documents at a very high quality. The 600 dpi optical resolution is enough to keep a high quality copy of all your documents and images.","The digital filing system can process 75 pages at a time, which is more than any other similar product we reviewed. These pages can vary in length, height and width. It can process receipts, tax records, personal records or any other document or image you might need to save. This document scanner is a perfect fit for business or personal records. Whether you need a scanner to process and save payroll documents for your small business or you simply want to keep a record of your personal tax documents, this scanner is a wonderful option.","The Epson Workforce Pro&#39;s controls are simple to see and are very clearly labeled, so using the scanner does not take much time to understand. And if, for whatever reason, you encounter any problems with the machine, it is likely that you will be able to find the solution in the many customer support options offered by the manufacturer."]},"id":"a2e3227e-5db3-4a64-ad42-98a10d30e734","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Help &amp; Support"},"id":"2e364ca9-30d7-4dd7-b23c-393ced2629d9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The manufacturer of this Epson document scanner has an assortment of outlets for customer service.
