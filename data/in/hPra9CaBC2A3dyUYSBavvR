However, when we say “value,” we mean more than just low price – the insurer’s benefits are still helpful and can cover the cost of eye exams and corrective lenses.","EyeMed Healthy is the lowest price plan, with premiums of $5 a month. Only <a href=\"/eyebenefits-review\">EyeBenefits</a> is cheaper, but EyeMed Healthy has a much stronger collection of benefits. EyeMed Bold costs $17 a month and has benefits that compare with standard plans offered by other insurers. EyeMed Bright is the family plan and starts at $30 a month but varies depending on the number of dependents you have.","We focused on the EyeMed Healthy plan for this review. This plan’s best feature is it has a $0 copay on annual eye exams – EyeMed covers the entire cost. An eye exam can cost as much as $200 when you pay without insurance, depending on the doctor. However, the rest of the plan’s benefits are weaker. You only get a 35-percent discount on frames and a 15-percent discount on contact lenses. Single-vision lenses cost you $55, and lens treatments like UV protections and tinting run between $12 and $40.","EyeMed Bold’s benefits are more in line with industry standards. Eye exams have a $10 copay, which is among the lowest we saw. Under this plan, there’s no copay on frames or contact lenses, and you get a $130 frame allowance with a 20-percent discount on anything you spend beyond that. Lenses have a $20 copay and common enhancements like UV treatments have no copays.","The Bright Vision plan is geared toward families. It has a $10 copay for exams and an expanded frame or contacts benefits of $200, with 20 percent off the remaining balance.","EyeMed has a network of more than 44,000 providers, and you can use its website to see if your usual doctor is part of the network. If they aren’t, you can still see them as an out-of-network provider. Out of network, you get reimbursed $30 for eye exams on all plans. Reimbursement for eye exams is the only out-of-network benefit on the Healthy Vision plan. However, if you opt for the Bold Vision or Bright Vision plan, you’re reimbursed on frames and contact lenses, between $65 and $160 depending on the plan you choose."]},"id":"f1a54353-5b84-4c80-9306-a8bf484ef5b9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49440","url":"/eyemed-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-05-03T23:20:20Z","datePublished":"2010-05-03T23:20:20Z","name":"EyeMed","synopsis":"EyeMed is our choice for best value vision insurance provider because it has the most affordable insurance plans.","review":{"rating":92,"verdict":"EyeMed has a wide range of plans, including some of the most affordable options we saw.
