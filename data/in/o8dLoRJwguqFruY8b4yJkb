The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-dvd-ripper-software\">DVD Ripper Software</a> here.</em>","Much like many of our other featured DVD rippers, CyberLink<strong> </strong>Power2Go, in addition to being a solid DVD ripper software, is a multimedia suite replete with additional functions. You’ll find helpful tools and utilities that will allow you to make the most of your multimedia library. Whether formatting home movies for use on different devices or transferring recorded TV to DVD, CyberLink Power2Go is a useful program to have on hand.","Whether you utilize virtual disc drives, or just like to backup your DVDs as image files, CyberLink Power2Go will be a good fit—it both creates ISO files and burns ISO to DVD discs. And for lighter video files, CyberLink Power2Go creates VCD discs so you can transfer video on cheaper blank CDs rather than waste or clog up DVDs. You can also use BDXL discs, which allow you to burn up to 128GB on a single disc. The desktop burning gadget that goes with this program makes the burning process as easy and dragging and dropping files into folders on your hard drive. CyberLink Power2Go provides DVD editing options that allow you to combine various video clips and create or modify title menus. In the audio department, CyberLink Power2Go handles all of your MP3/WAV/WMA ripping and transferring needs. Users are able to edit audio in the program with a new feature called WaveEditor.","CyberLink Power2Go is good for advanced audio ripping and is a decent contender for basic DVD and Blu-ray ripping, but the limited file format options and lack of a video converter limit the program significantly. If you need to convert your DVD video for your iPhone, PC or Mac, we would recommend the higher ranked programs in this category. We would like to inform our readers that CyberLink respects the law when it comes to copyright and intellectual property. CyberLink Power2Go does not decrypt copyrighted or DRM enabled DVD, Blu-ray or media discs. People have always had problems getting files or folders out to .ISO images.  With this program, you can go into an .ISO image and get files out like it was a folder on your desktop.  The program comes with the ability to make interactive slideshows that maintain the original quality of your images as well.","We can’t deny that Power2Go is pretty straightforward in the user interface department. We also liked the drag-and-drop DVD burning tool that appears in the Windows Sidebar. It really isn’t useful for much more than creating 1:1 DVD copies, but nonetheless, it is a quick and easy means of creating a DVD backup on the fly. The proper dashboard is mostly intuitive and makes ripping an image file of a DVD or making a DVD from an image file as easy as can be expected. Our test burns resulted in DVDs indistinguishable from the original disc. Creating a DVD from an ISO or ripping an ISO from a DVD is simple, but sadly, CyberLink Power2Go does not support video conversion. DVD to AVI/DivX/MOV is not possible without using a discrete video converter.","We also liked Power2Go’s auto scaling feature that will shrink a video to fit a disc with limited space. Be careful with this feature though, as a large video file burned onto a half full DVD will yield an unwatchable, low res video. CyberLink has forums and software tickets for technical issues. CyberLink also provides phone support plans for about $15 per month. For $15 you can also purchase a “software FAQ.” We recommend browsing user forums for free if you have any specific problems."]},"id":"a1a26e47-b064-47aa-ac11-e3a6376287ea","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b33488bf-550a-4436-aa73-eb5ade6094ed","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["CyberLink Power2Go doesn’t provide the full battery of ripping features we look for in a DVD ripper.
