You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The TP-Link RE580D is a Wi-Fi booster with three dual-band antennas capable of moving data at speeds up to 1.9 Gbps. In addition, it has a dual-core processor to help process data quickly. All in all, it’s designed to overcome the performance limitations of Wi-Fi range extenders. However, tests suggest that it’s not as fast as the specifications suggest.","Our colleagues at Tom’s Guide thoroughly tested the RE580D’s range extension and data throughput – the speed at which it moves data back and forth over the wireless network. They also evaluated the setup. Overall, the RE580D was good, but not great.","In the range extension tests, it extended the wireless network by 125 feet, which was middling in comparison to the other <a href=\"/best-wi-fi-boosters\">Wi-Fi boosters</a>. Still, it’s a significant boost. You shouldn’t have a problem blanketing a large house with this extender and filling in dead spots. That said, the best Wi-Fi booster for large homes extended the wireless range by 165 feet.","The throughput tested at an average of 327.7 Mbps, which was also middling. The fastest Wi-Fi extender, the <a href=\"/netgear-nighthawk-review\">Netgear Nighthawk EX7000</a>, had a throughput of 413.8 Mbps in the same tests, which is significantly faster despite having similar specifications. Both are dual band, pushing data over the 2.4 and 5GHz frequencies, and both have dual-core processors for optimized performance. When you consider that both cost about the same, it’s clear which extender has the better value for a large house.","At 9.5 x 7.8 x 1.8 inches, the TP-Link RE580D is one of the biggest Wi-Fi boosters on the market. For many people, this isn’t an issue, but if you’re short on desk space or shelf space, then the size might be something to consider. That said, it does have wall-mounting capabilities.","The antennas are adjustable, which allows you to rotate and angle them for the best coverage possible. The back of the device has five Ethernet ports, which is ideal for connecting wired devices like printers and gaming consoles.","The setup is among the easiest for a Wi-Fi extender of this caliber. It took the tester just four minutes to set up. In addition, you can set up the 2.4 and 5GHz bands at the same time. After that, it’s as simple as customizing the network name and password.","For a large home with dead spots, the TP-Link RE580D is a good option. It’s just not the best option. It shouldn’t have any problem blanketing your dead spots with a wireless signal and it should provide you with enough speed, but it doesn’t compare to the best Wi-Fi range extender on the market."]},"id":"b2ade752-f3b1-478e-9245-bd17825a2469","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60902","url":"/tp-link-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-22T17:56:27Z","datePublished":"2014-10-22T17:56:27Z","name":"TP-Link RE580D AC1900","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":28,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-10-22T17:56:27Z","id":"Et5av7ixvnBnL5FgXCVYfF","meta":{"title":"TP-Link RE580D AC1900 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The TP-Link RE580D is a dual-band Wi-Fi range extender with speeds up to 1.9 Gbps.
