These headphones block out noises like loud traffic, airplane engines and the raucous typing fingers of your coworkers. The best ones enhance your listening experience by doing more than just cancelling noise. Some benefits include better ear health, as you won’t have to play music at high volumes to drown out noise; better sleep quality and less fatigue, especially if you snooze in public while traveling; and improved emotional well-being, as extraneous noises, particularly those in low frequencies, are scientifically proven to be detrimental to your mood.","<strong>How We Tested Noise-Cancelling Headphones       </strong>","Specs tell you very little about how well a particular pair of headphones works or sounds. We tested all the headphones we reviewed in our lab’s sound-proof studio to get a better idea of their quality. A group of expert reviewers, including a film maker, rock musician, audiophile and others, listened to each pair and assessed overall quality and noise-cancelling ability. "]},"id":"6582ddc2-2d1f-4863-9109-4f2bb51d22e0","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/AfePG77FUrQWTk7Ad9qidb.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/ttr/comparison/564/SIA%20image_02_Edited.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AfePG77FUrQWTk7Ad9qidb.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"AfePG77FUrQWTk7Ad9qidb","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AfePG77FUrQWTk7Ad9qidb.jpg","alt":""},"id":"76889e16-632b-4263-8c25-ec1c1e4e3a00","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Noise-Cancelling Test  </strong>","Headphone manufacturers are very reluctant to post noise-reduction ratings.

We played them a playlist comprised of music from a variety of genres. They listened for deep bass and crisp trebles, then scored the headphones for overall performance. If the bass wasn’t sturdy enough in a Beastie Boys song, the headphones scored low. If the overall sound was detailed and textured in a Jonny Cash recording, they scored high. We paid particular attention to how ANC affected sound quality – you can often hear a slight buzzing or white noise, and it can be disruptive between songs or in quiet melodies.","As we listened for differences in sound quality between Bluetooth and wired connections, as well as active and passive noise-cancelling, we found very little variance. This is a surprising testament to how far Bluetooth has advanced the last few years. However, we did notice a volume uptick with ANC turned on versus when it was turned off, which can be annoying when you switch back and forth. ","The best wireless noise-cancelling headphones for overall sound quality are the Sony MDR-1000X, as the soundscape is balanced and has great bass, and you can’t hear the common buzz when ANC is turned on.

Longer-lasting headphones, such as the Sony h.ear on Wireless NC, which lasted over 26 hours, are much better suited to travel and commuting as well as for those of us who have too many devices to charge already.","<strong>Comfort Test</strong>","If a pair of headphones sound great and work great but don’t feel great, you’re not going to enjoy them. Part of the noise-cancelling headphone experience is drowning out the world around you, and you can’t do that with a headband-induced splitting headache.

Their larger ear cups do help isolate noise, and wearing them around town or while traveling is extremely convenient because they’re wireless.

The in-ear design helps block some noise, and in many cases, they’re much cheaper than over-ear headphones.

That way, you won’t have to deal with a dongle or tangles and cords.","<strong>Weight &amp; Design</strong><br/>Don’t pick a pair of headphones that weighs more than 12 ounces – they’ll hurt after just a few minutes of playback. Also, keep in mind cord length and consider whether you need an on-ear or inline remote. How and where you plan to use your headphones plays a big role in determining which are best for you. Different design elements matter more than others depending on if you will primarily use them on a plane, on a train or in the back of the campus library. Keep your listening environment in mind to help you choose headphones with design features that best allow you to listen to your music or audiobook for hours on end."]},"id":"06b4351e-abe4-4c93-ad57-e35872fc8a75","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"387c96a3-0802-4f09-bdfb-f28b272afe26","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KHZ4ZYY/?&tag=ttr-noise-cancelling-headphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|564[art|NA[pid|69118[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sony MDR-1000X</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MYAC300/?&tag=ttr-noise-cancelling-headphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|564[art|NA[pid|69119[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sennheiser HD 1 Wireless</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E3SNO1G/?&tag=ttr-noise-cancelling-headphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|564[art|NA[pid|50028[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Bose QuietComfort 35</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CQXGM5K/?&tag=ttr-noise-cancelling-headphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|564[art|NA[pid|69121[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sony h.ear on Wireless NC</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MCRVPO6/?&tag=ttr-noise-cancelling-headphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|564[art|NA[pid|69122[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Plantronics BackBeat</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VW7U8X4/?&tag=ttr-noise-cancelling-headphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|564[art|NA[pid|69120[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Bose QuietComfort 25</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TTD7VO/?&tag=ttr-noise-cancelling-headphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|564[art|NA[pid|69123[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">PSB M4U 2</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HWJT1A/?&tag=ttr-noise-cancelling-headphones&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|564[art|NA[pid|50027[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Audio Technica ATH-ANC7b</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007KWLF5K/?&tag=ttr-noise-cancelling-headphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|564[art|NA[pid|69124[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Audio-Technica ATH-ANC9</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016Y37M4I/?&tag=ttr-noise-cancelling-headphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|564[art|NA[pid|57803[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Parrot Zik 3</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HMZRE2I/?&tag=ttr-noise-cancelling-headphones-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|564[art|NA[pid|53876[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Beats Studio Wireless</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"6cc2d579-7670-436f-afe5-7425384f1fef","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_564","url":"/best-noise-cancelling-headphones","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"bethany-gordon","url":"/author/bethany-gordon","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Bethany Gordon","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"tegXFQJXWkzcKPbfwtRhn7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-07-09T13:46:27Z","datePublished":"2017-03-28T01:13:03Z","name":"Noise-Cancelling Headphones Review","synopsis":"Noise-cancelling headphones actively block outside noises so they don’t interfere with your music, audiobooks and movies.
