But, we know what it can be like to hunt around for the right edition online or to waiting around for your books to arrive while your professor keeps assigning readings to the whole class. We looked for online textbook rental companies that understand these pressures and get your books to you quickly while letting you have control of when and how you return them without incurring additional fees.","We regularly update this site with the newest information about what’s new in the online textbook rental world.  We spend our days reading website FAQs and return policies so that you can find the best online textbook rental options for your needs. ","<strong>How We Tested<br/></strong>First, we researched to find the best textbook companies by looking at their online offerings, rental and buying options, their return policies and support centers. We looked to see if their online sites were up-to-date, had secure payment options and were intuitive to use.  We were particularly interested in eBook offerings from each site because it seems like an inexpensive way to get your hands on your textbooks.","We looked to see what kind of textbook selection the companies offer and how many they keep on their sites. We also wanted to know the company’s policies about textbook return and in what condition the book needs to be to be returned in to avoid additional fees after using it for a semester or block class. We favored companies with more lenient policies and more flexible return times. ","After researching a ton of textbook rentals, we chose to test eight different companies. We ordered the same textbook from every online textbook company we tested, a copy of Alan Strahler’s <em>Introducing Physical Geography</em>. We tracked the shipping to make sure that it arrived within the services’ estimated window. Then, we looked at the shipping materials that the service provided. Finally, we evaluated how easy it was to return each of these books to close out our accounts.","<strong>How Much Does Renting Textbooks Cost?</strong>","Depending on major, a typical college student can spend up to $1,200 a year on textbooks. Renting can save you more than 50 percent, and sometimes up to 70 percent, of the typical cost. If your major requires expensive textbooks, renting can save you quite a bit of money. Depending on the company you choose, you may have to pay shipping, late fees and fees for any damage that occurs to the books you rent.","<strong>What Key Features to Look for When Renting or Buying Textbooks </strong>","Rental options<br/>Choose a company that offers rental periods that work with your school schedule so you can avoid having to send your textbook back a week before finals. While most companies offer extensions, you’ll want to find out what kinds of additional fees they charge and how much longer you can get each title.","You’ll also want to see if you can get e-text versions of the book in addition to or instead of a physical copy. E-textbooks can be delivered to your device instantly, and you don’t have to worry about sending them back.","Returns<br/>We evaluated the convenience of returns to each company based on the packaging and included instructions. But you’ll probably just want to keep an eye out for the return policy information. Having a company that sends you notifications and reminders about when the item is due helps you to avoid late fees.","You might also want to check to see what kind of return conditions the company places on the textbooks they rent out. Some companies let you annotate and highlight, while others don’t let you make marks of any kind, but keep an eye out for what’s right for you so that you’re not surprised. ","<strong>Watch Out for Late Fees When Renting Textbooks</strong>","According to the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whats-behind-the-soaring-cost-of-college-textbooks/\">College Board</a>, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks, and prices continue to rise. You can save between 50 and 90 percent by renting a textbook instead of buying it. However, keep in mind that late fees can be quite high.","To avoid late fees, return your textbooks by the due date. Fortunately, most rental companies send you email notifications as the due date approaches. You can also extend your rental for a fee, usually a percentage of your initial rental cost. ","Extensions vary in length. For example, Chegg allows you to extend rentals for 10 days and Amazon gives you 15 days, while Bookbyte lets you choose a 15-, 30- and 150-day extension. Some companies trigger this extension automatically if the book isn’t returned on time. To extend, Chegg charges 25 percent of the rental cost, plus applicable taxes. Amazon’s and Bookbyte’s extension fees vary depending on the book you rent. ","Failure to return a book results in late fees – most often, you pay full price for the book. When this happens, the company charges you the book’s price minus the rental fee. Some rental companies, including Bookbyte, charge a default fee of $10 or more. ","If you send your book before the rental period ends and still get charged because the company hasn’t received it yet, the late fee will be refunded. Usually, the company gives you a seven- to 10-day grace period between when the rental ends and when it receives the book back."]},"id":"ebbff2bc-6207-4c24-806b-4b9c0c7c863d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_171","url":"/best-textbook-rentals-online","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-16T18:57:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-16T18:57:00Z","name":"Best Textbook Rentals Online of 2019","synopsis":"We tested seven of the biggest textbook rental services, judging them based on their flexibility, book delivery, and return processes.","review":{},"strapline":"We tested seven of the biggest textbook rental services, judging them based on their flexibility, book delivery, and return processes.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-25T17:04:29Z","id":"pQzBeAbp39U3v8YTJrsPUT","meta":{"title":"Best Textbook Rental Sites 2019 - Online Book Rental Reviews","description":"We tested seven of the biggest textbook rental services, judging them based on their flexibility, book delivery, and return processes."},"products":[{"slug":"chegg","url":"/product/chegg","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","name":"Chegg","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","id":"uZoeiR5YLmqj6scG8ntSwA","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"amazon","url":"/product/amazon","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","name":"Amazon","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","id":"ZZcTtWXWVwZL7KKnnPTZ5e","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"bookbyte","url":"/product/bookbyte","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","name":"Bookbyte","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","id":"yFhjToskdjoG9bqn7ByQ8h","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"iflipd","url":"/product/iflipd","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","name":"iFlipd","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","id":"AxZUNZqekT8MEA3qTRRcDY","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"barnes-and-noble","url":"/product/barnes-and-noble","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","name":"Barnes & Noble","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","id":"HeEbrRNPaNHqqZVpYBswSJ","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","type":"best-pick","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/bzyWPXxCcqNDDk9pPTvhaC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Textbook-Rentals-Online-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/K/B/793883/original/Hero-Textbook-Rentals-Online-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","id":"bzyWPXxCcqNDDk9pPTvhaC","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bzyWPXxCcqNDDk9pPTvhaC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Textbook Rentals Online of 2019","description":"We tested seven of the biggest textbook rental services, judging them based on their flexibility, book delivery, and return processes."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/bzyWPXxCcqNDDk9pPTvhaC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","mimeType":"","name":"Hero-Textbook-Rentals-Online-1a.jpg","importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/K/B/793883/original/Hero-Textbook-Rentals-Online-1a.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","id":"bzyWPXxCcqNDDk9pPTvhaC","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bzyWPXxCcqNDDk9pPTvhaC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Best Textbook Rentals Online of 2019","description":"We tested seven of the biggest textbook rental services, judging them based on their flexibility, book delivery, and return processes."}},"site":"toptenreviews","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"hobbies","url":"/hobbies","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","name":"Hobbies","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","id":"SLWtPZ5uLEkqGkC6GTMbuB","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"online-learning","url":"/hobbies/online-learning","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","name":"Online Learning","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:21Z","id":"XPnBFKPoDXvrQjJgxP3Jdk","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
