This drawing program can create flash animations and web graphics, as well as edit raster images and create vector illustrations. Zoner Draw also has specific tools to make technical drawings, such as maps, blueprints, floor plans and diagrams.","We are impressed with the templates Zoner Draw includes in its drawing software. The software organizes templates into various categories, including albums, cards, CD labels, flyers, greetings, invitations, menus and tags. These templates are valuable because not only do they help you to quickly complete projects, but the templates also give you ideas on what you can create with drawing software. For example, you can use the Tag template to quickly make a variety of personalized tags for Christmas or birthday presents – an added touch that you may not have considered before perusing the templates in Zoner Draw.","This drawing software has several unique quick shapes, including some artistic polygon shapes that resemble flowers, clovers or starfish. The quick shapes also include a bar code option. After placing a bar code, you can choose among 23 different bar codes and enter in the data, or numbers, to display underneath the bar code. The bar code option reinforces that Zoner Draw has the capabilities to create technical and professional drawings. In fact, Zoner Draw is the only drawing software we&#39;ve come across that has the feature to easily create bar codes. If this is a function you can frequently use, you may want to seriously consider Zoner Draw.","Zoner Draw also has some other clever functions that we’d like to point out. There are several zoom options – more than we have seen on other drawing software applications – which are available on the toolbars. First, Zoner Draw has the traditional zoom in and out options. In addition to those, you can choose previous zoom, zoom to object, zoom to selected and zoom to pasteboard to see their project from an assortment of views.","Also available on the toolbar is a feature that allows you to customize the corners of each object. You can round corners, cut corners or just use normal corners. This simple feature lets you quickly create different effects for shapes and create the exact look you are searching for. Another feature we appreciate is the duplicate mode. Instead of copying an object and repeatedly pressing the Control-V command to create several copies of an object, you can highlight an object and place it in duplicate mode just by pushing a button. After this, you can pull as many identical objects as you like out of the original object. This easy function helps you to create your illustrations faster and more efficiently.","Unfortunately, Zoner Draw is missing some features we consider important. Although this drawing software includes a pen tool, there is no brush tool, which is a standard feature in drawing software. Clip art and filters used to create vector and raster effects are also missing. These two features are easily accessible though. You can download clip art from the internet straight into Zoner Draw’s clip art side panel. Also, Zoner Draw is set up to support plug-ins, specifically so you can download and use Adobe’s filter effects."]},"id":"a37a4051-c4f9-4e41-9644-e861301ebf2c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"64c702c2-73f6-4da3-ac1d-100533fe8af2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Zoner Draw has excellent file compatibility.
