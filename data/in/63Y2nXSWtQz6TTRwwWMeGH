You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Dynex has created a respectable web cam that is well designed and functional. The Dynex 1.3MP Webcam<strong> </strong>doesn’t have all the extra features and tools that you will find in the higher-end models, but it has everything you need for recording video, taking pictures and web chatting. We found through our research that users were very pleased with the quality and the performance. The reason this product is ranked lower than our top-rated <a href=\"/best-webcams\">web cameras</a> is because although it provides decent quality, there is higher quality available. It also provides adequate features and tools, but again there are other web cameras that have more. This is a fine camera and we have nothing against it, but if you&#39;re looking for high quality and powerful features that will give you the most vivid, clear picture, we recommend you look at the Logitech HD Webcam C510, the HP Webcam HD-3110 and the Microsoft LifeCam Cinema Webcam.","The Dynex 1.3MP Webcam provides users with some great features including a built-in microphone, face tracking and a feature for capturing screenshots. The product provides users with 1.3 MP of resolution for still images and up to 5.0MP for interpolated images. The video quality will reach 1280x1024p resolution, which is at least decent quality. The camera can be used with video chat applications and is compatible with Windows and Mac computers.","The Dynex 1.3MP Webcam is a USB web camera that connects both the built-in microphone and the camera with a single USB cable. For optimum speed and quality a USB 2.0 port is recommended. We found that the product clips snuggly to a computer monitor and doesn’t move unnecessarily. Although the camera cannot rotate the full 360-degrees to capture an entire view of any specific area, it is equipped with face-tracking technology. The web cam will follow your face, if you stay within the designated range of the camera.","We found the installation process fast and simple. We were able to have our web camera up and running in less than 30 minutes. The features and tools were easy to access and use with any of the programs we opted to use it with. The snapshot button was fun but also came in handy for screenshots that we opted to capture and save for future reference.","Dynex provides their users with a one-year limited warranty and unlimited customer support. Through the Dynex website you can find warranty information, a quick setup guide, drivers, firmware and software in addition to their toll-free phone number and email address. We found that the Dynex customer service representatives were quick to respond to our questions and knowledgeable about their products."]},"id":"12c41abb-8076-4e43-a840-d64399da0985","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"698bc243-6b83-48c8-a756-22003d69170c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We were happy with the results we found while testing the Dynex 1.3MP Webcam.
