Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product, the Chamberlain C410. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Chamberlain PD762EV 3/4-horsepower chain-driven opener is reliable, quiet and significantly stronger than 1/2-horsepower models. Its safety features, lifting capability and durability make it one of the best <a href=\"/best-garage-door-openers\">garage door openers</a> available.","This garage door opener is solidly built and can handle most double-wide doors, including heavier ones with a fair amount of decorative wood. The 3/4-horsepower motor can lift doors up to 550 pounds with ease. Although, if your door is taller than 7 feet, you need to purchase an 8- or 10-foot rail extension kit so there is enough room for your door to open completely.","This garage opener is compatible with the MyQ home automation system. Using a home automation system allows you to turn on lights, open doors and perform other functions from your smartphone.","This opener offers peace of mind when it comes to both safety and security. Chamberlain helps keep criminals away with a rolling code system that resets every time you open your garage door. If you lose a remote and suspect that it has fallen into the wrong hands, you can deactivate your remotes by using the lock function until the missing remote has turned up again.","A motion detection feature built into the control panel turns on the garage door lights anytime you enter the garage. In addition, the lights remain on for four and a half minutes before automatically turning off, which is plenty of time to get into your home. It is always inconvenient to have the lights turn off while you are struggling to get kids, groceries or pets into the house. With the motion sensor, you don&#39;t have to worry about that.","As an additional safety feature, this garage door opener is designed to reverse and lift if anything gets in the way of the infrared light beam constantly projected across the bottom of the doorway. Sensory technology also causes the door to automatically go back up if it comes in contact with anything on its way down.","This model lacks a keyless entry pad. If you need one, consider our top pick - <a href=\"/chamberlain-premium-whisper-drive-review\">Chamberlain Premium Whisper Drive</a>.","This garage door opener includes many easy-to-use components that allow you to enjoy your opener, including a lighted console and two 3-button remotes. With two 100-watt bulbs brightening your garage, you should be able to navigate to your door with clear vision. The control panel has three buttons: a button for locking the door, another to turn on the lights manually and an oversized button to lift or close the door. The oversized button is a nice feature, especially if you frequently have your hands full while you enter your home. This model does not include a keyless entry pad, so you need to purchase one if you want to have access from outside without a remote.","The Chamberlain comes with a lifetime warranty on the motor and a one-year warranty on parts. The parts warranty includes the chain and the railing system. The best garage door openers have lifetime warranties on parts as well.","Chamberlain customer service representatives are responsive and friendly, and you can reach them by phone and email. The Chamberlain website is organized and useful. You can find a downloadable manual if you happen to lose yours and need to know how to program a new remote or order a part."]},"id":"4cb1944c-9085-4155-99ac-3511c8cecee7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6e87e314-817d-49f4-8200-a69fe0e4ce56","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Chamberlain produces excellent garage door openers, and the 3/4-horsepower PD762EV stands out with an impressive amount of horsepower and a lifetime motor warranty.
