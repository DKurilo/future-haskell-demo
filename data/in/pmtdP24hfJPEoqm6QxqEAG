You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</i>","The HP Compaq L2206tm <a href=\"/best-touchscreen-monitors\">touchscreen monitor</a> has HD resolution, a high contrast ratio and more optical sensors than other optical touchscreens we reviewed. However, HP hasn&#39;t designed this monitor&#39;s stand for touchscreen use. It sits several inches above the table and doesn&#39;t recline much, making it impractical to use. Additionally, although the viewing angles may fit the needs of a standard monitor position, if you reclined the screen sufficiently for an ergonomic position, the viewing angle may affect the picture quality.","This LCD touchscreen uses LED backlighting, which increases its ability to display true black. Additionally, the HP computer monitor has a 1000:1 contrast ratio, which is the same ratio as most of the other monitors we reviewed. The contrast ratio measures how true black appears and how brilliant white seems on the screen. The pixel pitch, or space between the pixels, is average for the screen size and resolution.","The response time for this monitor is 5ms, which is more than adequate. Additionally, the aspect ratio for the screen&#39;s 1920 x 1080 resolution is a standard 16:9. The brightness of this HP computer monitor is only 220 candelas per meter squared, which isn&#39;t as high as we would like it to be.","When you use a touchscreen monitor, the user experience is different from that of a standard monitor. Instead of having the monitor out in front of you in a nearly vertical position, you&#39;ll want the monitor to be in a much more reclined position. Otherwise, you&#39;ll be holding your arms out in front of you instead of in a rested position. This screen adjusts between 30 and -5 degrees, which isn&#39;t that helpful. Additionally, the stand holds the screen several inches above the desk, making it less ergonomic.","The viewing angle is another spec that is more crucial for a touchscreen. You&#39;ll probably use the monitor with the screen reclined away from you, so you&#39;ll want a viewing angle that&#39;s as wide as possible so you can still experience great picture quality. This monitor has a 170-degree horizontal viewing angle but a 160-degree vertical viewing angle. The vertical viewing angle in this case is probably the angle you&#39;d want to be wider. Other LCD touchscreens we reviewed have wider viewing angles.","HP uses optical touchscreen technology with three sensors instead of the typical two. This means that the screen will effectively identify where you touch the screen. Additionally, you can touch the screen in two places simultaneously and the HP touchscreen monitor will register both touches. Two touch points is typical for touchscreens; however, some monitors have many more simultaneous touch points."]},"id":"91446fff-5bd3-4b2b-b9b8-f98dcb95f61e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6875d57f-897b-4218-888b-81581b93c06f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Compaq L2206tm touchscreen monitor is a two-touch-point monitor with three optical sensors.
