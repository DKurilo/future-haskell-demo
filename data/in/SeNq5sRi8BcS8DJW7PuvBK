You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Most of the best <a href=\"/best-sound-bars\">sound bars</a>  we compare attempt to simulate surround sound, but the Energy Power Bar instead strives to improve the audio generated from two channels. If you are looking to enjoy the effects of simulated surround sound, you need to look elsewhere.","You are able to place the Power Bar on a TV stand, or you can mount the unit on your wall using the two keyhole mounts located on the back of the speaker bar. Installing the Energy Power Bar is quite easy, requiring only a few minutes of your time. In fact, the sound bar and subwoofer will be up and running in under 10 minutes.","The front of this sound bar features a control panel allowing you to power the unit on, switch between sources, mute the audio and adjust the volume. Operating the speaker bar remotely requires you to program your own remote control. If you happen to own a Samsung TV, you are in luck. The Energy Power Bar is pre-programmed to work with many Samsung televisions.","So how does the Energy Power Bar sound? The sound generated from the 100-watt speaker bar is clear and loud, particularly given its small  size and relative affordability. Vocals and dialogue are generally nice and clear.","The 15-pound wireless subwoofer is light enough to be moved easily from one corner of your room to the other. While the subwoofer&#39;s fiber composite, eight-inch driver produces respectable bass, it isn&#39;t as deep nor as full as the bass we experienced in many of the sound bars featured in our sound bar reviews.","On the rear of the Energy Power Bar sound bar, you will find one RCA input and one optical input. That is it. There is no sign of HMDI support or Bluetooth connectivity. You will find the severe lack of inputs and connectivity options disappointing, especially if you plan on hooking up several digital audio and video components.","You may contact customer support via telephone and email. There is also a product FAQs and a glossary of terms that you may find helpful. Your Energy Power Bar comes backed by a one-year warranty.","While the Energy Power Bar sounds loud and clear, the lack of surround sound emulation, sparse connectivity and mediocre bass output prevent this speaker one of the best sound bars  in our lineup."]},"id":"0f22a1e0-dcef-49e1-833a-26dc1501e6c3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_54622","url":"/energy-power-bar-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-04-20T20:11:15Z","datePublished":"2012-04-20T20:11:15Z","name":"Energy Power Bar","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"verdict":"The sound bar&#039;s loud and clear sound is overshadowed by poor connectivity options and lack of surround sound effects.","pros":["The Energy Power Bar is simple to set up and install.
