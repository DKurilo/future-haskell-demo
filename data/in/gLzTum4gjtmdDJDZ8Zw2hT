It can operate on a standard return line and does not require the power of a separate booster pump. The four-wheel design ensures that it does not tip while cleaning, while dual thrust jets push debris up from the surface of the pool.","A large-capacity filter bag captures dirt, leaves and other contaminants, lessening the wear and tear on your pool’s filter. The vacuum features an extra-large intake valve for big chunks of debris like leaves and twigs. An automated backup design automatically fires every 3.5 minutes so that the vacuum doesn’t get stuck in any corner of the pool while it’s cleaning. This cleaner’s sister product – the <a href=\"/kreepy-krauly-platinum-review\">Kreepy Krauly Platinum</a> – is also designed for efficient cleaning. It has dual-thrust jets that allow for fast cleaning and front-wheel drive for extra traction.","Front-wheel traction helps pull the vacuum up steep surfaces and sidewalls. It can clean concrete, fiberglass and vinyl surfaces. Because a booster pump is not required, it may utilize less energy than more powerful pressure pool cleaners. The rear sweep hose helps loosen small debris like silt and algae to be vacuumed up by the cleaner efficiently.","Note that booster pumps do supply more power, so this cleaner may be slower than larger models. Be prepared to empty the filter bag often for optimal performance, and the rear sweep hose may be bit heavy for a cleaner that operates at a lower pressure. This cleaner is lightweight and as such, may get caught up in the hose. While it’s an automated cleaner, you may need to check on its progress to ensure that it’s not getting tangled or caught on your pool’s steps or other nooks.","This is one of few pressure pool cleaners that don’t require an external booster pump. Less equipment typically means less maintenance. It is made by a reputable manufacturer and offers a familiar stable of features and options. It should do an adequate job of keeping a small to midsize pool free of silt and debris, and it could also help lessen wear and tear on your pool’s filtration system."]},"id":"992a5c8a-03d1-44bb-ae8d-d0a6f31c2cd4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66570","url":"/kreepy-krauly-legend-ii-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-14T18:30:52Z","datePublished":"2015-08-14T18:30:52Z","name":"Kreepy Krauly Legend II","synopsis":"Pentair’s Kreepy Krauly line of pool cleaners offer a complete range of options for both in-ground and above-ground pools, and the Legend II Cleaner is the company’s only model that doesn&","review":{"rating":92,"verdict":"The Kreepy Krauly Legend II is very capable and has extra power for cleaning.","pros":["The automated backup feature fires regularly to prevent it from getting stuck."],"cons":["Its included hose is the shortest of any in our comparison."]},"strapline":"Pentair’s Kreepy Krauly line of pool cleaners offer a complete range of options for both in-ground and above-ground pools, and the Legend II Cleaner is the company’s only model that doesn&","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-04-05T00:00:00Z","id":"gLzTum4gjtmdDJDZ8Zw2hT","meta":{"title":"Kreepy Krauly Legend II Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Kreepy Krauly Legend II is very capable and has extra power for cleaning."},"products":[{"slug":"kreepy-krauly-legend-ii","url":"/product/kreepy-krauly-legend-ii","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:28:40Z","name":"Kreepy Krauly Legend II","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:28:40Z","id":"SnTnokjaUugARGDzXNBm2B","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:28:41Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ggcykQyVF68UnRUhgNPgUV.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:28:40Z","mimeType":"","name":"9056a6dbf724ff998abae060de80ffef.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/9056a6dbf724ff998abae060de80ffef.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:28:40Z","id":"ggcykQyVF68UnRUhgNPgUV","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ggcykQyVF68UnRUhgNPgUV.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Kreepy Krauly Legend II Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Kreepy Krauly Legend II is very capable and has extra power for cleaning."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ggcykQyVF68UnRUhgNPgUV.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:28:40Z","mimeType":"","name":"9056a6dbf724ff998abae060de80ffef.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/9056a6dbf724ff998abae060de80ffef.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:28:40Z","id":"ggcykQyVF68UnRUhgNPgUV","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ggcykQyVF68UnRUhgNPgUV.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Kreepy Krauly Legend II Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Kreepy Krauly Legend II is very capable and has extra power for cleaning."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/outdoor/best-pressure-pool-cleaners/kreepy-krauly-legend-ii-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:28:40Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:28:40Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"pool-and-hot-tub","url":"/home-and-garden/pool-and-hot-tub","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:28:40Z","name":"Pool & Hot Tub","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:28:40Z","id":"Snsyvysc6JMsPB5BLBFHBh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
