The classic sand-filled ant farm kits are still available and selling nicely, although they sometimes take a back seat to the snazzy gel-filled models that look so glamorous. No matter which style you select, an ant farm can teach children about ecosystems, animal habitats and science in a way that keeps them fascinated.","Ants will keep adults interested as well as children because the ants are quite active: they dig tunnels, build bridges, consume food and liquids, remove waste from their living areas to a spot they designate for trash, and much more.

The amount of interaction and responsibility that comes with an ant farm will differ by each model. The sand-filled ant farms â€“ the more traditional ant habitats â€“ will certainly require more interaction and responsibility than a gel-filled station. The sand provides no nutrients or water for the ants so it is crucial that you provide it for them. However, even if you have to feed and water the ants, you will not provide them food every single day. You will give your ants just two or three drops of water as well as small crumbs of fruits, vegetables or even bread every two or three days. Many company websites provide additional information on the care and time it takes to take care of these more traditional ant habitats. The type of ant you place in the ant farm may also have different food and water requirements.","If you choose a gel-filled model, you will have to do very little aside from setting up the ant farm and helping your ants start their tunnels. The gel you place in the habitat provides water and food for the ants so you donâ€™t have to feed them or take care of them. In many ant farms, the gel was created as a joint project with high school students and students at Syracuse University. It was actually used for ants that were aboard NASAâ€™s space shuttle Columbia. The gel-filled stations have become a popular option as it still provides some learning yet little responsibility and typically features a more unique and exciting design.","<strong>How Do I Find the Right Ants for the Ant Habitat?</strong>","Most products recommend using Harvester Ants in your ant farm. Harvester Ants are ants that gather and store food in a colony. They are also larger than other species of ants so it is harder for them to escape from some ant farm models. Although, if you wish to catch your own ants, look at different models and their instructions as some products say catching your own ants and placing them in the ant farm should not be a problem. If you catch your own ants, it is recommended to place the ants in the refrigerator for a short time before placing them in the ant farm. The cold temperature slows the ants down and makes it easier to place them in the ant habitat without them scurrying away.","Many products include a certificate that you can redeem for a certain number of Harvester Ants, such as 25 or 50, free of charge. For other companies, you may need to find a third-party company that distributes ants and purchase the ants online or by telephone. If you order the ants online, you must expect delays with your shipment. If the weather is either too hot or too cold, the company may delay shipping your product to ensure the ants arrive alive. Many companies provide a guarantee that your ants will arrive on time but you must comply with the possible delayed shipping. You will want to look at all third-party companies and their shipping policies before spending too much money on ants that could arrive dead on your doorstep."]},"id":"dab254a5-a97d-4ca4-845b-24226af4b8d9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ant Farms: What to Look For"},"id":"1d8fc53d-ca88-44c4-9722-a66fce73b115","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Ant farms come in handy for teachers when the curriculum calls for studying living things and their habitats.
