The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about</em><i> </i><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/money/debt/best-credit-repair-services/\"><em>Credit Repair Services</em></a><i> </i><em>here.</em>","180 Credit Solutions offers credit repair to clients for an average period of two to three months. It doesn&#39;t offer many of the program features some of the best services provide, but it does advertise a relatively high credit score increase of up to 260 points. Remember that your results may vary depending on your credit situation.","We reached out to 180 Credit Solutions multiple times across different days and times via telephone. Though a phone number is listed on its website, we were never able to get ahold of a representative on the phone. However, this company was responsive to our email inquiries and answered our questions via email.","There are some supplemental educational resources available through 180 Credit Solutions. At the time of this review, this company has six topics available on its website for you to learn more about credit and finances. However, it does not have an educational blog as some other services do.","To work with 180 Credit Solutions, you must pay a monthly service fee. The cost of this fee varies depending on your credit situation, as does the setup fee. If you sign up for credit repair service with a partner, you and your partner both receive a $50 discount on your first payment. This company does not pull your credit report for you, so you don&#39;t need to worry about a pull credit report fee. However, you&#39;ll have to pull your own credit report. 180 Credit Solutions offers a money-back guarantee if its service doesn&#39;t work for you.","This credit repair company claims that its clients see a 90 to 260 credit score increase on average. Keep in mind that your actual results may vary, and that this company, as with all credit repair companies, can only remove inaccurate hits to your credit, which includes items that the bureaus and creditors can&#39;t prove are true.","The average client works with 180 Credit Solutions for two to three months, though the time you spend with this company may be shorter or longer depending on how many items you need to dispute on your report and how long it takes for the bureaus and creditors to respond to the disputations. You should expect to start seeing results in 30 to 45 days.","This company disputes all of the negative items on your credit report at once, which makes it appealing for fast credit repair. However, some industry experts claim that disputing all of your negative items at once makes it less likely that the bureaus will take your claims seriously, and that it may be more effective to work through your credit report in smaller batches.","180 Credit Solutions works with your creditors as well as the three major credit bureaus. This is helpful because if the creditors are part of the removal process, it&#39;s more likely that the items removed from your credit report won&#39;t be added back on later. This company also offers monthly credit monitoring. However, it does not offer <a href=\"/best-identity-theft-protection-services\">identity theft protection</a> or pay for delete negotiations. Additionally, you must sign a contract when you work with 180 Credit Solutions. This means that you cannot cancel your service without penalty; you must follow the contract through to its conclusion."]},"id":"3beaa0f7-a66d-49c0-a2c9-2d5753138bed","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b5c01ea6-bbd2-411d-9209-ccd15a26a72d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["180 Credit Solutions advertises high credit score increases over a short period of time.
