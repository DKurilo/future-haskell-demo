Despite the limitations of its motor it can still grind sizable quantities of meat with little effort. The device comes with all the necessary attachments for creating a variety of grinds; however, it still has limitations to the toughness of meat it can handle. This, combined with one of the shortest warranty periods in our comparison prevent this device from ranking higher.","This home meat grinder comes with a motor rated to perform at 350 watts. It operates at 0.5 horsepower due to the wattage restriction, reaching 250 watts of output power while under load and grinding meat. This does little to impact performance, however, as it can grind up to 1.5 pounds of meat per minute, up to a maximum of 100 pounds of meat in an hour. The output level is achievable for each of its three grinding plates, as well as the sausage and kibbe attachments.","The warranty is a critical component of the food grinders in our comparison, which is where this unit falls short. As opposed to the industry standard of a year, this device is only protected for the first 30 days, after which you must purchase and pay for any repairs to the unit in the event of product failure. Despite this, you can expect extended levels of performance anywhere from an hour to nearly three hours without the unit overheating. Fat buildups within the main hopper and screw can impact performance during such prolonged grinds, so you’ll want to make sure the meat waiting in reserve is properly stored and kept cool. Under such circumstances, you won’t have to stop and clean the grinder of fat and grease buildups as frequently.","If a longer warranty is important to you, be sure to look at the <a href=\"/waring-pro-review\">Waring Pro MG855</a>, which has a five-year warranty.","A common complaint about this electric meat grinder is how quickly its cutting plates and blades can rust. After soaking and washing its individual parts, drying the unit won’t be enough to protect it from this reaction. Instead, the manufacturer recommends that each part be soaked in oil between uses so as to prevent any corrosion. Likewise, though the device is safe for use in the dishwasher, its stainless steel coating can potentially wash off or the aluminum on certain parts will warp. Such instances are rarely recorded, but it&#39;s something consumers should be aware of."]},"id":"5bcb8373-7dd9-43a6-905a-66f6539ef7cd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c781dd85-bc18-418b-8eba-ac211ecfad62","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Buffalo Tools MEG300 is a reliable stainless steel meat grinder, constrained largely by its shortened warranty period.
