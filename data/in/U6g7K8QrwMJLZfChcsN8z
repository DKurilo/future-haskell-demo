We will consider this and other products during our next site update.</em>","If you need more than just a <a href=\"/best-foot-massagers\">foot massage</a>, and need some genuine comfort for aching ankles and calves as well, the Human Touch Reflex Pro provides welcome relief as well as stimulation.","You get five levels of intensity for massages: gentle, relaxing, moderate, vigorous and intense. There also are four auto massage programs that switch among the four different speeds. The auto program modes are: relax with a gentle massage, tone with a moderate foot and calf massage, rejuvenate with a firm massage and quick-refresh, which is a five-minute medium-to-strong massage for your feet and calves.","The Human Touch Reflex Pro is designed to give your feet and the lower part of your legs a massage that applies pressure via internal rollers in a figure-eight pattern. This moves in a waving fashion from your feet up to the calves, then starts again. This circulatory massage technique is intended to move blood from your feet up to your body’s core and improve blood circulation. If you&#39;re looking for something that solely focuses on your feet you should take a look at the <a href=\"/miko-review\">Miko Shiatsu Home Foot Massager</a> instead.","This foot massager also is equipped to provide two reflexology programs that focus pressure on individual spots on the soles of your feet and heels, which many massage devotees believe helps healing in other parts of the body and improves the entire body’s equilibrium. If nothing else, your feet can feel good with this type of massage.","In addition, you get warm air circulating throughout this device, which encompasses the entire foot and ankle and extends up the calf. This can warm and relax tense muscles and give you an overall feeling of comfort.","The controls are on the top, which minimizes bending over and lets you adjust the machine to get the precise massage you want. The base can be tilted to get the right angle for your feet and legs while you sit on a favorite chair or couch.","This foot and calf massager measures 18 inches long, 17 inches wide and 19 inches high. It weighs 27 pounds and comes with a handle so you can carry it from one part of the house to the next, and it is backed by a one-year warranty. It comes in either black or taupe. The foot sleeves can be removed and washed so it stays sanitary for your feet.","This is a multi-faceted massager with a fairly steep price point. However, for anyone troubled by such things as arthritis or neuropathy, or just aching feet and calves, this could be a great value."]},"id":"dde75da8-d82a-4edd-a40f-5789a1fc45bf","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63296","url":"/human-touch-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-09T14:13:20Z","datePublished":"2015-03-09T14:13:20Z","name":"Human Touch Reflex Pro","synopsis":"Editor's Note: Human Touch now has updated models of foot and calf massagers for sale, such as the Human Touch Reflex SOL.
