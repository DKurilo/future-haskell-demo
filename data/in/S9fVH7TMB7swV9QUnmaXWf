Even with its imperfections, the curls we were finally able to create with this tool looked good and lasted a long time. Getting it to curl took a lot of effort, though.","This <a href=\"/best-curling-irons\">curling iron</a> tends to run cool, even on its highest settings, which might be a good thing if you have fine hair. Our testers with thicker hair still got it to curl, though they had to leave it in for a long time. Curling iron wands like this with a clip-free design can be nice because you do not get that tacky crease in the curl from the clip. The curling wands are harder to use, though, and they are particularly difficult to use if you have thick hair. The clip can help get and keep hair in place while it is curling. Also, with a wand most people need to use a glove in order to wrap the hair close to the barrel without getting burned. When you have to hold it in place yourself the task is a two-handed affair. Most people don&#39;t like that. Even if you are used to, or just prefer, a barrel design, this curling iron has other flaws.","The Amika took a ridiculously long time to heat up when compared to competitors, and it never reached a very high temperature, even on its highest setting, after a lot of time. The cooler temperatures would be more acceptable if it at least accurately represented them on its display. It never even came close to matching the number we got on our infrared thermometer. The actual temperature was always much lower. It is better to be too cool than too hot because heat can damage hair, but it is still frustrating to be misled about the true temperature. For decades, no curling irons indicated their temperatures so the exact temps may not be a total deal breaker. The cool temps are still annoying, though, as it takes much longer than average to get a tight curl. The range of temperatures was much smaller, too, than it was on competitors, so you can&#39;t turn it up a few clicks up in a pinch to style your hair faster. You can turn it up, but it just won&#39;t get much hotter for faster styling.","The safety features are just OK on this one. It is a wand so a glove is included. It also shuts itself off automatically so you don&#39;t have to stress if you leave in the morning and forget. There is no elevated rest, though â€“ it just sort of rolls around on the countertop. That can be dangerous."]},"id":"da14bc74-c936-4856-895e-55ccbb4a2ab2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"91743477-cbdc-4618-a39f-c7ceda554736","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Amika Digital Titanium Clip-Free Curler made some nice curls that lasted an impressively long time, but it runs much cooler than most of the competition.
