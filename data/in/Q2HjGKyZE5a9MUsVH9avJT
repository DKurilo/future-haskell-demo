It puts out a lot of power: 7,000 peak watts and 5,500 running watts. It has a 4-gallon fuel tank, which is smaller than some gasoline generators but lasts just as long or longer. Its 418 cc OHV engine offers better design qualities than a conventional piston engine. And it has five electrical outlets of various types, so you’ll be able to hook nearly anything to it. While it’s classified as a portable generator, it’s not as convenient to move around as many other generators – it is bigger, heavier and harder to transport. It’s also more expensive than gasoline or natural gas models, but it’s worth the extra cash if you want a superior generator.","This diesel <a href=\"/best-portable-generators\">portable generator</a> makes an impressive amount of electricity. At peak performance, it can generate up to 7,000 watts, which is well more than enough to provide power to a jobsite, RV or camping trip. You can even use it as a reliable backup power supply for your home. Anywhere you need power, this generator can provide it in droves.","The fuel tank on this portable generator only holds 4 gallons. This is one of the smallest tanks we encountered when we evaluated the best models on the market. However, the OHV engine on this generator offers several advantages over conventional piston engines found on gasoline and natural gas models. The bottom line is that it utilizes fuel much more efficiently. On a full tank, it lasts seven hours on a full load and 9.5 hours on a half. This is as good as or better than traditional gas-powered generators that get maximum run time on half load.","The outlets on the Pulsar 7000W will cover almost everything you need to hook up. It has two 120V outlets, like the ones in your home’s walls. It also has two twist outlets (one 120V and one 120/240V) that you use to hook up appliances, RVs and other high-powered devices.","Portable generators make a lot of noise. The Pulsar 7000W features noise reduction technology that mutes the noise to below 70 decibels. While this isn’t the quietest portable generator on the market, it shouldn’t disturb your sleep or drown out your conversations.","This is a portable generator, but it’s not as easy to transport as the other models we reviewed. It’s big, bulky, heavy and somewhat hard to load into a trunk or pickup truck. That said, it has set of durable wheels that help you roll it around.","The Pulsar 7000W is a great choice if you’re looking for a portable diesel generator. It provides plenty of power for virtually any need, uses fuel very efficiently and offers multiple outlets for you to plug your devices and appliances into. It may be a little inconvenient to move around, but once you get to your destination, you’ll be glad you brought it with you."]},"id":"0c873c4f-0279-4e5f-846b-5c1f9ff77291","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69543","url":"/pulsar-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
