DVD X Copy included a DVD decrypter engine and had the ability to decrypt DVDs then burn them to blank DVD disks. More specifically, it was able to crack the popular CSS (Content Scrambling System) encryption employed by Hollywood studios to prevent DVD copying.","Shortly after the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was passed in 1998, many software products that enabled users to copy copyrighted DVDs were sued by several major Hollywood studios, and in 2004, 321 Studios and their flagship product, DVD X Copy, was officially shut down. Although DVD X Copy is still available on the internet today, it is not supported or manufactured by 321 Studios and it has not been updated since 2004.","Here is a copy of our original review of DVD X Copy by 321 Studios.
