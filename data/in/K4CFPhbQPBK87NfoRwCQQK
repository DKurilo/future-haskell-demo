The Safety 1st Guide 65 is an affordable <a href=\"/best-baby-car-seats\">baby car seat</a> that will keep your baby secure from infancy to early childhood. It has most of the safety features we look for, but it is less usable than many of the other car seats we reviewed. Fortunately, it is lighter and smaller than most convertible car seats, so it will fit comfortably in most vehicles and will travel without much hassle.","The Guide 65 meets all federal crash safety requirements, and the seat has been on the market long enough that you can read customer testimonials about how well it performed in various collisions. The seat offers side-impact protection and is FAA compliant.","All convertible car seats offer two modes: rear-facing and front-facing positions. When you take your newborn baby home in this seat, the rear-facing position will support your child from 5 to 40 pounds. For most babies, this weight range should last until they are 2 years old. Unfortunately, the harness does a poor job supporting infants close to 5 pounds, so you might have to get an extra cushion insert. Also, the seat does not recline, so you&#39;ll have to place padding under the seat to get the correct angle.","When your child is at least 22 pounds, you can switch her to the front-facing position. The seat can stay with her until she is 65 pounds or 52 inches, or about age 8 for both boys and girls. It is a little easier to install the seat in this position, as you don&#39;t have to worry about the seat&#39;s recline. The Guide has a cup holder built into the seat, but it feels flimsy and could brake if your child is rough with it. If the seat becomes messy, you&#39;ll have to handwash the fabrics, as the cushions are not machine washable.","Safety 1st offers a one-year warranty for the Guide 65, and if you lose your user manual, you can download a new one from the website. Customer service is available by email and phone, but we had difficulty reaching a person through either method."]},"id":"e81c54f4-4792-4b53-815d-3464b6c0d8b4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b8dc5f80-fc95-4a4a-85e3-efc7111ee970","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Safety 1st Guide 65 is an affordable baby car seat that will keep your child secure from the time she is born until she is in grade school.
