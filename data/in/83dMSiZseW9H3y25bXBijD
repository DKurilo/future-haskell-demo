It’s also the loudest and has the best sound quality. The Google voice assistant is catching up to the Amazon smart speakers in terms of compatibility and smart home controls, and we think Google offered the best web search results in our tests. The microphone array in the Home Max could hear our voice commands from more than 30 feet away in an adjacent room, which makes this the best smart speaker for your backyard or a large commercial space.","The crowning achievement of the Google Home Max is its audio performance. The dual 4.5-inch woofers and accompanying tweeters performed better than all other smart speakers we tested. The bass is impactful, but not overpowering, and the vocal clarity was true and natural. The audio quality of this speaker is comparable to similarly priced desktop speakers and sound bars that don’t include a voice assistant. You can also send music from your phone or laptop via a Wi-Fi connection, Bluetooth or 1/8-inch aux port. The <a href=\"/sonos-review\">Sonos One</a> is the only speaker we tested that comes close to competing with the Home Max in sound quality. The only audio quirk we found during testing is the directionality of the playback. The speakers face forward, so you might want to avoid putting the speaker in the middle of the room.","The Google smart speakers are compatible with more than 10 music streaming services, including Pandora, YouTube Music and the free version of Spotify. You can link multiple streaming services to your account simultaneously and choose a default service using the Google Home app.","We tested search engine efficiency by asking the voice assistants for suggestions about where to find good local cuisine, what sporting events were on TV and some random trivia-type questions. The Google assistant was our favorite in that test. When we asked Google, “What NBA games are on tonight?” we got a list of all the games and which TV network they were on. Google even listed our local games first. All the other assistants told us which games were on, but Google was the only one that sorted by local event first.","The one shortcoming of the Google assistant compared to Alexa and Siri is smart home controls. We made a list of the 25 most popular and highest-rated smart home products, and at the time of our review, Google was compatible with 11 of those products – Amazon devices were compatible with all 25.","The Google Home Max has the best sound quality of any smart speaker we tested. However, it’s hard to justify the $400 price tag when you can get the Sonos One that sounds almost as good for half the price. The Home Max is significantly louder than all the other smart speakers we tested, so if you want a voice assistant for a large room, or to use in your backyard while you do yardwork, this is a great option."]},"id":"b11ae8d2-b211-43c4-a44a-763ca1b9a7c5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69897","url":"/google-home-max-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-04-26T21:12:55Z","datePublished":"2018-04-26T21:12:55Z","name":"Google Home Max","synopsis":"The Google Home Max is the most expensive and largest smart speaker we tested.
