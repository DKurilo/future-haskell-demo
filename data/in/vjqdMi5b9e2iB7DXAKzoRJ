It is waterproof down to 33 feet and can operate in temperatures ranging from 14 to 104 degrees. It has all of the features you get with the best <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">waterproof cameras</a>. It has a 12.1MP image sensor, a 5X optical zoom lens, a 28mm wide angle lens and an optical image stabilizer that ensures your photos do not blur. It even comes with a continuous shooting mode that takes 1.9 shots per second.","The Canon PowerShot D20 underwater camera is equipped with a CMOS sensor that regulates how much light is used with each individual pixel. This helps ensure that you get good photos in low light. It also has a built-in flash so you can take photos at night or in deep water.","Canon has placed a handy movie button on the body of the camera. You just press it and is starts recording instantly. This allows you to capture unexpected moments or filming opportunities that arise quickly. You don’t have to scroll through a menu to activate it. Just tap the button and shoot. Additionally, it is equipped with a sound filter that improves the quality of your audio.","Although we like the convenient movie button, the power button, picture taking button and playback buttons are too close together on the top of the camera. You may accidentally hit the playback button when trying to take a photo. We would like to have seen the playback button located elsewhere.","The Canon PowerShot D20 offers a built-in GPS that allows you to find your way when exploring new locations. The spot where you take your videos and stills is embedded on your images so you will remember where they were taken.","You will get plenty of photo effects, like black and white and vivid color. With shooting modes that include snow, fireworks and monochrome, you will have many selections for creating your own artistic images. Convenient features, including auto red-eye reduction, white balance, and a self-timer, are included with this camera.","The Canon PowerShot D20 is powered by removable, rechargeable Li-ion batteries. You can expect 280 shots per charge or 5 hours of video time. You will need to purchase an SD, SDHC or SDXC memory card for storage.  The Sony Cyber-shot does not have internal memory.","The body of this underwater digital camera is constructed with a hard plastic casing that is curved on one end making it easy to grip. It is sturdy and has waterproof seals. It comes with an adjustable wrist strap. Because this camera does not float, you will want to secure it to your wrist when using in water."]},"id":"e3c7683e-23d6-4497-9898-b6060ee41e51","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"33961093-8428-4002-a47f-ef440cc54bc1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Canon PowerShot D20 has the ability to operate under water or on the ski slopes.
