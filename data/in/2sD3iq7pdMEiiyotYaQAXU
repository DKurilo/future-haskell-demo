You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you&#39;re looking to record high quality home videos,  then you&#39;ll want to consider an <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">HD video camera</a>. The GZ-VX815 from JVC records full 1080p HD video at 60 frames per second (FPS), and both of these stats are on par with the best HD camcorders we reviewed.","The optical zoom capability of this HD video camera is only 10x. This is an average optical zoom, and some of the best HD camcorders have up to a 30x optical zoom. In terms of video quality, this camcorder also performs fairly well in low-light situations. The JVC GZ-VX815&#39;s low-light lux rating is above average at 1.0.","This HD camcorder includes built-in Wi-Fi, which allows you to upload and share your videos almost instantly through your home wireless network and without the use of cables, giving you a truly wireless experience.","If you would like to use your HD video camera as a home monitoring system, JVC has you covered. The GZ-VX815 offers a home detection and live monitoring mode. Just download JVC&#39;s app and your camcorder can stream video live to your phone. The app also works as a remote too.","Unfortuantely, this camcorder does not having any integrated memory, so you&#39;ll need to purchase a separate memory card in order to record video. The battery life of this camcorder will give you only 40 minutes of recording time. Of course, the battery life will vary depending on the recording settings you&#39;re using, but this average is relatively low among the HD camcorders we reviewed.","If you&#39;re not a fan of bulky handheld camcorders, the GZ-VX815 is a great option. It is one of the lightest and compact handheld camcorder, barely weighing half a pound. A lightweight high definition camcorder like this one is easy to carry around, making it great for vacations or for packing around to capture video of every day events."]},"id":"b071ce21-5ae1-48d8-b57d-ef6a9ed5c106","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"38eb5732-e0f2-4c3e-900c-9f079987477a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This JVC HD camcorder has a sleek and small design that makes it highly portable and easy to manage.
