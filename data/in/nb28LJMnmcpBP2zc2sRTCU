The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 <a href=\"/best-baby-video-monitors\">Baby Video Monitors</a> here.</em>","The BabyPing Baby Monitor, like other Wi-Fi-enabled baby video monitors, lets you monitor your baby using your own devices, like iPhones and iPads. It has several great features to recommend it, including snapshot capabilities and remote monitoring from anywhere in the world.","However, it lacks several features that the top-rated  baby video monitors offer, such as two-way audio, lullaby and temperature sensor, which have become increasingly common among both traditional and Wi-Fi-enabled monitors. It also lacks the Android support options that some of the other WiFi-enabled monitors offer, so you will be limited to iOS devices with this monitor.","The app that comes with the device only allows for local monitoring, which would somewhat defeat the purpose of a Wi-Fi-connected monitor. However, you can obtain a free BabyPing + app separately that will allow you to monitor from anywhere in the world. This app is free to download and completely free to use. You can also share access with friends and family and they are not restricted in terms of time either.","Set up for this device requires an Ethernet cable to download the app. While this may be inconvenient, it involves a simple six-step set up, followed by an optional tutorial, and you are up and running in just a few minutes. After that, you can run the app wirelessly. That being said, having a physical Ethernet connection is always a good thing in the event you are unable to connect to Wi-Fi for whatever reason. Setup for the free BabyPing + app is also quick and easy.","The BabyPing is a fixed-lens camera, so there is no panning, tilting or zooming  – remotely or otherwise. As your baby grows, this could become more of a problem as you will want a mobile camera to keep up with your increasingly mobile baby. It does have wall mount capability, however, so you can get a good angle for viewing your baby in the crib or play area.","As for help and support, BabyPing has one of best and most convenient services out there. When you go to the website, a live chat option pops up on the bottom of the screen automatically and you are chatting in a matter of seconds with helpful, friendly operators. Representatives aren&#39;t always available for chat, but when they are, it is a great service. The company can also be reached via email and phone and they will get back to you promptly with answers to your questions. They also have a helpful online manual that will address many of the issues you may encounter as you familiarize yourself with this new device."]},"id":"98e5844e-7c84-4dd5-81e2-c97fc665a4c3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c6219aea-cdae-4229-b9bc-e23610c60f0a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The BabyPing baby video monitor is on the cutting edge of monitors in some respects, while lagging behind in others.
