The intuitive touch slide interface allows you to easily switch between navigation, music, video and more. The screen is smaller than some of the other models we reviewed, and it is lacking some navigational and multimedia features; nonetheless, this <a href=\"/best-in-dash-navigation-systems\">car GPS navigation</a> system will keep you on track and entertained."]},"id":"baf07f8b-3ff9-4c82-9a1f-e9cbb71d293d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Navigation &amp; Connectivity"},"id":"f925f48c-0fe0-43d6-905c-00a1aae7c47d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This double DIN in-dash navigation unit uses a Tele Atlas map database. This database includes over 12 million points of interest (POIs), so you’re sure to find that popular restaurant you’re looking for in the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Canada or Puerto Rico. The monitor is only 6.1 inches, but that still should be plenty of room to easily see any of the five different display modes (2D, 3D, Street View, Rear View and ECO Graph). Plus, the intuitive touchscreen interface allows you to slide and spin menus and easily switch between activities.","Another standout feature of the Pioneer AVIC-X920BT in-dash navigation receiver is the Eco Driving display. This environmentally friendly function will help monitor your fuel usage and let you know if you’re getting the most out of your car. It can also direct you to more eco-friendly routes and even give you a fuel cost report. The Eco Driving feature is a helpful learning tool to help you become more conscious of your environmental impact and it can also help you save some money.","As you’re driving, you’ll get turn-by-turn directions using either the voice guidance system or the text-to-speech function. This will help you keep your eyes on the road instead of constantly checking the map. To further help you concentrate on your driving, this in-dash navigation system also will respond to simple voice commands to search for an address, select an album or call someone on your phone."]},"id":"1f56901c-fa27-43fb-bd02-22f82884d5dd","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Features"},"id":"d1305ce5-3861-42bc-ae0c-e8950bf36c4b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With the built-in Bluetooth feature, you’ll be able to make calls and accept calls hands-free. The Bluetooth connection can also connect an iPod or other Bluetooth-enabled media player to your in-dash navigation receiver. However, if you want to control your device from the in-dash unit, you’ll need to purchase the CD-IU50V adapter cable. You can also stream live music from the online service Pandora, but you need to have an iPhone with the Pandora App downloaded on it.","In addition to the standard AM/FM tuner that is built into the Pioneer AVIC-X920BT, you can also receive satellite radio and HD radio signals if you have the correct adapter. If you want XM Satellite Radio, the GEX-P920XM adapter is required. For SIRIUS Satellite Radio, the CD-SB10 adapter is required and you need the SC-C1 SiriusConnect Universal Tuner, which is sold separately. Finally, for HD Radio you will need to get the GEX-P20HD adapter. It disappointing that these features are not built into the unit, but you’ll still be able to stay entertained with the DVD/CD player or by connecting your iPod via the auxiliary input port or the USB port."]},"id":"697e7f25-d48b-4ffd-b89a-621de79c978c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"2343eb94-8a97-430a-bb9c-981612a27100","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pioneer site has a small FAQs page in addition to their knowledgebase.
