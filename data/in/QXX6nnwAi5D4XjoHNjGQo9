We considered dozens of models and cooked many pounds of food. Afterward, we had taste testers sample the results and give feedback of how each model performed. Each steamer was subjected to a battery of tests to see if it delivers on its promises, and we compared each model’s features to see which one gives you the most value for your dollar.","<strong>How We Tested </strong>","We subjected each of the food steamers we reviewed to a battery of tests to gauge how effective they are at steaming common types of food. ","Fish Quality<br/>We cooked 6 ounces of fish for the time suggested in each food steamer&#39;s manual. Testers then tasted the fish and judged it based on how well it absorbed the flavors from our aromatics and how moist and tender it was. On average, fish cooked in 19 minutes, but the best steamers cooked it in as little as 15 minutes.","Chicken Quality<br/>We set each food steamer to cook 6 ounces of chicken for the time specified in its product manual. Testers tasted each sample and scored the steamers based on whether they produced chicken that was tender, moist, flavorful and not overcooked. On average, chicken cooked in 25 minutes, but the best steamers cooked it in as little as 20 minutes.","Vegetable Quality<br/>We steamed 1/2 pound of similarly sized small potatoes in each food steamer for the time specified in its user manual. We then taste tested each batch and judged the potatoes based on tenderness and flavor infused from the added spices. Potatoes came out nearly perfect in each case – they were fully cooked and tender. On average, potatoes cooked in 27 minutes, but the best steamers can cook them in 20 minutes. ","Rice Quality<br/>We cooked 1 cup of rice, covering it with water in the provided rice bowl or a separate bowl if one was not included. We cooked each batch for the time suggested in the steamer’s manual and then taste tested the results. On average, rice cooked in 36 minutes, but the best steamers can cook it in 20 minutes. ","<strong>How Much Does a Food Steamer Cost?<br/></strong>We tested steamers ranging in price from about $14 up to $40, with an average price of approximately $25. Price doesn’t necessarily indicate a steamer’s quality. Rather, you should consider its capacity, features and ease of use as well as how easy it is to clean.","<strong>Is Steamed Food Really All That Healthy?</strong>","Steaming is one of the healthiest way to cook everything from beef to broccoli, according an <a href=\"https://www.healthyoptions.com.ph/newsdigest/health-manual-for-all-ages/5-reasons-why-steamed-food-is-the-healthiest\">article</a> published by Healthy Options. Among other things, eating steamed food can help you lower your cholesterol – steaming meat removes fat, unlike frying, baking and grilling. Also, you don’t need to use butter, oil or any other fat to cook meat when you use a steamer.","Steaming is also an excellent way to prepare vegetables since it cooks them thoroughly without sapping them of essential vitamins and minerals. In addition, steamed vegetables retain their taste, color, juices and freshness better than those cooked other ways. Other cooking methods, such as boiling, can destroy naturally occurring vitamin B, riboflavin, thiamine, niacin, biotin B12, pantothenic acid and vitamin C as well as minerals like calcium, phosphorous, potassium and zinc.","An<a href=\"https://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/cooking-ideas/5-healthiest-ways-cook\"> article</a> published online by Shape Magazine also encourages steaming many foods, especially vegetables, chicken breasts, fish and shellfish. “It&#39;s perfect for fish and shellfish because it doesn&#39;t dry out the delicate flesh. Halibut, cod and snapper steam particularly well,” the article states. Shape recommends jazzing up your steamed meals with herbs and other natural flavorings and to avoid using salt, which will wash off. For example, you can steam a fish fillet in foil with some garlic, grated ginger, onion, basil leaves and a bit of lemon juice.<br/><br/><strong>How to Choose a Food Steamer </strong>","As you look for the best vegetable steamer for your home, consider the following:","Size<br/>Food steamer size is measured in quarts, and most models are 3 quarts or bigger. They also usually have one to three tiers. When you buy a model with more than one tier, you can stack different items and steam them at the same time or cook large foods and big batches.","If you buy a combination rice cooker and food steamer, the size is relative to the number of cups of rice the cooker makes. The larger the rice cooker, the larger the steamer basket will be. Small steamers are great for cooking a single dish, while a three-tier model can cook a whole meal.","Versatility<br/>Dedicated food steamers can accommodate a variety of foods, but if you often cook rice, it makes sense to get a rice cooker and food steamer combo. These machines typically limit the variety of food you can prepare at the same time because there is only one basket for steaming other foods. Still, if you usually eat rice and meats or vegetables together, a food steamer and rice cooker combo is a convenient way to prepare a meal. <br/><br/>Ease of Use<br/>Food steamers come in electronic and stovetop varieties. Electronic steamers have timers, so you can set them and do other things while you wait for your food to cook. Stovetop varieties need some monitoring – you have to keep an eye on water levels and perfect your timing so your food is cooked the way you want it. The best steamers are dishwasher safe so there are no pots to clean."]},"id":"78724cf2-ac69-48d7-bf9f-d448271afa81","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_193","url":"/best-food-steamers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
