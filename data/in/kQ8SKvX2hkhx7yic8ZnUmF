You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Coming in as an average choice for <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">digital cameras for children</a>, the Sesame Street Real Digital Camera has some positive aspects and some negative aspects. It takes lower quality pictures and does not offer the durability the best digital cameras for kids provide. It does, however, provide a review screen, more memory and an external memory slot placing it above many other digital cameras for kids. We recommend viewing the higher ranked products before making a purchase, but if your child is a Sesame Street fan, this review should help serve as a guide.","Although there is always hope, adults should not expect high resolution digital cameras for children. They are built to be inexpensive so that if it does get broken somehow, the loss is not too great. The 0.3 megapixel resolution that the Sesame Street Real Digital Camera offers is comparable to most other digital cameras suitable for children. It does offer a flash which makes it possible for kids to take pictures nearly anywhere inside or outside. The digital camera for children comes with software that allows kids to play games or edit their pictures by adding a frame.","Beginner digital cameras for children may be the first digital camera that your kids own and can operate all by themselves. It was not built as durable as many others we reviewed which is why we lowered its ranking in this area. Although it is tough, it cannot withstand any drop or accident a child may cause it. The child-friendly camera is designed to be held with two hands, increasing the stability a child has when they use it. There is 8MB of internal storage and an SD card slot for additional storage. Knowing how important it is for kids to view their pictures immediately after taking them, we were pleased to find these digital cameras for children have a 1.5” color LCD screen. The screen can be used to take pictures or simply to review pictures that have already been captured.","One of our major problems with these Sesame Street digital cameras for children is the extended shutter. Kids must hold extremely still while taking a picture because the shutter speed is relatively slow and if they move too quickly, the pictures come out blurry. Sometimes it is easy enough for the child to remember to hold still, especially if they have practiced, but other times they simply will not hold still long enough to get a decent shot.","The Kids Station, Inc. website provides next to no helpful information regarding their products and company. Through an online search engine we were able to find a phone number for the Kids Station, Inc. located in Longview, Texas. Through the Kids Station Longview website we were also able to find an email address for the company. The camera does come with an instruction manual that we highly suggest customers read because it gives great insight and will help you fully understand its features."]},"id":"a2f1a2e4-ac66-4a68-8aab-4bcc40073b8d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4a556b38-5703-4778-b9e9-7553ba79a615","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall we felt like the Sesame Street Real Digital Camera is a decent product.

Although it is not the best digital camera for kids, it is still a decent product and better than many other choices available.
