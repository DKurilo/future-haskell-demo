Despite these minor drawbacks, the B550 is better than other budget <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/outdoor/best-garage-door-openers/\">garage door openers</a>. Positive customer reviews reinforced the quality of this product.","At $160, the Chamberlain C410 costs about $40 less than an average garage opener, and it’s only $20 more than the cheapest openers in our comparison, the Craftsman 54930 and the <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/home/outdoor/best-garage-door-openers/genie-chain-drive-500-review/\">Genie Chain Drive 500</a>. The Chamberlain C410 has more features and accessories than these less-expensive models, so it’s ultimately a better value.","Unlike more highly ranked garage openers, the C410 uses a 1/2-HP chain-driven motor, meaning it’s louder than belt, screw and jackshaft openers. However, most customer reviews didn’t mention it being very loud. If you’re replacing an older, chain-driven opener, you can expect the C410 to run more quietly, but it will still generate more noise than a belt-driven opener."]},"id":"1e56d8c1-08e0-4651-95ac-76c92737cb12","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/S6adPsZvUTPN73TzMDLQZh.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Among the garage door openers we evaluated, the C410 is the only chain-driven opener – and the cheapest one – to have a built-in timer-to-close function.
