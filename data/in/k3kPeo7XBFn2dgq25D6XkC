You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Available in nine different color options, the AW3D XL 3D printer is one of the more customizable and chic printers available. When you print with an Airwolf AW3D printer, you&#39;ll get your <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">3D printing</a> done in style.","The AW3D printer has a large print capacity. The AW3D XL can print objects up to 12 x 8 x 7 inches. Similar to many other 3D printers we&#39;ve compared, the AW3D has fast print speeds – 150 mm per second – and excellent tolerance levels – 0.04 mm.","ABS and PLA are the 3D printing materials supported by the AW3D XL. This printer is also 3 mm universal cartridge capable, but not multicolor capable, so only one color per model.","Whether you want to build your own printer or have one preassembled for you, the AW3D XL comes in both versions. If you want a 3D printer kit, be sure you have the knowhow and skills to build it yourself. The XL is an acrylic machine with a heated platform, should you want to print with ABS. One great feature is the number of frame colors you can select from. From pink and purple to red or blue, there&#39;s a printer frame color for everyone.","Getting in touch with Airwolf is easy to do: Just send a quick email or call the customer support phone number. Not only does the Airwolf website have a FAQs page, you can also find a blog, tutorials, a wiki page and a downloadable manual for both the AW3D XL and the AW3D 5.5. There is a six-month warranty on both machines, which begins after the one-week lead time.","Whether you have a Mac or Windows computer, the software and 3D printer itself will be compatible. Simply connect your computer to the printer with a USB cable, and you&#39;re ready to print.","Accessories for the AW3D XL include starter filament cartridges, maintenance tools, a USB cable, power supply and instructions on where to download software. 3D design software that will work with this 3D printer is vast, but Airwolf recommends downloading a free version of MatterControl for beginners or Repetier Host for more advanced skill levels."]},"id":"0e9f0321-9d71-4e4d-80be-9ad3a46ccc68","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3b0494d6-becd-4905-bfd7-18502c2430e5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With well-designed, colorful chassis, large print capacities and versatile filament capabilities, the AW3D XL printer makes 3D printing look even better.
