You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","For a program that costs five dollars more than the number two and three options on our <a href=\"/best-typing-software\">Mac typing software</a> lineup, Mac Typing Tutor certainly does not live up to its price tag.","The feature set is certainly lacking many of the features found in the higher-rated Mac typing software we reviewed, such as playing sounds for incorrectly stricken keys, ability to play background music, adjustable text size, AWPM rate or printable results. While Mac Typing Tutor does offer a few convenient features, such as audio dictation of words or letters to be typed and multiple-user save options, these are hardly enough to make up for what the program lacks.","Mac Typing Tutor does not offer games or tests to help users learn to type properly. While we have mentioned that games are not necessarily deal-breakers for adults who want to improve their typing skills, the same does not apply to tests. We found that testing users on their typing ability after presenting lessons is an excellent judge of progress. Users can track their progress through lessons, but we found that the progress reports are incredibly hard to interpret, full of poor formatting and abbreviations that we couldn’t understand.","The lessons themselves only cover letters on the keyboard, ignoring the numbers (either keyboard or 10-key) and symbols. Lessons teach users to type using letters and letter combinations, words and sentences/paragraphs, but we found the vocabulary range to be narrow. There seemed to be less than a dozen words in the program. Most of them are just adjectives or verbs related to the program, such as “register” or “helpful”…with the exception of the word “typophobic,” which seemed strangely out of place. Other programs have hundreds of words that pop up at random, ensuring that users will not get used to typing just a few select words.","Progress must be saved manually, which is a real hassle when you’re focusing on learning a new skill. To make matters worse, there are absolutely no instructions as to how to install, use or uninstall this particular piece of Mac typing software. While the software itself is relatively easy to use, we found that some of the lesson titles needed a bit more explanation, but we were able to figure them out just by taking the lessons.","Need to contact the developer to solve a problem? You’re out of luck. There is absolutely no contact information, user guide or website included with Mac Typing Tutor; there isn’t even a Help option in the program’s menu, something we haven’t seen in any other Mac typing software we reviewed (or any software we’ve reviewed in the past, for that matter). Extensive investigation using popular web search engines failed to produce any website at all for this developer; we were completely unable to find anything on this program or its developer."]},"id":"d92363c7-5181-410b-b111-a1a834461534","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"91ef5a75-c8d1-4c63-afae-7b52ae0451b9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall, we found Mac Typing Tutor to be the poorest example of Mac typing software among the products we reviewed.
