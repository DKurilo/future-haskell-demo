You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","A fairly expensive <a href=\"/best-pet-tracking-devices\">pet tracking</a> system, this SportDOG TEK 1.0 has no monthly subscription fee because it works with GPS and doesn&#39;t need a cellular network to operate.","SportDOG estimates that the device has a seven-mile tracking range, but users state that it&#39;s more like 1.5 to 3.5 miles under field conditions. The pet tracking collar is suitable for dogs weighing over eight pounds with a neck size of 13 inches or more.","The collar device, rubber strap and whip antenna weigh eight ounces in total. It&#39;s waterproof and submersible up to 25 feet of water. Dogs should only wear the collars for up to 12 hours at a time. It&#39;s important not to attach a leash to the pet tracking collar as it&#39;s not strong enough to cope with the force of a pulling dog.","The handheld GPS locator device is waterproof and submersible up to five feet of water. It has the capability to track up to 12 dogs at once, but you need to purchase additional collars on the Add-a-Dog collar scheme as the pet GPS tracker 1.0 TEK kit only comes with one collar.","Like the <a href=\"/roameo-review\">RoamEO</a>, a backlit LCD display and a text-based menu make reading the screen easy. There is no map showing trails or tracks, just arrows revealing your dogs&#39; positions. These pointers show the status of the dogs (if they&#39;re moving or stopped), the direction of travel and the distance they are from you. In addition, you&#39;re able to see which dog is wearing which collar and the battery status of each collar. You cannot add maps to the TEK series GPS tracking system, but it can store up to 20 waypoints.","When the battery is fully charged, the pet tracking device updates every 2.5 seconds, but as the battery loses power, the update rate lowers to every 10 and then 25 seconds. The handheld device has 20 hours of battery life, while the collar is active for 25 hours between charges. The handheld device can run out of power in the field so it&#39;s a good idea to purchase a car charger to go with the kit. The devices use lithium ion rechargeable batteries, and the charger is compatible with U.S. 110-volt outlets. The lifespan of the hand-held device&#39;s battery is three to five years, and then the unit has to be sent to SportDOG for replacement.","The SportDOG TEK 1.0 kit, which comes with a two-year manufacturer&#39;s warranty. Like the <a href=\"/garmin-review\">Garmin Astro 320</a>, it lets you view all your dogs at the same time and it&#39;s a simple matter to add or delete dogs. It&#39;s an excellent pet tracking system for dogs on retrieving exercises or for taking with you when you&#39;re hiking in the country."]},"id":"303aa491-83b2-4a4e-8b00-7dbd52bdc77f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62783","url":"/sportdog-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-18T00:10:10Z","datePublished":"2015-02-18T00:10:10Z","name":"SportDOG TEK 1.0","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-02-18T00:10:10Z","id":"o5PSFWLGsZkLJEDqYxxdME","meta":{"title":"SportDOG TEK 1.0 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Taking your dog out into the country is no problem when you&#039;ve got the SportDOG TEK 1.0 GPS Tracking System.
