However, don&#39;t let the cute logo and diminutive size fool you. This little axe handles big jobs.","The blade is one piece, made of coated stainless steel. The four-inch blade carries a hardness rating of 57 and 58, which is above average for most camping hatchets and is in the range of recommended hardness for survival knives. That means it cuts into wood well, although the small size may mean more strokes to get through larger logs. In addition, the handle has a contoured choke-up grip to make it easier for slicing or shaving kindling.","While the blade itself is impressive, our testers found the butt of the head useless for hammering. Rather, they depended on the handle butt for high-impact tasks like driving tent stakes into hard ground. The handle butt is designed for this purpose.","The handle of this camp axe is made of thermoplastic rubber with an ABS (Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene) core that is strong and durable in low temperatures and resistant to heat and chemicals. Users with large hands may find the grip a little small, but most people should find it comfortable and easy to control.","The small size and light weight make it a good first time axe for kids. Of course, when allowing a child to use a blade, you should properly watch over them, but the testers at Active Junky said the ease of use made camping chores enjoyable, even to the point of &#34;pulling them away from their smart phones for at least 30 minutes.&#34;","There are two types of sheaths: leather or nylon. Both have a belt loop for easy carrying on the hip or attached to a backpack. The small size and weight, as well as the cheap price tag make this a good option for a survival kit as well.","The lifetime warranty covers material and workmanship but not damage due to abuse or rust. The black oxide coating and 3Cr13 materials should prevent rusting as long as the backpacking axe is properly cared for, however."]},"id":"c1c17dab-287a-4a11-984e-6c7d9fe07a43","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68362","url":"/outdoor-edge-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-12T18:57:32Z","datePublished":"2016-09-12T18:57:32Z","name":"Outdoor Edge Wood Devil","synopsis":"At first glance, this camping axe may seem more like a toy than a tool, and at 10 inches and 1.2 pounds, it's easy for younger campers to handle – with adult supervision, of course.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"At first glance, this camping axe may seem more like a toy than a tool, and at 10 inches and 1.2 pounds, it's easy for younger campers to handle – with adult supervision, of course.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-12T18:57:32Z","id":"Ti8x36HR2SKwcPJZLbgoq7","meta":{"title":"Outdoor Edge Wood Devil Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Outdoor Edge Wood Devil is small and light, making it a good camp axe for backpacking or for young campers.
