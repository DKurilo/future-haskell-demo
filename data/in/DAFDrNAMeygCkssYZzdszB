While it doesn’t have a clip and you can’t wear it on your wrist, it’s still easy to tote around while walking, exercising and going about your day.","During testing, we found the Yamax is great for counting steps – it consistently had a low margin of error. It also calculates calories burned pretty accurately. Distance and active minutes, however, are not so accurate. This step counter also reported that we walked far more miles than we actually did. Its active minutes tracking accuracy is also a bit low compared to the best pedometers; it was off by about 10 minutes per 60 minutes of activity.","The pedometer’s design is a bit outdated, and it looks more like the step trackers of the early 2000s. However, if you’re not a fan of wearing devices on your wrists or clipped to your belt, the Yamax is a great alternative. It’s a small, slim brick about the size of a business card that you slip into a pocket. This pedometer for walking has a large, easy-to-read screen, as well as mode and setting buttons that navigate through different features. It has a full 12 months of battery life from one coin cell battery, which is much longer than some of the best step counters in our review.","The Yamax Power Walker doesn’t have an associated app, Bluetooth capability or custom goals. Since it’s not built to connect to anything, it is easy to use if you don’t care to view your data, don’t have a smartphone or don’t want to download yet another app. Since it doesn’t use an app, the pedometer’s storage capacity is much larger than most – 30 weeks of cumulative data or 30 days of in-depth numbers.","This step counter pedometer comes with a standard 12-month warranty, a manual, and email and phone support from the company. You’ll definitely need the manual to learn how to maneuver the settings and set up your tracker."]},"id":"7adb14a6-14f9-44da-a8b3-fdc037ed7dd7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"5e09fca0-1c47-4a4b-99bd-18eb9d6ed92b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you are mostly interested in counting your steps, the Yamax Power Walker is a simple option that doesn’t require an app. Its long battery life is also great, but you sacrifice extra features."]},"id":"2c098b24-269a-4e83-b272-bf61dc42a049","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_56385","url":"/yamax-power-walker-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"bethany-gordon","url":"/author/bethany-gordon","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Bethany Gordon","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"tegXFQJXWkzcKPbfwtRhn7","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-15T17:07:19Z","datePublished":"2013-05-15T17:07:19Z","name":"Yamax Power Walker EX-510","synopsis":"The Yamax Power Walker is a simple, convenient and traditional pedometer for tracking your steps.","review":{"rating":50,"verdict":"The Yamax Power Walker is a good option if you&#8217;d rather not fiddle with an app to see how many steps you take every day.","pros":["This slim pedometer can store up to 30 weeks of data."],"cons":["The Yamax Power Walker isn&#8217;t Bluetooth capable, so there&#8217;s no way to save your data to or view it in an app."]},"strapline":"The Yamax Power Walker is a simple, convenient and traditional pedometer for tracking your steps.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-05-15T17:07:19Z","id":"DAFDrNAMeygCkssYZzdszB","meta":{"title":"Yamax Power Walker EX-510 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Yamax Power Walker is a traditional pedometer that you slip into your pocket.
