One of its limitations as an all-in-one device is the disc drive&#39;s inability to play CDs or SACDs, though it plays Blu-rays, DVDs and video games.","The PlayStation also lacks live TV integration and playback support of local media. This means you can&#39;t access movies from your personal library, homemade videos and photos, or even play music from an MP3 player.","The PlayStation has some great features though. It&#39;s much heavier than the average media player on the market, weighing about 9 pounds. There is a good reason the device weighs so much. Inside there are 8GBs of DDR5 RAM and a 500-GB hard drive.","The PlayStation supports a lot of popular apps including Netflix, Hulu Plus and Vudu. Sports fans will be happy to know NBA Game Time and NHL Game Center are also supported. There is a web browser, however, which makes up for most missing apps since you can access any website through the browser.","The PlayStation lacks TV integration. You&#39;ll have to switch over to a separate server to access live TV and your cable box to get to your DVR. Other media players make this a quick, easy process by integrating media into a single user interface. That said, toggling between the PlayStation and your cable box is only a minor inconvenience.","The PlayStation has loads of internal storage, so you can store an ample selection of games, apps, screenshots and gaming videos. It comes equipped with an HDMI port, an Ethernet port, an optical port and two USB 3.0 ports in front. However, the USB ports are strictly for charging the controller and can&#39;t be used to access personal media files.","The PlayStation home media server supports most resolutions, including the high-definition widescreen standard of 1080p. For Wi-Fi, it relies on the 2.4GHz frequency using the 802.11 b/g/n wireless standard. It does not support the 5GHz band or 802.11ac standard.","You can plug the headphones into the controller to chat with friends in your network and listen to brilliant surround sound while you&#39;re gaming. The DualShock 4 controller is one of the great features of the PlayStation. It is Sony&#39;s best and most user-friendly controller to date. It fits comfortably in your hands with just the right heft and size. The click-friendly buttons and laptop-like mouse pad makes it easy to navigate through the PlayStation&#39;s menus.","The PlayStation Store has thousands of products to choose from, including movies, games, TV shows and apps. It functions like the iTunes Store, allowing you to buy single episodes of TV shows. You cannot purchase music; instead, you stream through custom radio apps like Spotify.","If you have specific questions, the FAQs section on Sony&#39;s website gives plenty of answers. You can also contact Sony via phone or live chat.","The PlayStation is a great gaming console and media player combined. Such improvements as the stellar DualShock 4 controller and user interface offset inconveniences like the lack of personal media support and the inability to play CDs."]},"id":"e81ac2f1-402a-4310-85ef-6b0f8b05d1df","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_52896","url":"/playstation-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-05-25T14:40:33Z","datePublished":"2011-05-25T14:40:33Z","name":"PlayStation","synopsis":"When it comes to home media server capabilities, the PlayStation is functional though it lacks some important features.
