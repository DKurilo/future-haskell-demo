You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Denna L600 <a href=\"/best-robot-lawn-mowers\">robot lawn mower</a> is a robotic push mower that is safe to use and environmentally friendly. It uses a lithium-ion battery with between one and two hours of run time on a single charge. If you have a large yard, multiple charges are required in order to finish mowing.","It takes between two and six hours to charge the Denna L600 robot lawn mower, depending on the specific battery installed in the mower. This is frustrating if you’re trying to get your lawn finished and run out of battery power, as it means a long wait between mowing sessions. It requires standard 110- or 240-volt AC power to charge the battery, however, so storage and charging options are unlimited as long as you have access to main power.","The blade of the L600 robot lawn mower spins at 3,200 rpm. This is fast enough to pick up and throw debris that the mower runs over, so it is advisable to ensure that the lawn is clear of sticks, rocks and other items before using it.","The Denna L600 robot lawn mower has a mowing width of 10 inches and can automatically mow approximately 480 square feet of lawn area each day, up to a maximum range of 2,000 square meters. The effective range of the remote control is only about 50 feet though, so you probably won’t be able to sit inside the house while your robotic mower does all the work.","This device produces about 65 decibels of sound. This is low for a robot lawn mower but using it late at night or early in the morning may still disturb people.","The L600 robot lawn mower is constructed of rigid ABS plastic so it is able to withstand the rigors of frequent or daily use. Storing the Denna L600 when not in use is easy since its handle folds completely into the body to save space.","The Denna L600 robot lawn mower uses a brushless motor that operates at 60 watts. It has an average walking speed of only 1.5 feet per second, which is somewhat slow. The deck is adjustable, however, to mow from one to 2.5 inches high.","If you’re looking for a robot lawn mower that offers minimal need for interaction the Denna L600 is a good choice. It does have a somewhat slow rate of speed, however."]},"id":"b835fceb-87a2-4382-972c-2f081a508565","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63702","url":"/denna-l600-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"danny-chadwick","url":"/author/danny-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Danny Chadwick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"DhF8Hg8QQde8MtLyq8X8JN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-25T21:08:19Z","datePublished":"2015-03-25T21:08:19Z","name":"Denna L600","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-25T21:08:19Z","id":"nGVFBVjVey8KiEDhVDSmYk","meta":{"title":"Denna L600 Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Denna L600 robot lawn mower is a robotic push mower that is safe to use and environmentally friendly, lasting up to 2 hours on 1 charge."},"products":[{"slug":"denna-l600","url":"/product/denna-l600","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:10Z","name":"Denna L600","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:10Z","id":"EbGUPzPrUNX8oyPgpky3qR","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:16:10Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/rr4xwZv8grVGiYFrMLxYPL.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:10Z","mimeType":"","name":"63674-denna-l600-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63674-denna-l600-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:10Z","id":"rr4xwZv8grVGiYFrMLxYPL","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rr4xwZv8grVGiYFrMLxYPL.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Denna L600 Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Denna L600 robot lawn mower is a robotic push mower that is safe to use and environmentally friendly, lasting up to 2 hours on 1 charge."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/rr4xwZv8grVGiYFrMLxYPL.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:10Z","mimeType":"","name":"63674-denna-l600-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63674-denna-l600-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:10Z","id":"rr4xwZv8grVGiYFrMLxYPL","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rr4xwZv8grVGiYFrMLxYPL.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Denna L600 Robot Lawn Mower Review","description":"The Denna L600 robot lawn mower is a robotic push mower that is safe to use and environmentally friendly, lasting up to 2 hours on 1 charge."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/outdoor/best-robot-lawn-mowers/denna-l600-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:10Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:10Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"lawn-mowers","url":"/home-and-garden/lawn-mowers","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:16:10Z","name":"Lawn Mowers","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:16:10Z","id":"smr57URmWPEAAvpHn7aR9h","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
