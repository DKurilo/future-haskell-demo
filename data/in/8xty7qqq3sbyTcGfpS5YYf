It is the king of the chord method products.  Legacy Learning Systems, based in Nashville, produced this easy to use and visually superior product. Their team of professionals (check out the credits in the back of the lesson book) has also created systems to learn guitar, drums, ballroom dance and even painting.","Several different genres are presented in Learn &amp; Master Piano: Blues, Boogie-Woogie, Pop, Ragtime and Jazz. Beethoven’s Fur Elise is introduced as well, giving you a taste of the classics. Classical music is not a focus with Learn &amp; Master Piano, so if you are interested in moving on to this genre we suggest you try some of our other sites reviewed in our <a href=\"/best-learn-piano-online\">learn piano online</a> review."," <strong>Standout Features</strong>"]},"id":"493d7cc9-f481-4ba9-a674-9ae648b05537","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Professionally produced Videos","Superior Lesson Book format","Multiple track play-along CDs","Resourceful Website forums "],"type":"ul"},"id":"cd9f6d33-ae14-4bc2-84d5-b06410006852","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" "]},"id":"50799a7b-3d9d-45b0-b135-4e20ec4a1e2b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Student Experience"},"id":"97dc88db-5dcf-4052-862d-a320483dbc8a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The program uses DVD instruction which is divided into sessions with companion workshops, to take you from the basics of keyboard setup to playing popular songs in your first lesson. During the sessions, students learn keyboard basics, chord progressions, notation, rhythm, improvisation, music theory and accompanying techniques. A workshop immediately follows where you practice with your teacher. Visuals include full view videos of the teacher playing, overhead hand shots and a graphic of the keyboard showing key depression, similar to watching a player-piano. After you master a lesson piece, use the play-along CD to enhance your experience. The CDs have an intro, count off, instructions and a piano part. The next track omits these elements so you can play solo with the band. Each track allows you to set the speed according to your ability: slow, medium or fast. The lesson book even notes the suggested metronome settings or you can do this with the DVD software."]},"id":"5a2830f0-29bf-40ed-8a04-ef6b4f7cf2e5","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Curriculum"},"id":"4ca9233a-2a48-4627-bc6e-20dfbb5e6c73","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If Learn &amp; Master Piano is a software product, why did it qualify for our Learn Piano Online Revie<strong>w</strong>? Many of the products we reviewed are software programs that also offer a digital online version.

Bonus exercises, a digital lesson book and a discussion board are available to registered users on the website. You can upload audio or video music, chat about the program during scheduled forums, set up your own musical profile page, contact other students, and create or read other member’s blogs on the Learn &amp; Master Student Community Site. The Student Support/Discussion Board offers separate forums for the different products offered by Legacy Learning Systems. At the  Learn &amp; Master Piano forum you can post questions to Will Barrow himself, or use the Specific Session Questions forum to post questions or comments on individual lessons (called ‘Sessions’). The website is clean, concise, and easy to follow, one of the best in our Learn Piano Online Review.

For a software/online combination chord method course, Learn &amp; Master Piano is hard to beat. It is one of the best courses available for the value. You will be hard pressed to find a better quality, more comprehensive product for the price.","While  Learn &amp; Master Piano is intended for students of all ages, younger students will benefit more if monitored or supervised. If you want to find a system that offers more child-focused learning methods, we would suggest Peery Piano or Piano Wizard as better choices; however, with proper parent/teacher supervision Learn &amp; Master Piano could be a successful child piano tool.  Students who have learned to play previously but want to give the piano another try will enjoy the concepts and the ability to play new songs almost immediately—especially since this method of teaching probably wasn’t used by their neighborhood piano teacher. A student in one of the forums had a good perspective on this system. After using the product, she was progressing well but wanted a “real flesh and blood teacher” to monitor her learning process. After doing this, she felt she had the best of both worlds. <strong>Learn &amp; Master Piano</strong> is a great complement and enhancement to traditional teaching methods. Piano students, beginning through advanced, will benefit from this easy to follow, visually exciting program that combines excellent software and online features."]},"id":"567021b4-f5d4-488a-8e35-44259afa224e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_49035","url":"/learn-master-piano-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"billy-bommer","url":"/author/billy-bommer","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Billy Bommer","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"bxro6Nv6xNbugJrSbgckh8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-03-19T04:18:56Z","datePublished":"2010-03-19T04:18:56Z","name":"Learn & Master Piano","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":87,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-03-19T04:18:56Z","id":"8xty7qqq3sbyTcGfpS5YYf","meta":{"title":"Learn & Master Piano Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Learn &amp; Master Piano learn piano online offers professionally produced videos, multiple track play-along CDs, more.
