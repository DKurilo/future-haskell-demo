It certainly makes sense to be a little wary of a super-heated ceramic rod held near your head for up to half an hour! If you&#39;re a novice stylist, Remington&#39;s Curl Perfect Spiral curling iron is a great starting tool to help you get the hang of clamping, controlling and holding your curls.","Unlike other curling irons that reach oven-hot temperatures, the Remington Curl Perfect heats to a modest 340 degrees Fahrenheit. It heats up in under a minute. The simple on and off toggle switch simplifies curling to its essentials. Its ceramic barrel heats evenly and adds shine and smoothness to your curls. <br/>With the help of the unique heat-resistant curl guides, your spiral curls are neat and uniform with every use. Simply hold the Curl Perfect Spiral iron upright on the right side of your head, then upside down on the left side for curls spiraling the same way. You can also alternate for a funky, natural look."]},"id":"becca2e5-4959-4f82-9bad-096618829c0c","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/3qfJPk6mTA4cdDTvxqHyik.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Weighing in at a feathery 0.65 pounds, its super light design makes it a great beginner iron for young stylists to use on themselves or their friends. Unlike the traditional clamps in most curling irons, the Remington Curl Perfect uses a sliding clip to help you avoid unwanted creases or ridges in the curls. Though there isn&#39;t much variety in size, but the 0.75- and 1.75-inch barrel options run the gamut of long to short hair. However, because of its short barrel length, the Remington Curl Perfect works best for medium-length hair if you want curl the whole strand. Don&#39;t despair if you have longer hair though, this curling iron would make great end curls for prom or cute curly ponytails.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57449-remington-curl-perfect2.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3qfJPk6mTA4cdDTvxqHyik.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"3qfJPk6mTA4cdDTvxqHyik","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3qfJPk6mTA4cdDTvxqHyik.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c7741e1d-6d7b-4502-9154-95bda570b8cb","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This spiral curling iron is a great introduction to the different shapes and sizes of curling irons available.
