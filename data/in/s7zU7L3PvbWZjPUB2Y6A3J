A study done in England in 2013 showed office workers in the private sector spent 200 work hours a year in meetings they felt accomplished nothing, while civil servants wasted nearly twice that. And in the United States, that number is a whopping 600 hours, according to the International Matrix Management Institute.","<strong>Now, the Good News:</strong> Well-run meetings with clear purpose increase productivity, improve morale and get tasks done quicker. A study published in MIT Sloan Management Review suggested that meetings have increased in part because of flatter organizational structures, self-directed teams and the empowerment to pursue initiatives. Meetings, then, are no longer just for disseminating information but collaborating and innovation, the building blocks of good business.","Meetings are necessary, and with the advent of <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-web-conferencing-services/\">web-conferencing software</a> to connect people across the globe, they are easier than ever to hold. Make sure your meeting is worthwhile and not a time-wasting horror by following these tips:","<strong>1.\tAsk why you need the meeting.</strong> If you only need to disseminate information, would an email do the job? If the goal is to introduce new employees, maybe something more fun, like a lunch social or walking them around the office, would do the trick.","<strong>2. Set a clear agenda.</strong> If you cannot communicate the purpose of the meeting, its goal and the steps needed to achieve that goal, you are not ready for a meeting.","<strong>3. Set time limits.</strong> Give each agenda item a time limit. Expect some slip for emergencies or the unexpected input, but time limits get across that participants can&#39;t dwell too long on a point. If you have people you know will drone on, warn them privately if needed.","<strong>4. Stick to the important things.</strong> If it does not matter whether Category A belongs on page one or two of the group report, then don&#39;t allow it to take up a lion&#39;s share of your meeting. Call a quick vote if consensus is important   even virtual-meeting services makes it easy with polling options. If consensus is not needed, make a command decision and move on.","<strong>5. Make sure presenters are prepared.</strong> Contact them ahead of time. Ask if they need materials distributed beforehand or loaded onto the server if holding an online meeting. Give them a time limit for their part of the presentation.","<strong>6. Set rules for the meeting.</strong> It might seem like Kindergarten again, but clear rules make even adults comfortable. They are especially helpful if your organization has a history of meetings getting out of control.","<strong>7. Invite only key players.</strong> The more people that attend a meeting, the less productive it becomes. If a person does not have anything to contribute, send them the after-meeting report or relevant files.","<strong>8. Start the meeting on time, and don&#39;t back up for latecomers.</strong> How many times has someone five minutes late wasted 15 minutes of your meeting with greetings, apologies and getting a summary of what he missed? Make a rule: Latecomers should sit in the back until called upon and listen. They can catch up with the after-action report if needed.","<strong>9. Create an atmosphere of collaboration.</strong> It may seem counterintuitive after all the talk of rules and limits, but the most successful meetings happen when attendees work as a team. Encourage input   without letting someone drone on. Call on experts for questions you can&#39;t answer. If a conversation takes you on an important tangent, call a halt with the understanding that it will get pursued offline or at another meeting.","<strong>10. Follow up.</strong> Let attendees know how well the meeting achieved its goals. Create an informative after-action report with the highlights. If using web-conferencing software, distribute a recording.","Meetings are not going to go away. If anything, with organizations depending more heavily on small-group inputs and web-conferencing software making it convenient for people to collaborate online, meetings fill an important role. However, unless the time wasters are removed and replaced with well-run, focused sessions, we will continue to put more hours into accomplishing nothing."]},"id":"12b99b96-688e-49ad-94ec-166b3a26482a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8883","url":"/do-meetings-kill-productivity","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"karina-fabian","url":"/author/karina-fabian","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Karina Fabian","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"o9CuetwPA8ihx3NyLEkVCW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-29T22:01:19Z","datePublished":"2014-10-29T22:01:19Z","name":"Do Meetings Kill Productivity?","synopsis":"First, the Bad News: If you are the average office worker, you are wasting months of productive work time in meetings.","review":{},"strapline":"First, the Bad News: If you are the average office worker, you are wasting months of productive work time in meetings.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-10-29T22:09:33Z","id":"s7zU7L3PvbWZjPUB2Y6A3J","meta":{"title":"Do Meetings Kill Productivity?","description":"Contrary to popular complaint, meetings don&#039;t have to be time wasters.
