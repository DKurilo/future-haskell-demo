If a child or spouse is viewing something online that you deem inappropriate, such as pornography, this computer <a href=\"/best-monitoring-software\">monitoring software</a> can track and record it for you to review. You can protect children from cyber bullying by monitoring Facebook communications, other social media sites and chats. You even can monitor documents written and applications used.","A major drawback to this software is that you cannot block websites and applications. It simply does not have the capability. You may be able to track computer use in your home, but you won&#39;t be able to stop any of it with this software. Prevention will have to take place through personal intervention. This PC monitoring software installs easily and its user interface is simple to operate. You can access features, functions and logs from the main screen. These logs include keystrokes typed, websites visited, applications executed, windows opened, screenshots taken, sent and received email, and chat logs.","This software records desktop screenshots, usernames and passwords. It logs all user-accessed websites. Although it failed to record  the content of email messages during our tests, it saved both sides of chat conversations. This monitoring software can record chats using MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, AOL/AIM Messengers and ICQ. XPCSpy Pro allows you to customize the settings. Options include specifying the monitoring schedule and setting the frequency of screenshots. This software tracks launched applications and online searches. It can run in both stealth and visible modes.","This computer monitoring software lacks the ability to track accessed documents, and it does not offer real-time monitoring. XPCSpy Pro offers few reporting tools. You can receive designated reports via email and FTP. You also can access reports on the monitored computer. This PC monitoring software offers FAQs online, should you need answers to operational questions or troubleshooting assistance. It also has email support, but the company was unresponsive to the queries we sent."]},"id":"4bdb84fc-512a-4d7c-8fcc-f3cb7032833d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"e7d8f25e-0af6-4633-a272-99b7e1d082f9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["XPCSpy Pro has strong monitoring features, including the ability to track websites visited, online searches, usernames and passwords, screenshots and emails.
