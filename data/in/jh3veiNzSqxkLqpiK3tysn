On paper, its specifications are excellent. It has a stock scan rate of 30 pages per minute (ppm) in color, though it can hit 45 ppm in grayscale, and an automatic document feeder with a 60-page capacity. This is notable because most automatic document feeders, like the <a href=\"/brother-imagecenter-review\">Brother ImageCenter</a>, top out at 50 pages. The feeder can also comfortably handle documents of different sizes like ID cards and long papers. This Canon model also features standard support for duplex scanning and optical text recognition. All of these put its performance on par with some of the best document scanners.","As strong as the imageFORMULA’s performance is, it suffers from limitations in other areas. Like with most business-centric document scanners, the Canon’s software allows you to export documents directly to email clients and cloud services like Evernote and Google Drive. However, its connectivity options fall behind those of the best desktop scanners. It can’t export to mobile devices and doesn’t have physical connectivity options like an SD card slot, networking or a USB port for storage devices. ","While the imageFORMULA’s performance is excellent, this lack of connectivity options can make it less than ideal for offices that need a dedicated scanner to regularly serve multiple employees or an entire department. Considering that some lower-end Canon desktop scanners include network connectivity, it’s a notable inconvenience for the C240. ","Canon includes a one-year warranty on the imageFORMULA DR-C240, and there are a variety of ways to find help if you have questions or concerns. While the manufacturer doesn’t offer live chat support, you can contact representatives by email and phone. There are also online resources like downloads and troubleshooting help."]},"id":"29acf703-9d87-4910-a0e3-278358e41ed2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9dcfc8d2-c1e3-4a2e-a38f-6288b94c6082","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Like many business-level desktop scanners, the imageFORMULA is anchored around strong specifications, and its excellent scanning performance falls in line with top models.
