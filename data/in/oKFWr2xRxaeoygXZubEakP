You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Panasonic Arc3 ES-RT97-S is an <a href=\"/best-electric-head-shavers\">electric shaver</a> with many included benefits. This device includes wet and dry shaving capabilities, a charging station and a five-setting comb included with the product. It also features a three-blade cutting system that allows you to get a close cut whether you use the device on your face or your head. This electric razor performed exceptionally well, and our testers used it to shave off the stubble that many other products on our lineup left behind.","This electric head shaver can get a close cut on your face, chin, neck and head. It features Multi-Flex Arc micro foils that easily cut your hair. The shaver features a pivoting head so it can move around the many contours of your face and head, and it will cut all hair, including hair on your neck and face. Additionally, the blades featured on this Panasonic shaver are positioned at a 30-degree angle to help get a close cut without sacrificing your comfort while shaving.","When we tested this product, we found it exceptionally simple to use. It took six to eight passes for the shaver to remove hair in one area of the head, which is excellent considering many similar products took 12 or more passes.","The Panasonic ES-RT97-S can shave both wet and dry hair. This is a great feature, as many similar products are only designed for dry shaving. It also features a pop-up trimmer that allows you to give your hairlines, such as your neckline, facial hair and sideburns, a definite shape.","This electric razor is cordless. After shaving with this product, you place the electric razor in the included charging stand. This product will last up to 50 minutes on a single battery charge. We would like to see a longer battery life on this product – it will last 60 minutes or longer. However, it only takes approximately 60 minutes for the electric head shaver to fully recharge. This is one of the shortest recharging times we saw on this type of device. If you&#39;re interested in a shaver with a long battery life, you should consider the <a href=\"/skull-shaver-bald-eagle-review\">Skull Bald Eagle Smart</a>.","Cleaning and maintenance for this Panasonic electric shaver is also simple. You can rinse the razor under water to remove all cut hairs. You do not have to worry about any lengthy cleaning process after each use with this electric shaver.","Additionally, the Panasonic ES-RT97-S includes a handful of accessories. A five-setting comb is a large benefit of this product. The comb attaches to the head of the razor and allows you to trim hair instead of shave it. You can choose to trim hair from 1 to 7 mm long. Furthermore, the charging stand is included with this product but, unfortunately, the product does not come with a hard storage case."]},"id":"53cc88e1-0062-487a-9d1d-a4599025f6d4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"be396bd2-b09c-4f49-980c-584d884a9277","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Panasonic ES-RT97-S is an excellent option for an electric shaver.
