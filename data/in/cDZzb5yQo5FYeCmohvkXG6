It consists of a mechanical prefilter system that removes particulates as small as 5 microns from your water; a saltless <a href=\"/best-water-softeners\">water softener</a>; and a chemical filter that removes chlorine, chloramines and other chemical compounds, which can make water taste better.","This whole-home water softener is available with two different output capacities: 10 gpm, which is recommended for homes with one to three bathrooms, and 15 gpm for homes with four to six bathrooms. The salt-free system comes with the valves and connectors required to set up the prefilter and two tanks, but you will need extra fittings to connect the system to your home&#39;s water supply. This filter requires no electrical power and no drain connection, so you can install it either indoors or outside.","The unit does require some regular maintenance. You must replace the prefilter media, a simple cartridge-style filter, and O-ring seal every six to nine months, depending on the level of use. The carbon filtration media in the chemical filter must be replaced every five years, after approximately 600,000 to 1,000,000 gallons of water have been treated.","Replacing the carbon media is a more complex operation that requires disconnecting the filter tank and soaking the new carbon media for 48 hours before reconnecting it to the water system. The water softener media never needs replacement, however.","This saltless water softener does not remove minerals from your water supply. Instead, the catalytic media converts calcium and magnesium into nonbinding crystals that do not interact with pipes or other surfaces. This water softener system is appropriate for water sources with a hardness of up to a very high 75 gpg. It prevents scale buildup and makes your soap, laundry detergent and other cleaning products more effective. To use this saltless water softener, your water source cannot contain iron, manganese or hydrogen sulfide. If it does, you must pretreat your water to remove these impurities. If you live in an area that is better-suited to a salt-based water softener, the <a href=\"/krystal-pure-review\">Krystal Pure KS15HE</a> is a good choice.","Pelican Water Systems offers a 90-day satisfaction guarantee and a reasonably good five-year performance guarantee on this water softener and filtration system. The company also offers a limited lifetime warranty on tanks and parts.","The Pelican Whole House Filter &amp; Salt-Free Softener is a complete water treatment solution for your home. It adds physical and chemical filtration to the hardness neutralization. The system does not require salt or an electrical connection, but you do have to replace the prefilter cartridge and the chemical filter carbon media from time to time."]},"id":"fc6bfdbf-0e1c-457e-a5d5-45e9bdde3399","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63251","url":"/pelican-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T19:21:31Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T19:21:31Z","name":"Pelican Whole House Filter & Salt-Free Softener","synopsis":"The Pelican Whole House Filter & Salt-Free Softener is a three-part filtration and water softening system.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The Pelican Whole House Filter & Salt-Free Softener is a three-part filtration and water softening system.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-05T19:21:31Z","id":"cDZzb5yQo5FYeCmohvkXG6","meta":{"title":"Pelican Whole House Filter & Salt-Free Softener Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Pelican Whole House Filter &amp; Salt-Free Softener neutralizes hard water minerals and filters chemicals from your water.
