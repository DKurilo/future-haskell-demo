You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The GO 2535 TM WTE has accurate maps, including maps of locations that many other GPS units we reviewed don&#39;t have, and a bright screen that is easy to see. The TomTom GO 2535 TM WTE includes maps of the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe, making this navigation GPS device a world traveler.","While the 5-inch screen is a typical size for auto GPS devices, this device uses a glass capacitive screen, which is an upgrade from basic navigation GPS units. The screen is capable of multitouch, allowing you to effortlessly scroll through menus and zoom in and out of maps by pinching your fingers. The screen resolution is standard at 480 x 272 pixels and not the upgraded HD quality. Despite the lower pixel number, the screen has a clean and crisp display. You can adjust the display options with brightness settings and day and night color settings.","The GO 2535 TM WTE comes with lifetime map and traffic updates. TomTom  comes out with updated maps four times a year so that you can have the most current editions with all the new roads, developments, businesses and other landmarks. For the life of your GO 2535 TM WTE, you will receive real-time traffic updates so that you can avoid frustrating delays that cost you time. When a traffic situation does arise, the unit will suggest a new route if a better one is available. This device speaks the names of streets, even in foreign languages, but it can&#39;t give directions using landmarks or buildings to clarify further.","Points of interest (POIs) are locations such as restaurants, gas stations, businesses and banks, to name a few, and your TomTom GO 2535 TM WTE comes preloaded with 7 million  POIs. You can pick certain POIs as your favorites and even create a few custom POIs, but your device can only store up to 48 of these. When planning a route, you can use up to three waypoints; however, your GO 2535 TM WTE won&#39;t automatically sort them into the most direct path. You will manually have to choose which waypoints to go to and in what order. This GPS unit is not capable of saving routes and itinerary because of its limited memory and lack of expandable memory. However, this device comes preloaded with eco (fuel-efficient) routes and pedestrian mode options."]},"id":"6aa0b3c5-8b1d-45dd-bf28-b5268c005c1c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"afbb58de-b8cb-454a-8fc2-b52611c8167f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The capacitive touchscreen makes using the TomTom GO 2535 TM WTE easy with the zoom and scrolling options, and the display is easy to read, even in sunlight.

Overall, the GO 2535 TM WTE is not a bad GPS device, but it definitely could use improvement in later iterations."]},"id":"75769af0-7164-49b3-b006-e3e11bdcf571","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53503","url":"/tomtom-go-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-23T18:15:43Z","datePublished":"2011-08-23T18:15:43Z","name":"TomTom Go 2535 TM WTE","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":80,"verdict":"The TomTom GO 2535 TM WTE has a few convenient and advanced features, but it could use more of the basic tools.","pros":["The TomTom GO 2535 TM WTE has a glass capacitive touchscreen that is intuitive, capable of multitouch and easy to use and read."],"cons":["This device cannot save routes and has limited waypoint options."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-08-23T18:15:43Z","id":"3aQAMEBFRCjrsUzaAefAyj","meta":{"title":"TomTom Go 2535 TM WTE Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"If you are looking for auto GPS units, read our  about the TomTom GO 2535 TM WTE to see what makes it different from other units on the market."},"products":[{"slug":"tomtom-go-2535-tm-wte","url":"/product/tomtom-go-2535-tm-wte","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:58:29Z","name":"TomTom Go 2535 TM WTE","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:58:29Z","id":"JCXvb3YdBayebUFWUNYXxS","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:58:29Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/khsSCHsUr5L93dp4rV28CB.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:58:29Z","mimeType":"","name":"53475-tomtom-go-2535-tmwte-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/53475-tomtom-go-2535-tmwte-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:58:29Z","id":"khsSCHsUr5L93dp4rV28CB","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khsSCHsUr5L93dp4rV28CB.jpg","alt":""},"title":"TomTom Go 2535 TM WTE Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"If you are looking for auto GPS units, read our  about the TomTom GO 2535 TM WTE to see what makes it different from other units on the market."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/khsSCHsUr5L93dp4rV28CB.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:58:29Z","mimeType":"","name":"53475-tomtom-go-2535-tmwte-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/53475-tomtom-go-2535-tmwte-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:58:29Z","id":"khsSCHsUr5L93dp4rV28CB","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khsSCHsUr5L93dp4rV28CB.jpg","alt":""},"title":"TomTom Go 2535 TM WTE Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"If you are looking for auto GPS units, read our  about the TomTom GO 2535 TM WTE to see what makes it different from other units on the market."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/gps/best-navigation-gps/tomtom-go-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:58:29Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:58:29Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gps","url":"/electronics/gps","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:58:29Z","name":"GPS","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:58:29Z","id":"PaNWioUkFhvsXZKxXS5PLR","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
