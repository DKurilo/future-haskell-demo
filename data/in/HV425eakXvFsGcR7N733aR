This unit measures 20.5 inches deep, 14.17 inches wide and 12.40 inches high, which is standard for a meat slicer.","You can slice vegetables, meat and other food items with this electric meat slicer. This can come in handy in your small restaurant or for dinner parties in your home.","The blade on this slicing machine is 8 inches in diameter, which isn’t as large as professional-grade meat slicers but is sufficient for a home meat slicer You can also remove the blade, which makes it easy to thoroughly clean the unit after every use so bacteria doesn&#39;t build up on it.","This electric meat slicer has 0.20 horsepower, running 150 watts and a blade speed of 300 rpm, which is sufficient for a home food slicer, and can even handle the slicing needs of a restaurant. However, this meat slicer can&#39;t handle the high-volume operation that some restaurants require.","This meat slicer is belt driven, which gives it cutting consistency and durability with frequent use. Furthermore, the carriage on this unit is designed to move back and forth smoothly on its ball bearings, which makes it easy to cut deli meat and other foods such as vegetables.","The most impressive safety feature on this unit is its rubber feet, which keep it from sliding back and forth while you operate it. It also features a plastic plate cover that will cover the blade as you move the unit back and forth while slicing food.","You can safely use the Omcan 195F food slicer as a home or even a commercial meat slicer. It will slice meat, vegetables and other foods with precision every time."]},"id":"94668f7c-5156-4a54-b76f-1df89853eead","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59413","url":"/omcan-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-spear","url":"/author/rebecca-spear","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Spear","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"X8Ccy4LP9pMXtXdurbSshX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-23T04:06:17Z","datePublished":"2014-04-23T04:06:17Z","name":"Omcan 195F","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
