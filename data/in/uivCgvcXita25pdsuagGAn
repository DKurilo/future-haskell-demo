They evolved over the past several decades and are continually changing. This guide explains 10 of the worst types of past and recent computer viruses and provides simple solutions for avoiding them.","<strong>1. Browser Hijacker</strong><br/>Imagine typing in an internet address and automatically bouncing through several different sites. When this happens, a browser hijacker is responsible for the incident. Unfortunately, hijackers are usually attached to appealing toolbars, programs and other free downloads you choose. They often have the word &#34;search&#34; in their names. A good security program can detect nearly all of these.","<strong>2. File Infector</strong><br/>One of the most common types of computer viruses is a file infector. These viruses attach to host files, so this means they usually stick to files you use often. Any time you open or run the file, the virus is running. It can even take over the file completely.","<strong>3. Macro Virus</strong><br/>This is another type of file-based virus. It attaches to files made from programs that support macros. Some examples are Microsoft Excel and Word, and people often unknowingly download them from email attachments. A good security program scans these types of files before you download them to detect any threats.","<strong>4. Polymorphic Virus</strong><br/>These viruses are harder to detect. This is because security programs scan coding to identify viruses, but these specific viruses both encrypt and change their coding. They continually changing their operations over time, which may affect the programs you use.","<strong>5. Multipartite Virus</strong><br/>Some types of computer viruses only spread in one way, but these ones spread in several ways. Their actions usually depend on the form of operating system you use, certain programs on your computer or your use of specific files. It can have multiple actions, so it is one of the most frustrating viruses to deal with.","<strong>6. Direct Action Virus</strong><br/>Although it was once a devastating form of virus, this type is not as common as was in the past. It is only active upon execution of the file or program it is attached to. Once the program is not in use, the virus no longer runs its operations. Most security programs are good at detecting these types of viruses.","<strong>7. Boot Sector Virus</strong><br/>This type of computer virus was more common when floppy disks were popular for booting a computer. While they are not as common today, this type of virus still exits and causes problems. If your computer is infected with a boot sector virus, it will run its operations when you start it up. The program is tied to the boot menu.","<strong>8. Web Scripting Virus</strong><br/>These viruses come from the programming used for a site&#39;s display. The image placement, videos, links and layout of a site are all constructed with coding. This can be altered with the intent of infecting your computer when you click links or watch videos on a malicious site. A site may unknowingly host malicious codes added by a third party, so be careful about visiting any sites. Good security programs have features that detect malicious sites while you browse the Internet.","<strong>9. Memory Resident Virus</strong><br/>This form of computer virus is very destructive. It embeds itself in the computer&#39;s memory to carry out operations. This means whenever you run your operating system, the virus is working. It has varying effects, but it will clear up space on your computer for its own use by corrupting and deleting your files.","<strong>10. FAT Virus</strong><br/>FAT viruses ruin your file allocation system, which is where information about files and where to find them exists. It even destroys files and the entire directories for them.","Most types of viruses today only work on Windows operating systems, but there are many for Android, Macintosh, iOS and even Blackberry. To avoid these destructive viruses, you must always have a good security program for optimal computer protection. While there are free options, they come with only minimal protection and require manual updates. Since viruses change quickly and are a constant threat, you always face a greater risk using the basic free programs. Keep in mind that even the most trusted sites may still have vulnerabilities, and security breaches in the past have resulted in devastating effects for many Internet users.","When it comes to the <a href=\"/best-computer-protection-software\">best computer protection</a>, several programs meet the steepest challenges. They scan downloads and sites in advance. They offer malware detection and removal, block outside attempts to access your device and have many additional benefits. The peace of mind they offer is worth every cent."]},"id":"c67d6bf9-0318-4c6b-9899-5641210d2618","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_9150","url":"/top-10-worst-types-of-computer-viruses","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-23T22:43:34Z","datePublished":"2015-02-23T22:43:34Z","name":"Top 10 Worst Types Of Computer Viruses","synopsis":"In today's virtual world, there are many security threats in the form of computer viruses.
