However, prices vary quite a bit based on power and size. For example, the powerful commercial dehydrators favored by hunters, fishermen and avid gardeners can cost as much as $300. ","<strong>Can You Really Save Money With A Food Dehydrator?</strong>","Yes, for quite a few reasons, according to an online <a href=\"https://budgeting.thenest.com/food-dehydrators-save-money-31636.html\">article</a> published by The Nest.","Citing the National Resources Defense Council, author Steve Lander says the typical American family throws away about 25 percent of the food it buys. Dehydrating food can save you money by preventing food waste. Lander mentions beef jerky and fruit leather as examples, both of which many people enjoy as snacks.","“These products are usually very expensive on a per unit basis, since you usually only eat a couple of ounces at a time. Plus, if you&#39;re buying them at convenience stores, you pay an even higher markup, but if you make your own, you can bypass this expense,” Landers says.","Dehydrating food also helps you save money by making it worth buying in bulk or on sale. You can then preserve the food for use when costs are higher. Further, other than the initial drying time, dehydrated foods don’t require electricity for preservation like those that need to be frozen or refrigerated.","Another benefit is you control what goes into your dehydrated foods, so you’ll likely eat healthier and may save on medical costs. You can save even more money if you grow your own fruits and vegetables to dehydrate.","<strong>Further Information</strong>","Food dehydrators are a smart and thrifty way to extend your grocery budget, and they let you keep plenty of easily stored food on hand, according to Cathy Merrill. She would know, as an Extension Assistant Professor of Family and Consumer Sciences for the Utah County Extension Office of Utah State University. &#34;I like dehydrators because they are a safe, easy way of preserving food,&#34; she said. &#34;Dehydrated foods are easy to pack, they don&#39;t take much space and, usually, dehydrators are not very expensive.&#34;","Dehydrators also let you preserve foods the way you want.  Dried banana chips made at home often are healthier because typically the store-bought chips have been fried in coconut oil and have added sugar, she said."]},"id":"5ca2fc2f-2021-481c-8e6c-b6225120d551","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/KPWfbvYPe3y95u842WdAV7.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/food-dehydrators/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9RL0YvNzU2NTE5L29yaWdpbmFsL0Zvb2QtRGVoeWRyYXRvcnMtTmVzY28tRkQtNzVBLVNuYWNrTWFzdGVyLVByby0wMTcuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KPWfbvYPe3y95u842WdAV7.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"KPWfbvYPe3y95u842WdAV7","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KPWfbvYPe3y95u842WdAV7.jpg","alt":""},"id":"737526c7-30fb-4c86-8fdc-26eeace532ea","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/>Dehydrating food poses less risk of illness. &#34;You are safer with dehydrating things compared to any other preservation method because it&#39;s simple,&#34; Merrill said. &#34;The kids can help with it.
