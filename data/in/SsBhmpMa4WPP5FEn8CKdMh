The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/computers/peripherals/best-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse/\">Wireless Keyboards and Mice</a> here</em>","With a shape and weight that’s like a contoured skipping stone, the Logitech Ultrathin T630 is easily the smallest and thinnest Bluetooth mouse we reviewed. It tested well on each surface and has up to nine functional gestures on its touch-sensitive surface. If you’re always on the move with your laptop, it’s a perfect choice. You don’t even need a laptop bag because it’s small enough to store in your pants pocket.","We tested the cursor response accuracy on various surfaces by tracing a number of shapes and counting the number of times the cursor lagged and ventured beyond the shape&#39;s edges. In our testing, the T630 had excellent scores on surfaces like laminate and carpet. Laminate is the most important because it&#39;s the most common desktop surface.","The mouse doesn’t have adjustable resolution. Its optical laser has a resolution of 1,000 dpi, which is the most common resolution setting for a mouse. This means the cursor response sensitivity is what you&#39;d expect with a mouse built for average home users. Without adjustable resolution, you can&#39;t customize the response sensitivity to your tasks, though this is an advanced feature.","The mouse has one button, which is the entire surface, but it also has nine touch-sensitive gestures. Most Bluetooth mice only have four or five functions. Clicking feels different from other wireless mice we tested because the entire surface clicks down. It&#39;s not as sensitive as other mice, but it is easy to get used to.","Most of the touch-sensitive gestures are optimized for Windows 8 and Macintosh computers, but the basic functions like scrolling and zooming still work with Windows 7 and Windows XP. You can&#39;t program any of the gestures to perform different tasks, like copying and pasting text.","Elsewhere, Bluetooth channel switching support and a rechargeable battery are strong value-friendly additions for the T630. While its manufacturer-rated battery life is a modest 10 days, rechargeable batteries are a feature commonly found on more expensive competitors. The Ultrathin’s USB port is placed in an inconvenient location on the bottom of the mouse, which means you can’t use the T630 while it’s charging.","In our hands-on testing, we found that the Ultrathin T630 has a sleek shape and solid, balanced feel. This gives it the advantage of being very portable and allows it to slide across surfaces with ease. The mouse can slide into pockets or backpack sleeves without any issues or bulging. However, this also means that the mouse is a less-than-comfortable fit for a palm grip or a claw grip. The mouse buttons have a comfortable degree of travel, but because of its miniscule dimensions, it feels downright petite if you have large hands. The T630 is still excellent and comfortable to use, but the mouse can be an adjustment versus comparable home and office mice.","The Ultrathin T630 comes with a lengthy three-year warranty. You can contact support through phone, email or social networks. You can also download firmware and manuals and access a FAQs page for additional help.","The Logitech Ultrathin T630 is one of the best Bluetooth mice available because it combines great cursor accuracy on a wide range of surfaces with comprehensive functionality and portability. The rechargeable battery is an excellent feature, and it charges quickly."]},"id":"f02f01a9-807b-44f9-b1a3-c84ce9d0d2ba","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69392","url":"/logitech-ultrathin-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2017-05-30T13:43:38Z","datePublished":"2017-05-30T13:43:38Z","name":"Logitech Ultrathin T630","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":24,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-08-12T00:00:00Z","id":"SsBhmpMa4WPP5FEn8CKdMh","meta":{"title":"Logitech Ultrathin Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The Logitech Ultrathin T630 is an ideal wireless mouse for mobile users.
