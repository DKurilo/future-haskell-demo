In fact, when you first open the hair clipper’s box, you must charge it. To properly amp up the battery’s life, Conair recommends charging the unit and then using it until it dies three different times. These charging and discharging cycles will allow the battery to obtain a full charge, lasting about 75 minutes. Once you’ve completed this cycle, you don’t have to fully charge the unit if you don’t want to. You can do a 15-minute quick charge to gain about 15 minutes of use. The charging indicator will flash when it needs to be recharged. Just remember that in order to maintain the lithium ion battery, you must run the electric razor completely out of battery at least every six months and then recharged the unit to full power for three hours.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56702-conair1.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bGraZRn9BSUyVn4EXFQ7uA.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"bGraZRn9BSUyVn4EXFQ7uA","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bGraZRn9BSUyVn4EXFQ7uA.jpg","alt":""},"id":"53cc9080-2268-4bda-ab46-f5b9495088bf","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Under the hood, the Conair HC1100 has a high-powered motor that is powerful enough for even the toughest hair.

One of our favorite sections of Conair’s website is their tips and techniques page where they give you helpful grooming tricks. Many of the tips include how best to use the Conair HC110 hair clipper. For example, Conair recommends to always shave against the grain. Whichever the direction the hair is growing on your head, shave the opposite way. Even better, if you&#39;re shaving your head bald, Conair suggests its best to use a pre-shave lotion to prevent your head from drying out.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/56702-conair3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ypM5ChNJq8FPN9xQuqRZi.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"4ypM5ChNJq8FPN9xQuqRZi","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ypM5ChNJq8FPN9xQuqRZi.jpg","alt":""},"id":"e6235c1f-edde-487e-b14e-297a2267e9cf","type":"image"},{"data":{"path":"/XgNeDhK4JF5DbrCYXDm5f3.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Whether you’re going bald and would like an easy solution or you’re ready for a nice and cool summer hair cut, Conair will treat you right.
