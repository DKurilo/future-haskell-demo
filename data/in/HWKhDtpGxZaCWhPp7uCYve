The average price of the ranges we reviewed is $1,334. That may seem like a lot, but since it is a major appliance you use daily, it’s smart to consider features, burner style, and oven size and features along with the price.","<strong>Why Trust Us?</strong>","We&#39;ve spent more than 160 hours evaluating what makes a great slide-in range and comparing different models’ features side by side. We considered both electric and gas models, and in addition to our online research, we relied on our own knowledge and experiences to evaluate these products.","<strong>How We Researched</strong>","To start, we read amateur and professional reviews to help us decide which ranges to compare. Then, we watched instructional videos and scoured manuals to understand how the most important features work. Since customer service is important, we also contacted manufacturers to see how politely and quickly their representatives respond to customers. Further, we scrutinized the specs on many slide-in ranges, including cooktop capabilities, controls, oven sizes, self-cleaning system types, warming or storage drawer inclusions, and more. Based on the information we found, we narrowed our selection to the best gas and electric slide-in ranges.","<strong>Benefits of Owning a Slide-In Range</strong>","Slide-in ranges differ from the widely popular freestanding models in several ways. For example, slide-in ranges typically cost more, and many people find them more attractive. Unlike freestanding ranges, slide-in models don’t have a backguard, and their controls are always located on the front – a potential problem if you have young children. However, when you cook, it&#39;s nice to not have to reach across hot pans to adjust settings. Slide-in ranges also have an extra couple of inches on the top that overlap the counters on either side.","&#34;One of the main benefits to the overlap is cleanability. Food and crumbs can’t drip down the sides like it can with a freestanding,&#34; according to Danny Nguyen, writing in a blog sponsored by Yale Appliance, which operates in Massachusetts. &#34;Also, when you push a slide-in range all the way back, there is about a 2” space behind the range. You fill this with countertop material. This allows a built-in look and the capability of being able to showcase your backsplash since there isn’t a backguard blocking it like a freestanding unit.”","So, should you buy a gas or electric slide-in range? Both have advantages, especially when it comes to their cooktops. Electric-range enthusiasts love the aesthetic of a sleek glass cooktop as well as the fact that the smooth surface is easy to wipe clean. But people who love using gas cooktops praise their superior temperature control.","&#34;An electric cooktop needs to warm up, whereas the heat from a gas cooktop is immediate once you turn on the flame. When you need high heat, however, electric cooktops heat food faster and can get hotter than gas cooktops,&#34; states SFGate, an online publication that is associated with the San Francisco Chronicle.","<strong>How to Choose a Slide-In Range</strong>","Cooktop Features<br/>Some people prefer glass electric cooktops because they look sleek and are easy to clean. However, others like how much they can control temperature on a gas stove, even if the grates are harder to clean. Burner sizes don&#39;t vary too widely, but keep an eye out for especially big ones if you use oversize pots and pans.","Oven Capabilities<br/>Oven size can make a big difference if you use yours often. If you have a large family or like to entertain big groups, consider a slide-in range with a large interior. It is also worth noting the number of included oven racks as well as how many positions you can slide them into for baking, braising and broiling.","Extras<br/>If you want a self-cleaning oven, consider whether you prefer one that steam cleans or one that heat cleans. In addition, some slide-in ranges have a warming drawer instead of a storage drawer for pans. If you observe Judaism’s sabbath rules, consider a range with a Sabbath mode, which can keep food warm so you don&#39;t have to cook.","<strong>Can You Replace a Slide-In Range With a Drop-In Range?</strong>","Drop-in ranges can definitely fit in place of a slide-in-range, but keep in mind that they are much more costly and will require a lot more planning. They are built into customized cabinetry, so you’ll need to find a carpenter or woodworker who can create and install the surrounding cabinets and countertops for you. Before purchasing a drop-in range, make sure you have the space for it and know exactly where you want to place it. This is a big investment so you’ll want to make the process as painless as possible. We recommend getting multiple bids from different contractors to help save money as well. If you’re wanting a cheaper range option, we suggest you look at freestanding <a href=\"/best-electric-cooktop-ranges\">electric cooktop ranges</a> or <a href=\"/best-gas-ranges\">gas ranges</a>."]},"id":"10d91b7d-d4e3-4b26-a53c-0c4cb59e4494","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"1a6e59d2-8879-454c-931a-8de7a9bba7db","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/samsung-review\">Samsung NE58F9710WS</a>","<a href=\"/samsung-nx58k9500wg-review\">Samsung NX58K9500WG/AA</a>","<a href=\"/whirlpool-review\">Whirlpool WEE745H0FS</a>","<a href=\"/whirlpool-wec310s0fb-review\">Whirlpool WEC310S0FB</a>","<a href=\"/whirlpool-wee510s0fs-review\">Whirlpool WEE510S0FS</a>","<a href=\"/lg-electronics-review\">LG LSE4611ST</a>","<a href=\"/kenmore-review\">Kenmore 42539</a>","<a href=\"/bosch-review\">Bosch HEIPO54U</a>","<a href=\"/frigidaire-ffgs3026tw-review\">Frigidaire FFGS3026TW </a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"1a9707cc-27d4-4152-b6f4-e913ca8ec8d6","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_183","url":"/best-slide-in-ranges","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-22T15:17:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-22T15:17:00Z","name":"Best Slide-In Ranges of 2019","synopsis":"Slide-in ranges are multifunctional appliances that are designed to sit flush with your countertops and fit neatly between them.","review":{},"strapline":"Slide-in ranges are multifunctional appliances that are designed to sit flush with your countertops and fit neatly between them.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-23T23:12:44Z","id":"HWKhDtpGxZaCWhPp7uCYve","meta":{"title":"Best Slide-In Ranges 2019 -
