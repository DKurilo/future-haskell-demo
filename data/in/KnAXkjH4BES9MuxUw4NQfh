You can customize this DIY alarm monitoring system with a variety of equipment, alerts and monitoring services. NextAlarm&#39;s customer support offers a small selection of tutorials and optional installation services.","The equipment selection for NextAlarm is rather weak when compared to the other manufacturers in our review. The system is not compatible with panic buttons, garage door sensors, recessed door sensors or any type of home automation equipment. However, you can choose from a limited selection of security cameras, sirens, door and window sensors, security key fobs, and motion sensors. NextAlarm states that its motion sensors are pet-immune but does not state a specific weight limit.","All of the equipment uses wireless technology to communicate with the control panel. You can purchase a starter kit from NextAlarm, but only after it directs you to a third-party retail website. This is the only company in our review that doesn&#39;t sell equipment directly.","The NextAlarm system uses your monitoring subscription and a number of emergency alerts to protect your family from harm. When an alert occurs, NextAlarm contacts you to see if it&#39;s a false alarm and then contacts the authorities if appropriate. The alerts that work with NextAlarm each require a hardware component such as a smoke detector or motion sensor. The alerts that work with this system include intrusion, smoke, fire, carbon monoxide, medical, flood and power failure. NextAlarm does not support temperature change or natural gas leak alerts.","NextAlarm offers two DIY alarm monitoring service plans: Self Monitoring and Professional Monitoring. Each plan requires a no-contract monthly payment, gives you notifications and includes internet-connected monitoring. The Professional Monitoring plan also includes 24-hour monitoring and alarm status reports. For an additional fee, you can add NextView video service to either monitoring plan. This allows you watch the live feed from your security cameras using a browser or smartphone app.","For system support as you begin the DIY installation process, you can download manuals, view tutorials and read FAQs. NextAlarm can connect you with a certified installer in your area, though this costs extra. The system has a one-year equipment warranty. Although NextAlarm doesn&#39;t offer a live chat support feature, you can contact customer support agents via email and telephone."]},"id":"449dd94b-c56d-4e80-aa60-f70e1e3cc11a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"17c4ff9b-604c-4fb7-a55f-80f57974c0af","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["NextAlarm&#39;s DIY home monitoring system has a passable equipment selection, adequate alerts and fine customer service.
