The drive sports a durable rubber casing that protects your data from shock, water and physical damage. These attributes place this pen drive in the rugged category, so it would be an ideal option if you lead a physically demanding lifestyle.","The memory stick is available in 8GB, 16GB, 32GB and 64GB memory capacities, and all versions have plug-and-play functionality. As with all USB 3.0 compatible flash drives, the Boost XT is backwards compatible with USB 2.0, and this memory stick works with Windows, Linux 2.4 and Mac operating systems. Although file transfer speeds of this model will be faster than drives with 2.0 technology or older, this drive won&#39;t be winning many races among its USB 3.0 peers. Its 16GB version reads at up to 90MB per second and writes at 30MB/s.","While the extreme durability of this USB flash drive is helpful, it is still missing some useful and important features. The USB stick does not include any security software. This means that you will be unable to encrypt your data or protect certain files with a password. Likewise, Patriot does not provide any online storage with which to back up your files in case of flash drive failure. Another handy feature this drive lacks is an indicator light that illuminates during file transfers. The pen drive does, however, have a convenient loop through which you can attach a lanyard or key chain.","Patriot Memory&#39;s website offers support for its products. There, you can take a product tour, download items such as fix tools, and read FAQs and community forums. If you need technical support beyond the questions that have already been answered in the forums, you can contact Patriot via email or with a toll-free telephone call. The Boost XT comes with a five-year warranty."]},"id":"34c10515-82e3-4c61-9c09-7ec0443ef289","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"19e88376-00be-4180-a4b0-3de6a0388c80","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Patriot Supersonic Boost XT is a perfect USB 3.0 flash drive if you need a basic, no-fuss drive that is also extremely durable.
