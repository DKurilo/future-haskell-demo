Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you are in the market for a <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-printers,review-2026.html\">laser printer</a> that best fits in your home, the Dell 1355cnw may have the features and tools you are looking for. This laser printer offers a variety of features to its users, but it lacks the power to handle large offices and extensive printing. It is an energy-efficient device and offers small dimensions, which are both advantages for a home printer. In addition, the Dell 1355cnw not only prints but also offers fax, copy and scanning capabilities.","The Dell 1355cnw offers simple, yet effective, printing features. The maximum resolution offered on this printing device is 600 x 600 dpi (dots per inch). This resolution is not the highest available on a laser printer but still provides clear and sharp prints. This printer also has a 30,000 monthly duty cycle. This cycle is adequate for home use, but for a large office you will reach 30,000 pages before you may realize it.","This laser printer doesn’t offer fast print speeds, which is a drawback to this device. You can print black and white documents at a speed of 15 pages per minutes and color documents at a speed of 12 pages per minute. If you are printing large documents, you may be waiting quite some time for your print job to be complete with this laser printer.","With the ability to fax, copy and scan on this laser printer, you can get much done with little effort. The paper tray on the 1355cnw holds up to 150 sheets of paper, along with a 10-sheet bypass tray. This is not a large amount of paper, especially with copying, scanning and faxing capabilities, and you may find yourself restocking the paper tray on a regular basis.","The Dell1355cnw is Wi-Fi compatible, which allows for wireless printing. This is a standout feature and takes away the hassle of dealing with cords or other connectivity options. You can also use the Ethernet capabilities, which is ideal for networking. A USB 2.0 port is also located on the device for additional connectivity options. In addition, this laser printer is compatible with several operating systems such as Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP and Mac OS 10.4 or later.","We were surprised by the outstanding design of the 1355cnw. This printer features small dimensions, a lightweight but sturdy feel, and still offers scanning, faxing and copying capabilities. The control panel is located on the top of the printer and it features 34 buttons for controlling and navigating around the device. With so many buttons, it is more difficult to navigate around the device and to tell the device what to do. An LCD screen is located on the panel to help you work all the features offered on the 1355cnw."]},"id":"37d6f5a7-0a7e-4b78-8266-58ed1bf5b483","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2a2a23bf-25b6-4f86-9712-5cf274ce74c5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>Dell 1355cnw</strong> is a multifunctional laser printer filled with features.
