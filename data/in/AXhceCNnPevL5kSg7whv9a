Active Junky tested sleeping bags on multiple camping trips in Utah and Colorado, and the Marmot Helium 15 was a favorite from the beginning, and after all the trips, it was declared the best men’s backpacking sleeping bag.","The 800-fill power goose down provides excellent insulation, and the Down Defender system protects it from wet conditions. The shell is made of Pertex nylon, and the shell is DWR-treated nylon. Combined with a multi-baffle hood to hold in warmth, this sleeping bag is rated for temperatures as low as 15 degrees Fahrenheit.","Despite this, it weighs just over two pounds, making it an excellent choice for long hikes or situations where weight is a key consideration. By comparison, the heaviest sleeping bags weight 11 pounds, and an average bag for backpacking is under five pounds.","The baffles on the sleeping bag are both curved and contoured, which kept the down in place and prevented cold spots even when used multiple nights. The Active Junky testers were also impressed by the sipper, which did not snag like many models do. Marmot uses two-way slide sippers with a special zipper guide to prevent snagging. It also has a draft tube to keep cold air from entering along the zipper line.","The Helium 15 offers a two-zipper system. The second “fold-down” zipper lets you open up part of the bag so that you don’t overheat on warm nights. This makes it a good sleeping bag for three seasons.","<strong>Tester Comment: </strong>Float me away, Helium.  Few hoods match this one for fit, comfort and warmth.  And the baffle system is a big leap ahead compared to competitive bags<br/><strong>Key Feature:</strong> Versatile<br/><strong>Best For:</strong> Investing in a bag to do it all. Enjoying a warm sleeping bag that compresses down to a manageable size.<br/><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Warm, compact and comfortable, the Marmot Helium 15 is an excellent 3-season sleeping bag that works well for long backpacking trips as well as car camping."]},"id":"0307eaa7-9289-45f5-82c1-e71590f1783b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68156","url":"/marmot-helium-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-02T18:56:50Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T18:56:50Z","name":"Marmot Helium","synopsis":"If you’re looking for a sleeping bag that can handle the coldest of nights, whether winter hiking in the mountains or dealing with the frigid mornings in the desert, the Marmot Helium 15 provide","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"If you’re looking for a sleeping bag that can handle the coldest of nights, whether winter hiking in the mountains or dealing with the frigid mornings in the desert, the Marmot Helium 15 provide","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-08-02T19:59:38Z","id":"AXhceCNnPevL5kSg7whv9a","meta":{"title":"Marmot Helium Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Marmot Helium 15 is a 3-season sleeping bag that&#8217;s warm, water-resistant and light.
