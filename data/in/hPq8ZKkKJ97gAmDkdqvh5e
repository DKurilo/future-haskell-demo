However, it can be hard to pay several hundred dollars for a GoPro, the big name in action cameras, so budget-friendly replicas offer you comparable performance without busting your wallet. The EK7000 is an immense value, comes with tons of accessories and is ideal for brightly lit scenarios.","The AKASO EK7000 works decently well <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">underwater</a>. You can dive down to 98 feet in water and it will still work, though you’ll need to first secure it in its waterproof casing. Only the <a href=\"/nikon-w300-review\">Nikon W300</a> can go deeper. In our underwater and dry-land tests, the EK7000 produces decent photos, earning a score of B- from us. It’s enough to capture moments on an adventure, but they likely won’t be the clear and sharp ones you were hoping for. Furthermore, the manufacturer doesn’t specify any dustproof, shockproof or freezeproof ratings, so use it with caution when you’re in those kinds of scenarios.","With the AKASO, you can shoot both photos and video. The EK7000 has a 12-megapixel sensor, which in both our underwater and dry land tests shot fairly good images. It’s easy to look through them on the bright display. You can also opt to shoot video up to 4K at 25 frames per second (fps) or 2.7K at 30fps, though there are several resolution options available below those as well. The included 2.4G wrist remote lets you set up the AKASO on a tripod and take a burst photo or time-lapse exactly when you want. The remote also lets you control the framing of a shot or switch to video.","And with built-in Wi-Fi, you can easily share your images on your favorite social media site within moments of taking them. You’ll have to download the companion mobile app, called iSmart DV, which is available for both tablets and smartphones. The AKASO comes with two interchangeable and rechargeable 1050mAh batteries and a dual-slot charger dock. It also ships with a ton of accessories, including a variety of mounts, straps and a cleaning cloth, and you can even use certain GoPro accessories with it if you want."]},"id":"7dfe406d-e07f-4de0-924b-81ea64c1fae8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70138","url":"/akaso-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-08-08T16:06:24Z","datePublished":"2018-08-08T16:06:24Z","name":"AKASO EK7000","synopsis":"Action cameras like the AKASO EK7000 have become super popular lately, as they can easily capture any kind of adventure, from parkour to a cycling marathon.","review":{"rating":64,"verdict":"With its attractive price point and wireless upload ability, the AKASO EK7000 is a great budget action cam option.","pros":["It can shoot 4K video with sound."],"cons":["Despite its good specs, it struggled to take quality photos and video."]},"strapline":"Action cameras like the AKASO EK7000 have become super popular lately, as they can easily capture any kind of adventure, from parkour to a cycling marathon.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-08-10T00:00:00Z","id":"hPq8ZKkKJ97gAmDkdqvh5e","meta":{"title":"AKASO Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
