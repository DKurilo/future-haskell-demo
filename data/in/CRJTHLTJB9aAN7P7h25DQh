The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/software/education/best-mac-typing-software/\">Mac Typing Software</a> here.</em>","Roller Typing is Mac typing software from EdVenture Software, Inc. that teaches you how to type while making it entertaining. Your on-screen character performs rollerblading tricks after you type the correct keys. This Mac typing software makes learning simple enough that a child can excel, but challenging enough to engage older typists as well.","Multiple people can use Roller Typing. It’s easy to add users with the clearly marked buttons “New Blader” and “Saved Blader.” As you increase your speed and accuracy, you can make your way into Star Row and Z-Hall of Fame.","As you complete each exercise, you can look at a progress report that shows you how quickly you’re typing and what is your accuracy. You can also see a report that displays a right and left hand, with information about how accurately each finger types. On that report, you can see which keys you’re best at typing and which ones you need more practice typing.","This Mac typing software comes with sound effects, such as mooing cows, and background music. If you don’t like the sound, you can turn it off in the options section. You can’t change the volume level in the software; instead, you must change it through your computer settings.","Roller Typing comes with 20 typing levels and five events. It doesn’t come with any typing tips, practice articles or typing tests, though. Each level of Roller Typing teaches you new keys. In the lessons, you’ll learn the letters, numbers and punctuation symbols on your keyboard. It doesn’t include 10-key lessons. This Mac typing software has timed and non-timed exercises and games. As you learn the keys, you can apply your knowledge to participate in events such as rollerblading in between orange cones, jumping over cows, speed rollerblading and doing flips on a half pipe.","Roller Typing is easy to install and use. The navigation is simple, allowing you to begin as a new user or select from the names of rollerblading typists already entered into the system. The menu is clearly marked along the top and bottom of the screen. It’s easy to identify which keys you’ll learn in each of the levels with the concise level menu. You can also keep track of the number of lives you have left in the event you’re playing from the rollerblade icons at the bottom of the screen. The bottom of the screen also houses a diagram that shows you which finger should type the key on the screen. If you have questions, you can click on the Instructions section of the application.","This Mac keyboarding software website only has basic information. EdVenture Software, Inc. has a FAQs page for Windows and Mac operating systems. If you have specific questions that the FAQs don’t cover, you can email the manufacturer at the email address listed on their website. Their company’s response time was one of the fastest of all the products we reviewed. Roller Typing doesn’t have a telephone number for tech support on their website, but they did include a telephone number along with their email response."]},"id":"a887da45-d244-453a-8efd-ef862f73a2e9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a62b73ae-8eef-4344-b477-eee720f2ee22","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Mac typing software has good instruction, but it is missing practice articles and typing tests, which can help you to further strengthen your skills and teach you how to perform well under pressure.
