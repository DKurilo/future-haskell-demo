This annoying quirk makes Hero DVD challenging to navigate if you don&#39;t have prior experience with DVD player software.","An even bigger problem-we could not get the program to play an actual DVD disk. Hero DVD Player 3.0.5 will only play DVD files. This means that in order to play your DVDs you must copy them to your computer first. This is not only inconvenient, but also deceptive for a program titled &#34;DVD Player.&#34; Most DVDs are encrypted with technology that does not allow the user to copy DVD files to their hard drive without breaking the laws.","When we were finally successful in getting the trial software version (General Hero DVD Player) to work, the DVD video portion only played for five minutes while the audio continued. This failed process was frustrating and must be sorted out before we can recommend Hero DVD.
