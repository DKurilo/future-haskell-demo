More basic devices transmit and receive information in only the 2.4GHz range of frequencies, as is the case with the ZyXEL NWD270N. There are a couple of notable drawbacks to this limitation. Most significantly for most users is the potential for interference. The 2.4GHz range is crowded with numerous wireless devices including those that use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and radio frequency remote controls such as those employed by wireless toys. The range is also susceptible to interference from common household appliances, particularly microwave ovens.","While the 2.4GHz band is capable of transferring high bandwidth data like streaming high definition video programming and voice applications like internet phone calling, it is far less capable of this tasking than is the 5GHz range. Additionally, maximum data throughput for the ZyXEL is limited to 150Mbps under ideal circumstances. This doesn’t compare very favorably to the 300Mbps that is available for most products in this review site.","That said, the device offers the Wi-Fi Multimedia feature, WMM, which allows for the prioritization of network traffic. This will go a long way toward assigning the correct priority to data so that the most time sensitive information gets though without interference from that which is less important. The device also uses MIMO technology, Multiple-input/Multiple-output to maximize effective range and to drastically reduce dead spots compared to previous wireless products."]},"id":"693097d1-346d-492f-b0c6-31ac9be71f6e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Security"},"id":"2215bcca-cd6f-46dc-aef5-427b49d1a453","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Security is among the most important features of a wireless network. It’s critical to keep unauthorized users from exploiting the Wi-Fi connection to the internet and, probably more critically, to protect one’s private information. The ZyXEL wireless adapter uses several layers of protection to accomplish these tasks. Most basic of these is Wired Equivalent Privacy, a still-valuable but flawed holdover from first generation Wi-Fi products. More importantly, two iterations of Wi-Fi Protected Access, WPA and WPA2, are employed. WPA keeps communications over a wireless network private using the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol, TKIP. The most significant encryption protocol is added with WPA2 and is known as Advanced Encryption Standard. To date, there is no known incident of AES encryption having been broken by hackers."]},"id":"c5f2f432-e852-4b61-8534-ebf102b1205a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"b19096f2-aa50-4226-8dde-bf785606ce15","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The adapter is equipped with Wi-Fi Protected Setup functionality.
