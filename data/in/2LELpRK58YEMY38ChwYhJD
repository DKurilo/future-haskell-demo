You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Casa Endeavor is a <a href=\"/best-ceiling-fans\">ceiling fan</a> that combines a modern and sleek appearance with a powerful motor. It not only achieves an incredible amount of airflow, but it does so with a high level of energy efficiency. This fan’s quality design, five-blade system and quiet motor helps to reduce your electrical bills through both simple operation and by helping circulate air to better maintain temperatures in a room.","This best ceiling fan with lights sports an incredibly trendy look with matte black blade and motor finishing. The unit comes with three 40-watt candelabra bulbs that fit into fixtures covered by an etched opal glass lighting kit to give it that sophisticated and contemporary appearance. The appearance of this fan creates a perfect convergence of form and function, utilizing high-quality manufacturing parts with a sleek and modern design that will complement most any home.","The quiet ceiling fan utilizes a five-blade design, each blade being 52-inches in length and angled at a 14-degree blade pitch. This assists in achieving its maximum airflow level of 6,396 cubic feet per minute, among the highest levels achievable at its price point. While at the highest speed setting, the fan uses 63.1 watts for a maximum airflow efficiency of 101 cubic feet per minute per watt.","Most of the top ceiling fans are designed to accommodate a downrod, a feature that encourages better airflow by providing more space above the fan to pull air. The included downrod with this fan provides six inches of clearance from the ceiling for a fan height of up to 15 inches. It doesn’t come with a flush mounting kit, which means you’ll need to mount it on a high ceiling to achieve the desired minimum height of seven feet above the floor. While this puts the fan out of arm’s reach for changing its speeds, the fan comes with a remote control for you to switch between its multiple speeds with relative ease.","The Casa Vieja Endeavor is a reliable and powerful ceiling fan, sporting a trendy and modern appearance with an efficient five-blade design to achieve incredible levels of air circulation. Its effective design is further complemented by a high level of airflow efficiency that is facilitated by its vertical footprint. This fan not only conveys the appearance of a high-end modern fan, but it also delivers incredible levels of airflow for a variety of room sizes."]},"id":"393234d4-0d46-458a-abaa-684a83de75b7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66302","url":"/casa-endeavor-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-07-22T17:01:52Z","datePublished":"2015-07-22T17:01:52Z","name":"Casa Vieja Endeavor","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-07-22T17:01:52Z","id":"2LELpRK58YEMY38ChwYhJD","meta":{"title":"Casa Vieja Endeavor Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
