The Dacor Renaissance EF36IWF has a total capacity of 19.9 cubic feet and has a through-the-door ice and water dispenser. The fresh food section has a capacity of 14.9 cubic feet, which is average for a fridge of this size. This counter-depth french door refrigerator will stay flush with standard cabinetry since it has a depth of just 36 inches.","In the fresh food compartment, you have two crisper bins that are perfect for fruits and vegetables where you can control the humidity to suit the produce you put in them. The deli drawer spans the width of the fridge, and you can control the temperature of the drawer so that you can thaw out frozen goods or store large items. The fresh food compartment has five shelves, four of which are split and can be placed at different height levels. However, one of the four shelves is less than half as big as the others because it makes room for the icemaker in the refrigerator compartment. Rather than wasting space, the Dacor Renaissance fridge does have this half-shelf, but it can fit very little on it.","The door storage is also limited. Technically, you have seven door bins, but two of those bins are only large enough for one can of soda or other small item. Of the other five bins, one is a dairy compartment with a clear door so that you can peer inside. There are also two gallon-sized bins, which is nice for storing milk, juice and other large bottles. The last two bins are narrow and don&#39;t have a lot of space for more than a few condiments.","While other models may have it on the inside, this french door fridge has the control panel on the door as part of the water and ice dispenser. The icemaker in the fresh food section makes the ice for this external dispenser, which is the reason why the shelving is limited in the compartment as well as on the door. The fridge comes in an attractive stainless steel finish, and the control panel has a blue LCD screen and a blue light in the dispenser for cohesiveness. You do have to purchase the door handles separately, but you have two styles to from which to choose."]},"id":"c4480b70-5677-40b6-85d7-882324adec30","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7fb4e5c5-bd6a-473e-bd88-eb6c7ef14b18","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dacor Renaissance french door refrigerator has a through-the-door water and ice dispenser, humidity-controlled bins and a temperature-controlled drawer, but the storage space in the fresh food compartment is limited.
