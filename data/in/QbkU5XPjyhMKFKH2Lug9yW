It can print both black-and-white and color prints quickly and at a high resolution. This laser printer is a rare combination of color printing capability, resolution and speed.","The Lexmark CS 410dtn boasts high-resolution prints, especially for how fast this printer pumps out pages. If you are printing a high-resolution image, the resolution can be bumped up to 2,400 dots per inch (dpi) from 1,200 dpi for a sharper image print; but for general operation, it runs best at 1,200 dpi.","This is one of the few color laser printers that can print above 30 pages per minute. Most color laser printers compromise speed for resolution, but this is not the case for the Lexmark CS 410dtn. It achieves 32 black-and-white or color pages per minute.","This printer is a workhorse, boasting a monthly duty cycle of 75,000 prints. This means that the printer can withstand up to 75,000 prints a month before it experiences any signs of wear and tear. The ink cartridge that comes standard with this laser printer doesn&#39;t boast the same longevity, having a mediocre toner yield. Lexmark does offer toner cartridges with higher yields, which are more costly initially but save you on replacement costs in the long run.","You can cut the cost of paper in half by printing on both sides of the paper, also known as duplex printing. When duplex printing, the Lexmark CS 410dtn can print up to 15 pages per minute. Lexmark continues to cut costs by being ENERGY STAR certified, so you won&#39;t see rising power bills.","The Lexmark CS 410dtn can hold a lot of paper. It comes standard with a 550-sheet duo tray and includes a 100-sheet multipurpose feeder. This gives the printer the versatility to print media as small as 3 x 5 inches, all the way up to 8.5 x 14 inches. This paper capacity can be expanded to hold another 550-sheet tray. When fully upgraded, this laser printer can hold up to 1,200 sheets of paper. Even with the extra paper tray, this printer is still pretty compact at 17 inches wide and 16 inches high. It does weigh quite a bit, though, almost 55 pounds.","The Lexmark CS color laser printer has 256MB of memory, which isn&#39;t upgradable. However, this is ample memory for most printing jobs.","This Lexmark laser printer is a versatile option for any small office or business. It is compatible with all Windows, Mac, Linux and UNIX operating systems we looked for, as well as a few others. All departments within your small business can connect to this printer via your network.","Lexmark has a live-chat feature. The sidebar link takes you to an online email form for you to fill out and wait for a response. Telephone support is also available, and the Lexmark staff is friendly and willing to help you once you are connected."]},"id":"b9cfb36d-f7d7-474a-afaf-3b5fa1a4710d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"43b83c82-7a29-44f9-a44a-5a78fd121c0a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Lexmark CS 410dtn is a reliable color laser printer for your small business.
