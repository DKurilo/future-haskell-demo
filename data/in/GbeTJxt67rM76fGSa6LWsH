Links on this page will take you to a newer version. We will consider the newest version when we next refresh our reviews of double oven ranges.</em>","The LG LDG3036ST is a <a href=\"/best-double-oven-ranges\">range double oven</a> with several convection cooking modes, a large lower oven, several settings and an attractive design. It also includes self-cleaning capabilities.","This gas-range double oven features convection cooking technology. A small fan is located inside the oven that circulates the hot air, which cooks your food faster and more evenly throughout. With this model, you can choose the convection bake or convection roast mode. There is no convection broil mode, but a traditional broil is available on this double oven range.","The cooktop&#39;s burners range from 5,000 to 17,000 Btu. The lower-powered burners are ideal for simmering, and the higher-Btu ones are powerful enough to sear your food.","At 2.2 cubic feet, the upper oven on the LG is much smaller than the lower oven. However, the smaller oven still provides plenty of room for most dishes and features two rack positions. The lower oven is 3.9 cubic feet with five rack positions, giving you a lot of cooking versatility.","The controls on this gas-range double oven are located on the front and back panels. The touch controls on the back panel allow you to control the temperature, time and settings for both ovens. Five knobs that control the stovetop are in the front, so you don&#39;t have to reach over hot food to use them. As for the aesthetics of the design, this LG double oven range features a stainless steel finish, with a porcelain finish for the cooktop.","There are several settings on this LG double oven range. There is a delayed bake option as well as a warming setting, which allows you to keep your food warm without overcooking. The oven also features an automatic shut-off ability to make sure you never leave it on too long. It uses heat to clean itself. However, there is no meat probe for checking the internal temperature of meats such as steak or turkey, which many other ovens do include.","A one-year parts and labor manufacturer warranty covers the LG LDG3036ST. This is the average length of warranty for these ovens, though some are covered for two years or longer. The <a href=\"/maytag-review\">Maytag</a> double oven range has a 10-year parts and labor warranty, which is by far the best warranty of any range in our lineup.","The LG LDG3036ST is a powerful range double oven with convection technology, plenty of cooking space and a versatile cooktop. It also has extra features such as automatic shut-off that make it safer to use."]},"id":"5a774723-52fb-4635-8227-cca15b471eee","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67565","url":"/lg-gas-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-01-14T20:48:52Z","datePublished":"2016-01-14T20:48:52Z","name":"LG LDG 3036ST","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: The LG LDG 3036ST has been discontinued by the manufacturer.
