The remote control attaches magnetically to the top of the unit when not in use so you don't lose it. Unlike most tower fans, the Vornado Tower 184 is a circulator, which means it doesn't oscillate to get better coverage of a room. It must be placed strategically to produce ideal airflow in a room. This means you will feel a stronger air flow across the room than immediately by the fan. The fan is easy to assemble out of the box; you only need to attach the base using four screws. The fan can be difficult to clean, but not more so than the average tower fan.

We conducted hands-on testing and ranked many best-selling tower fans in our review. We also have experience testing humidifiers and air purifiers in our lab, both of which helped inform our conclusions on tower fans.","We contacted manufacturers with questions we had while testing the tower fans. We read dozens of online user and professional reviews. We also talked to professionals and people who use these devices regularly to hear about their experiences using them. Erik Higley from Utah was one such person who has used a tower fan in his home and in his profession. He works in real estate and occasionally fixes up homes to sell and maintains rental properties.","Higley has used his fan during a flood emergency at the school where his wife works and a water pipe leak at one of his rental homes. He loaned his Lasko tower fan to a neighbor whose basement flooded. His neighbor told him it was one of the best of many fans he borrowed to deal with the situation. Higley said it is low maintenance and he has never needed to take it apart to clean it.","Higley has been using the same Lasko tower fan for the better part of a decade and it continues to work well for him. One of the things Higley loves about his tower fan is how it stands on its own. “It fits nicely in the corner but still blows air all over the furniture,” he said. “It’s better than a traditional fan because you don’t have to set it on a table.” In Higley’s experience a fan that moves air at a mid-level, as a tower fan does, is much more effective than a table fan that mostly blows air toward the ground.","Higley said there isn’t anything he doesn’t like about the fan. “I like its portability, efficiency and the ability to take the stand apart for storage.” While he’s only used the one fan and can’t compare it to other brands, he is sold on his Lasko and will use until it doesn’t work anymore, which could be a long time. ","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","As we compared the various models in our review, we looked at the specifications provided by each fan&#39;s manufacturer. However, not all of these companies provide all of the information we looked for. In some cases, as with the Dyson AM07, we have tested tower fans in our lab, but the testing is more subjective in describing how it feels to use the fan. In order to make our reviews more accurate, objective and useful, we are currently conducting a new round of testing involving 10 tower fans in our lab and will share our results after testing wraps up.","In the meantime and based on the current available data, our reviews focus mostly on the power and noise levels of each fan. Powerful fans with a high airflow rating in cubic feet per minute (CFM) did well in our evaluation, since they can move more air within a room. However, a higher CFM rating usually means the fan is louder than weaker models. The tower fans we evaluated aren&#39;t particularly loud, though some models are as loud as 68 decibels (dB), which can be disruptive in bedrooms while you&#39;re trying to sleep, unless you want the fan for white noise.","<strong>What to Look For  <br/></strong><br/>Convenience Features<br/>Most tower fans aren&#39;t too complicated; there are usually oscillation settings that allow them to sweep the air stream side to side within a room, as well as various speed settings and sleep-timer options. All of the tower fans we looked at also come with a remote control, which makes it easier to control the fan from a distance. <br/><br/>Appearance<br/>Although the main reason most people buy a tower fan is to cool down and circulate air, looks sometimes matter. If you care about how a fan fits into your home&#39;s décor, choose a model with a color that complements your tastes. Furthermore, if you find a tower fan unappealing, you might consider buying a <a href=\"/best-ceiling-fans\">ceiling fan</a> instead, though you should be prepared to pay more, especially if you choose not to install it yourself.","Pricing<br/>Tower fans are generally pretty affordable. The bestselling fans on Amazon, Home Depot and Lowes are comparably priced to the ones on our site. In fact, many of those fans are included on our site. The majority of tower are priced $50 to $120. Fans with special features like the Dyson AM07 tower fan are twice as much costing around $350. Dysons have a unique, stylish, multifunctional design. Dyson fans run relatively quiet and are easy to clean and maintain. There’s no denying that they are attractive and effective at fanning the air. Nonetheless, the other fans in our lineup perform at a comparable level for a fraction of the price. There are a lot of options out there, many of them quite affordable. ","Warranty<br/>A long warranty can help you get repairs or a full replacement if your tower fan malfunctions. Our research revealed that most tower fans have a one-year warranty, which is typical among most types of electrical appliances. Three brands we looked at have longer warranties: Vornado, Holmes and Dyson offer five-, three- and two-year warranties on their respective tower fan models."]},"id":"3a0a20f1-5e6f-4c15-8257-f6f8062afcde","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"9740eedc-05b0-4c3d-9043-e8ab03abb76d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/seville-classics-review\">Seville Classics UltraSlimline</a>","<a href=\"/holmes-review\">Holmes HT38RB-U</a>","<a href=\"/lasko-wind-curve-review\">Lasko Wind Curve 2551</a>","<a href=\"/honeywell-review\">Honeywell QuietSet Whole Room</a>","<a href=\"/arctic-pro-review\">Arctic Pro 2103</a>","<a href=\"/westinghouse-review\">Westinghouse WFTR40W</a>","<a href=\"/dyson-am07-review\">Dyson AM07</a>","<a href=\"/ozeri-tower-fans-review\">Ozeri OZF3</a>","<a href=\"/vornado-tower-circulator-review\">Vornado Tower 184 Circulator</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"ceb5390c-eb88-49a2-926d-326d0ed19ca9","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_206","url":"/best-tower-fans","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-28T21:45:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-28T21:45:00Z","name":"Best Tower Fans of 2019","synopsis":"The best fans can cool you down quickly by making airflow better in rooms your air conditioner or swamp cooler doesn't reach.","review":{},"strapline":"The best fans can cool you down quickly by making airflow better in rooms your air conditioner or swamp cooler doesn't reach.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-28T17:08:31Z","id":"ua7v5XC4sUePugbVHdFcsc","meta":{"title":"Best Tower Fan 2019 -
