You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","If you have a hard time making choices between two good options, than the Taylor 9306N Splash-Proof Dual Temperature is perfect because you don’t have to choose. The Taylor 9306N Splash-Proof Dual Temperature combines the convenience and versatility of an infrared thermometer with the precision and usefulness of an instant read <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">digital thermometer</a>.","Infrared cooking thermometers used to only be found in industrial kitchens and labs; however, they are moving into home kitchens. The major benefit of an infrared thermometer is the ability to test surface temperatures without touching the targeted surface. The Taylor 9306N Splash-Proof Dual Temperature works in a point-and-shot fashion. You aim the thermometer at the target and press the scan button. The infrared beam fires, and the temperature reading is taken. This allows you to know the precise temperature of items in the kitchen that previously were hard to measure. You will know the exact temperature of poaching liquids, a pan on medium-high and the surface of a heated grill.","A major drawback of a standalone infrared thermometer is its inability to test internal meat temperatures. The Taylor 9306N Splash-Proof Dual Temperature also includes a thermocouple probe, turning it into an instant read thermometer. This expands the uses of the Taylor 9306N Splash-Proof Dual Temperature. You can get fast and accurate readings on not only the cooking surface, but on the actual meat too.","The Taylor 9306N Splash-Proof Dual Temperature includes a minimum and maximum mode. You may select to either have the thermometer display either the high or low temperature taken during a reading. This is very convenient, especially with the infrared thermometer, because you can continue to scan the surface for hot or cold pockets without having to keep an eye trained on the LCD display.","The infrared thermometer temperature range is -67 to 482 degrees Fahrenheit (-55 to 250 degrees Celsius), and it has a one-second response time. The thermocouple temperature range is -67 to 626 degrees Fahrenheit (-55 to 330 degrees Celsius), also with a one-second response time. This gives you a professional range of testability. The readings can be displayed in either Fahrenheit or Celsius, so it’s easy to follow any recipe you have, regardless of how it is written out.","A battery indicator on the Taylor 9306N Splash-Proof Dual Temperature helps you to know the battery life left in the thermometer. It runs on AAA batteries. Many similar digital meat thermometers take disk batteries that are more difficult to replace.","The Taylor 9306N Splash-Proof Dual Temperature gives you both infrared and instant read technologies in an easy-to-use thermometer. With just one device, you can have the have the advantages of both technologies in your kitchen."]},"id":"8182900c-1626-4924-a9d8-04ddea96c476","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58148","url":"/taylor-dual-temperature-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-13T20:58:24Z","datePublished":"2013-11-13T20:58:24Z","name":"Taylor Dual Temperature 9306N","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-11-13T20:58:24Z","id":"jzwzdDZjVskzsorq8L78Uk","meta":{"title":"Taylor Dual Temperature 9306N Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Taylor 9306N Splash-Proof Dual Temperature is a grill thermometer that combines both an infrared and instant read thermometer.
