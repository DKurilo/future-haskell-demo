Some of the contact lens brands available include Acuvue, CooperVision, Proclear, Purevision and SofLens. You can also find color contacts if you would like to try a different eye color.","This online contacts provider offers free standard shipping on orders over $89, which is easily achievable when you buy a year&#39;s supply of lenses. After the processing period, you can expect your order in five to seven days with standard shipping. You can track your order through the website, so you know when to expect your contacts. The company offers expedited shipping if you need your contacts sooner.","In case the contacts you order do not work for you, SV Contacts allows you to return the lenses up to 30 days from the purchase date. The contacts must be unused and in their original packaging in order to be eligible for a refund. You can also exchange lenses for new ones if you wish.","SV Contacts has an FAQs page that is very helpful. You can find answers to most of your basic questions on this page, but in case you need direct support, customer representatives are available over the phone or through email. However, SV Contacts does not provide live chat support, so if you want immediate help, you have to call.","If you are looking for accessories to add to your contacts order, SV Contacts can provide them. The company sells contact solution, eye drops, sunglasses, and is one of the few online contact lens retailers to sell lens inserters and removers. With a variety of accessories added to the company&#39;s inventory, you have the convenience of a one-stop shopping experience, which can save you some time."]},"id":"a68e144f-5e41-4a3d-b627-1d08c4992304","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"448acebc-a350-4f77-8f54-cd5f9f8652ab","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["SV Contacts has a good selection of brand name lenses, from the best brands to custom-made contact lenses.
