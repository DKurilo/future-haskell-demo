You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","AudioActive <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">Bluetooth earbuds</a> from GoGroove give you several hours of listening time with efficient charging so you don&#39;t have to wait long to use them. You can control music and phone calls through the right earbud. These wireless earbuds are a bit bulkier and less flexible than others, so if you are looking for better design, we recommend looking at some of our higher-ranked products.","Sound quality is nothing to boast about with these earbuds. The bass, mid and high tones are all average. There is no special bass-boosting technology offered, but you can reach a high volume on these earbuds before the audio fills with static. The sound stays consistent up to 20 feet, even in loud environments. The range can go as far as 30 feet, but for gym or home use, 20 feet is more than adequate.","These wireless earbuds aren&#39;t made to be shakeproof but do provide sweat and other moisture resistance. The AudioActive Bluetooth earbuds are also made to be ambient noise-resistant for clear, uninterrupted audio. This largely depends on which style of rubber tips you use for the earbuds, though.","The controls are very user-friendly but stick out far enough you can accidentally hit them if you were going for another button. The buttons sit on a wheel, and if you move forward, it snaps back into place. Pushing the buttons will pause, play or turn the earbuds on. If you are adjusting the volume and aren&#39;t careful, you can accidentally push the button in and turn them off.","One thing we didn&#39;t like about these earbuds was the physical design. They felt stiff and getting them around your head gives you a feeling they may break. The sides are bulky and the actual inserts constantly need adjusting. Don&#39;t be fooled by the size though because these are much lighter than they look. At just 2 ounces they are so lightweight that it seems the tight fit was made so they didn&#39;t fall off your head.","A long-lasting battery somewhat makes up for awkward design. You can get up to seven hours of listening time and you can charge it with a USB cable or an AC adapter. Using the AC adapter fully charges the device in less than an hour and the USB cable charges it in two hours.","AudioActive earbuds have a page on the GoGroove website specifically dedicated to FAQs and a knowledgebase full of answers to common questions. There is no phone number, but you can get a relatively quick, 24-hour response by sending an email. AudioActive earbuds provide a one-year warranty, but not against sweat damage."]},"id":"47e00008-9592-4c6b-8b2a-60b0999b36be","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9472de83-a0bd-45a2-964c-c2a340b5be42","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The AudioActive earbuds from GoGroove offer average sound meshed with light yet awkward design.
