You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The PSP 3000 made further modifications to its predecessor. Its weight and dimensions are much the same, but expanded multimedia capabilities and improved video output make it ideal for future generations. Sony has seen a steady increase in demand for its handheld <a href=\"/electronics/gaming/best-video-game-consoles/\">video game consoles</a>, and as with many of its other products, it has made a place for itself in the world of portable gaming.","Along with improvements to screen contrast and a change in location for Wi-Fi and memory cards, the PSP 3000 contains several important differences from the original PSP video game console model. The PSP 3000 offers improved brightness, decreased pixel response time, increased color range and the relocation of several buttons, such as the Home key.","The PSP console was the first to make use of the Universal Media Disc that Sony developed. Universal Media Discs can hold up to 1.8GB of data, allowing it to be a device for playing both video games and other video and audio media. This ultra small disc is ideal for road trips or to slip into your backpack for lunchtime gaming.","The PSP Network provides online game play for PSP users, offering unique IDs, matchmaking according to skill level, region, language and custom settings for play between friends. PSP also offers Remote Play options, enabling users to access many PS3 features from a remote location. Compatible content includes photos and slideshows, music files and stored video files, among others. However, while most PS3 features are accessible by remote on the PSP, several media, including DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, PS2 and PS3 games are not supported.","The PSP 3000 game console utilizes 802.11b, IrDA and USB for internet connectivity. The PSP console is equipped with an embedded browser that allows for multi-tab web browsing and online game play. Content downloads are also available through both the PSP Network and other third parties.","The PSP offers full compatibility with the PS3 system, functioning as both an additional controller and a remote-access console. The PSP can retrieve audio, video and some game content remotely from the PS3 console, greatly expanding its multimedia uses. However, some video and game content, such as DVD, Blu-ray, PS2 and PS3 games cannot be played or viewed remotely.","Sony offers a variety of options for help and support, ranging from telephone, email and online chat assistance. Its official website also offers detailed information about how and where to obtain repair services, including status repair updates. Best of all, Sony offers a dedicated customer service department to respond to customer concerns, as well as downloadable user manuals and tutorials.","Sony is one of the biggest names in the world of electronics. The PlayStation is one of the biggest names in the world of video game consoles. Because of the company&#39;s years of experience, Sony is able to offer some of the best customer service and support on the web. Its support options range from telephone numbers, email, FAQs and of course live chat. Sony also offers repair services and online manuals and tutorials."]},"id":"a7eb4239-0799-4b1c-a3f9-70b058fc47ab","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b5c9d605-3f54-4cd3-8c26-e04addd4db67","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The PSP 3000 has consistently placed a strong emphasis on video and graphic output, multimedia, and advanced game play and connectivity, remaining several steps ahead of the competition in these areas.
