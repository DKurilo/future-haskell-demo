Instead of running a full scan of your system, WinUtilities offers individual cleaners, analyzers and optimizers to see how your PC stands and where it can be improved.","WinUtilities Pro offers many repair and recovery tools to help you speed up your computer. From the modules page you can access the disk cleaner, registry cleaner, shortcuts fixer and uninstall manager. All of these features can remove extraneous files and programs that are slowing down your PC. There is also a one-click maintenance tab, and from that screen you can perform basic or advanced maintenance to keep your computer clutter-free all the time.","Many diagnostic tools are missing from the WinUtilities Pro toolbox. You&#39;ll only be able to analyze system information and file and folder settings. Many of the best PC cleanup tools have other features, such as hard-drive failure monitors, partition management and driver statistics. WinUtilities Pro doesn&#39;t include these tools, making it harder to figure out what&#39;s wrong with your system.","Using WinUtilities Pro to optimize your system is simple. The modules or features you can choose from include registry defrag, disk defrag, memory optimizer, BHO remover and startup cleaner. Each of these modules has further options once you select them. Memory Optimizer, for instance, will provide information and solutions for your RAM and CPU and allow you to control your program and optimizer settings.","YL Computing provides an email address and online contact form for any questions you might have. There’s a user forum and FAQs for WinUtilities on the website, but there aren&#39;t very many entries and they present a limited amount of information. You can install WinUtilities Pro on three different computers under one license, however, so that&#39;s a definite bonus."]},"id":"7117bb1f-e421-4559-922e-62a90e887475","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"282cd77f-c2d2-4f25-9c48-feb9da1524b5","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["WinUtilities Pro is an unusual PC system utilities application because it’s more of a cluster of tools rather than one unified utility.
