The fryer does most of the work for you – including keeping time. This Masterbuilt model also uses less oil than most turkey fryers, so even if you reuse oil, you’ll spend less over time.","Because this turkey fryer is electric, it has only a 5,630 Btu capacity (1,650 watts) – much lower than outdoor propane turkey fryers. Still, that’s high for an electric indoor model. You can fry a 20-pound turkey in the MB23010618, which is plenty big. As such, it’s a great tool for cooking for a crowd. If you’re preparing a smaller turkey, try the <a href=\"/masterbuilt-butterball-review\">Masterbuilt Butterball Electric Fryer MB23010118</a>.","Unfortunately, this fryer doesn&#39;t have a vented lid, which would allow steam to escape so the appliance doesn’t overheat. It would also reduce the risk of steam burns when you open the lid.","However, this model includes several excellent safety features, chief among them an auto shut-off, a lifter and a cooking basket. The auto shut-off ensures the machine doesn’t get too hot, while the lifter helps you safely remove the turkey from the basin and oil when it finishes cooking. Similarly, the cooking basket allows you to safely lower the turkey into the basin and keeps the bird securely in place. Further, there are two fill lines: one for the minimum amount of oil (1.5 gallons) and another for the maximum (2.75 gallons). These guide you so you don’t overfill the machine, which can present a hazard. Finally, in case you need to cut power quickly, this fryer has a magnetic breakaway electrical cord.","In addition, the Masterbuilt Butterball XL Fryer MB23010618 includes a lot of features that make it convenient to use. For example, it has a built-in timer and a thermostat as well as an orange indicator light that shows when the electrical power is on and a green light to signal when the oil is hot enough to begin cooking. When you use the lifter to pull the cooked turkey up, you can simply hook it onto the interior rim of the pot so excess oil can drain off the turkey before you take the bird out completely.","The timer is digital, and you set it using the control panel. You can adjust the temperature up to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, which is high enough to use water to boil or steam food. Additionally, the temperature control ensures the machine doesn’t reach dangerously hot temperatures, which is especially important when cooking with oil.","It’s easier to clean this turkey fryer than many other models we reviewed. For example, you can remove cooled oil through a drain valve instead of having to tip the pot to pour oil into another container, which can make a greasy mess if you spill. The machine also comes with a removable spout to help guide the oil as it comes out, and there’s a place to store the spout inside the fryer so you don’t lose it. In addition, you can lift the porcelain-coated pot out of the machine to clean it.","Masterbuilt includes a one-year warranty on this electric turkey fryer, which is standard for the industry."]},"id":"336d5080-0d53-434d-b3e6-3881eb6d69cd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60079","url":"/masterbuilt-butterball-xl-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-07-29T17:00:19Z","datePublished":"2014-07-29T17:00:19Z","name":"Masterbuilt Butterball XL MB23010618","synopsis":"The Masterbuilt Butterball XL Fryer MB23010618 is a great turkey fryer that’s safe to use inside and has consistent performance.","review":{"rating":90,"verdict":"The Masterbuilt Butterball XL Fryer MB23010618 is a smart choice for cooking large turkeys indoors.","pros":["You can fry a turkey as big as 20 pounds in it."],"cons":["This turkey fryer does not have a vented lid."]},"strapline":"The Masterbuilt Butterball XL Fryer MB23010618 is a great turkey fryer that’s safe to use inside and has consistent performance.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z","id":"UUfLciJq42TTFUArTCJYvh","meta":{"title":"Masterbuilt Butterball XL (Jumbo Indoor Turkey Fryer) Review","description":"The Masterbuilt Butterball XL Fryer MB23010618 is a smart choice for cooking a large turkey indoors."},"products":[{"slug":"masterbuilt-butterball-xl-mb23010618","url":"/product/masterbuilt-butterball-xl-mb23010618","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:51:37Z","name":"Masterbuilt Butterball XL MB23010618","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:51:37Z","id":"cU2UZx9UbqCgrmxdNo4B2k","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T18:51:38Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/sePZX9UAr3Hx8fiqvZGwqD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:51:37Z","mimeType":"","name":"b0a1c3973bbd113a7af13ece5a3e78bd.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/b0a1c3973bbd113a7af13ece5a3e78bd.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:51:37Z","id":"sePZX9UAr3Hx8fiqvZGwqD","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sePZX9UAr3Hx8fiqvZGwqD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Masterbuilt Butterball XL (Jumbo Indoor Turkey Fryer) Review","description":"The Masterbuilt Butterball XL Fryer MB23010618 is a smart choice for cooking a large turkey indoors."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/sePZX9UAr3Hx8fiqvZGwqD.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:51:37Z","mimeType":"","name":"b0a1c3973bbd113a7af13ece5a3e78bd.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/b0a1c3973bbd113a7af13ece5a3e78bd.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:51:37Z","id":"sePZX9UAr3Hx8fiqvZGwqD","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sePZX9UAr3Hx8fiqvZGwqD.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Masterbuilt Butterball XL (Jumbo Indoor Turkey Fryer) Review","description":"The Masterbuilt Butterball XL Fryer MB23010618 is a smart choice for cooking a large turkey indoors."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/kitchen/best-turkey-fryers/masterbuilt-butterball-xl-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"kitchen","url":"/kitchen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:51:37Z","name":"Kitchen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:51:37Z","id":"QGCpPWRdqXqguE4XK72M4N","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"fryers","url":"/kitchen/fryers","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T18:51:37Z","name":"Fryers","dateModified":"2019-04-16T18:51:37Z","id":"siiTxQJ6GH7gGxZEDS2JJd","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
