You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Braun cruZer6 <a href=\"/best-electric-hair-clippers\">men’s hair clippers</a> have a remarkable design. These clippers can run with or without a cord, they feature a non-slip grip and the clippers include a beard trimming comb. The cruZer6 can be washed under running water and it comes with a handful of accessories. However, there are a few drawbacks to these hair clippers, which is why it did not rank higher on our lineup.","The design of these hair clippers helps it standout when compared to similar products. It features a sliding trimmer built onto the device so you easily get the precision you need. These electric hair clippers can run with or without a cord, and the cordless operation can run up to 40 minutes on a single charge. This is one of the shortest times we saw for a cordless clipper. Many of the best cordless hair clippers will last up to 100 minutes on a single charge.","These Braun hair clippers have the power to cut facial and wet hair. A beard trimming comb is included with the set that allows you to trim your beard 1 to 11 mm long. Very few hair clippers include a beard trimming comb, so this is a nice bonus. Additional accessories include a hair clipper comb that can cut hair 10 to 20 mm long. The combs click onto the clippers and easily lock into place.","However, there are several accessories that this hair cutting kit does not include. There are no left and right taper attachments or blending attachments. Additionally, there are no tools such as barber capes, scissors or hair clips. However, t","One large advantage to using these men’s clippers is that they are easy to use. They feature a non-slip grip that makes holding the clippers over your head for extended periods of time simple. Maintenance is also a simple process, as you can run these clippers under water. This hair trimmer does not require any extensive cleaning with oils and brushes.","These hair clippers are covered under a two-year manufacturer&#39;s warranty. This is an adequate warranty on hair clippers; however, some of the best hair clippers offer a warranty of three to five years. If you need to communicate with a support representative, email and telephone options are available. However, there is no live-chat support option."]},"id":"0faf57da-7e33-4d7f-acef-10ee1580c7ce","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ad8e44d5-ca4f-4fd3-a3e4-a99f133b2e9c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Braun cruZer6 has strong design features.
