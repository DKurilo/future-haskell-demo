You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","up2drive is a division of BMW Bank of North America that provides auto loans and <a href=\"/best-auto-loan-services\">auto loan</a> refinancing. You can apply and receive a voucher that you can use at dealerships of your choosing. It&#39;s a good option if you&#39;re interested in using an online service to get a car loan but want to work with a direct lender rather than a broker.","Once you&#39;ve applied, you should receive approval on the same day, often within an hour. For most applications, the only other documentation you need is a driver&#39;s license. You’ll need to print the approval off and take it to the dealer when you purchase a vehicle.","With up2drive, you can set up automatic payments, see your statements and manage your loan through an online portal. In order to apply for a loan, you need to meet up2drive&#39;s monthly minimum income threshold of $1,800. This is a standard restriction on auto loans. If you choose to sign up for automatic payments, you can become eligible for rate discounts.","You can use your loan to shop around, and you don&#39;t need to have a specific car in mind when you apply. There are no tools on the website to help you shop for cars, but you can locate participating dealerships. Some states don’t have as many participating dealerships, so you might want to investigate your options before applying.","Auto loan calculators are available to help you estimate your monthly payments or your total loan amount. The calculator doesn’t take your credit score into account, nor do the sample rates listed on up2drive’s website, so the actual interest rate and your monthly payments can vary.","<br/>up2drive has quality customer service, though it can take some navigating through phone menus to find the right person to speak to, especially if you just want to learn about the service. The customer service features are minimal; the website doesn’t have any articles or FAQs. It does have an automated assistant that can answer basic questions, though we recommend calling to learn more.","up2drive is an auto loan service that offers quick approval and online applications. It is missing some features, like the ability to shop and compare cars online. It can be a good choice for a loan through a direct lender."]},"id":"0a48bbf0-891e-4b46-b18b-c38cc350c7d7","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_48846","url":"/up2drive-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-02-25T11:53:55Z","datePublished":"2010-02-25T11:53:55Z","name":"up2drive","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":33,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2010-02-25T11:53:55Z","id":"kEjFxoYkpJNELJW3StG8bX","meta":{"title":"up2drive Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"up2drive is an auto loan service with an online portal that allows you to manage your loan.
