Its wide-spread dominance over several categories is due, in part, to the quality of the copy it produces and the included CSS decryption, coupled with its fantastically intuitive interface. These features alone make it a hard product to beat in any category we place it in. Such is the case with DVD ripper software.","Of the DVD ripper applications we reviewed, DVD Cloner 2014 has the most features and capabilities. It touts the fastest copy times and yields high quality results. The software allows you to easily copy a DVD-5 to DVD-5 and a DVD-9 to DVD-9. Additionally, it features built-in CSS decryption that allows you to rip commercial DVDs.

It will copy a DVD-5 to DVD-5 and a DVD-9 to DVD-9. It maintains excellent quality, creates the copy quickly and is simple to navigate. As we mentioned above, you can use DVD Cloner to remove the various protections placed on DVDs and Blu-rays, including CSS, Sony ARCCOS and regional protections. In addition to this must-have feature, we are also impressed that this application lets you choose from two different interfaces: one for novices and one for advanced users. This design feature is unique to DVD Cloner, and we found it very beneficial.","DVD Cloner includes three video converters with purchase. The DVD to AVI, DVD to MPEG and DVD to SVCD converters do exactly what their names indicate. If you are less concerned with physical DVD backups, you will find that MPEG, VCD or AVI rips are fast alternatives to full DVD clones. Just be sure to remember that DVD Cloner itself doesn’t rip DVDs to AVI or MPEG files. For file conversion, you have to use the aforementioned converters.","The only potential gripe we foresee with this DVD ripper software concerns its lack of support for virtual drives and mounting DVD image files. DVD Cloner 2014 reads and rips disc image files perfectly well, but if you want to manage virtual disc drives, dabble in ISO image editing or create DVD and Blu-ray image backups, you will have to purchase additional third-party software.","DVD Cloner 2014 is ultimately a seamless conglomeration of a number of compelling products. The full DVD copy suite copies and backs up DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, whereas other included subprograms handle video conversion. For converting DVDs to iPod-ready formats, be sure to check the upgraded version called DVD Cloner Platinum, which comes with iPod-Cloner. This is designed to easily and quickly prepare DVD videos for use on your iDevice. iPod-Cloner rips video straight from a DVD and converts it to MP4, XviD, H264, MP3, AAC or M4A."]},"id":"02460d7c-d4da-4494-9ca2-ea923aa05e0e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ripping Attributes"},"id":"72518438-a1b6-4b83-ae7d-0317ae4da3ac","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/bxE7TVu5hRuLoo47efTZpk.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"One of the great design aspects of DVD Cloner is that the application uses advanced technology to make the DVD ripping process extremely fast and easy.
