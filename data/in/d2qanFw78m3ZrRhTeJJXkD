You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","A conveniently sized travel tumbler, the Thermos 16 Ounce Stainless Steel Commuter Bottle is easily transportable. This high-tier <a href=\"/best-thermoses\">thermos</a> has some useful features for those who want to stay hydrated while they travel but doesn&#39;t have enough capacity for all day hydration.","With an 18/8 stainless steel construction, this double-walled thermos travel mug is robust and insulated, suitable for hot and cold beverages. According to the manufacturer, the insulated travel tumbler keeps hot liquids warm for 8 hours and cold liquids cool for 12 hours. It is BPA free, so it is a good choice for health-conscious consumers. To keep beverages at a constant temperature, this model uses vacuum insulation, having an airless space between the walls of the flask. This prevents heat or cold from leaching in or out of the walls, limiting temperature change in the interior.","The Thermos 16 Ounce Stainles Steel Commuter Bottle carries a maximum of 16 fluid ounces, so is only suitable for short journeys or instances where you only need a little rehydration. It has a contoured body so is comfortable and easy to hold, making it a good choice for running or working out. To further improve comfort and portability, this travel tumbler is lightweight and compact and, because of the minimal temperature change, remains cool to hold with hot drinks and condensation-free when containing cold liquid.","Instead of a traditional screw-on lid, this travel tumbler has a locking push-button lid for ease of use. The lid is leak-proof to help prevent spills. For easy cleaning and maintenance, the lid unscrews completely and is dishwasher-safe. Beneath the push-button lid, this thermos has a moderately-sized drinking hole and a small steam hole. It doesn&#39;t, however, come with a separate cup, so is not suitable for sharing. This travel mug does not come with a carry case, so unless you tuck it in your bag or the cup holder of your vehicle, it encumbers one of your hands.","Lightweight and compact, the Thermos 16 Ounce Stainless Steel Commuter Bottle is a good choice for the daily commute or a morning jog. It keeps drinks hot or cold for long periods. Unfortunately, for a high-end model, it doesn&#39;t offer a hands-free method of transporting, so isn&#39;t the best thermos if you need the use of both hands."]},"id":"72b9f155-49df-4832-aa71-257bc00a8fcb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63308","url":"/thermos-16-ounce-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-09T18:00:39Z","datePublished":"2015-03-09T18:00:39Z","name":"Thermos 16 Ounce Commuter Bottle","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-09T18:00:39Z","id":"d2qanFw78m3ZrRhTeJJXkD","meta":{"title":"Thermos 16 Ounce Brown Commuter Bottle Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Read our unbiased review of Thermos 16 Ounce.
