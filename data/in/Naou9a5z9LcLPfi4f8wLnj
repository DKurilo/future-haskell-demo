You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","To be fair, the Sharp AQUOS Crystal isn&#39;t supposed to be a flagship phone. At around $200 retail, it&#39;s a third of the price of top <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphones</a> from Apple and Samsung, were you to buy them off-contract. Given those savings, we&#39;re more than willing to accept some loss in performance, especially with the Crystal&#39;s killer feature: a shockingly thin bezels around a wide, edge-to-edge display.","The Crystal&#39;s problem is simple: It feels as cheap as it actually is. The best smartphones are intensely personal devices, and the AQUOS Crystal&#39;s faux-metal chassis doesn&#39;t engender a sense of possessiveness. It&#39;s too plasticky. The removable back plate on our test model wouldn&#39;t even reattach properly once we took it off, and we had several staff members try. Hopefully the problem is limited to our model, because you have to remove the plate; both the SIM card and the phone&#39;s expandable storage are underneath.","Of course, if you buy the AQUOS Crystal, you&#39;re not doing it for what&#39;s under the hood; you&#39;re buying it for the screen. The phone&#39;s 5-inch display is so close to the edge of the device that, though you couldn&#39;t accurately call it bezel-free, it feels bezel-free in your hands. There&#39;s a sense of immediacy to a screen like this, as though whatever&#39;s being shown is part of the wider world around you. We&#39;d be sold, but the display is just a 720p TFT, which is nowhere near as bright or crisp as the leading AMOLED and IPS LCD variants. We noticed muddy visuals and muted colors immediately.","Powering the screen is a slow, 1.2 GHz quad-core processor and just 1.5GB of RAM. Low numbers don&#39;t always tell the whole story – Apple&#39;s iPhones sport spectacular power with famously low-seeming specifications, after all – but in this case they&#39;re accurate. From the moment you turn it on, the Crystal feels sluggish, plodding through its power-up animations and offering noticeable pauses and freezes throughout use. We even noticed that certain benchmarks we ran returned inconsistent results, an issue we haven&#39;t seen on any other smartphone we&#39;ve reviewed."]},"id":"7d0e6d54-ca01-4410-89ab-e2103a36a3c3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6e8b6264-f12d-4400-bea1-9e9fa0e34b9a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There&#39;s no question that Sharp has delivered a technologically compelling phone in the AQUOS Crystal.
