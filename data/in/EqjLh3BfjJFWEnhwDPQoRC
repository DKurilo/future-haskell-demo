AOL allows you to receive and pay bills right from your email inbox. Bill Manager Plus does not actually make your payments for you. Instead, it seamlessly links you to your payee’s website where you make the payment yourself. You can set up multiple bank and payee accounts in order to manage all your bills from one location.","AOL Bill Manager Plus also offers great alerts that protect you and your finances. Spending alerts are customized alerts based on criteria you set. For example, you can receive an alert when a large transaction was made, you’re close to exceeding your credit limit, you’re close to exceeding your cell phone minutes and more.","You can use the Upcoming Bills Calendar to see when your payments are due. The built–in analysis and charting features help you see exactly where you spent your money.","When you log in to the “my account” area and set your marketing preferences including how you want your information shared, what marketing materials you may/may not want to receive and more. They state in their privacy policy that they do “not disclose portfolio or wallet information to unaffiliated third parties other than in the limited circumstances permitted by law (for example, in response to legal process), or when you ask us to disclose the information.”","AOL indeed offers a unique bill management system that lets you keep track of everything in the same place. However, with AOL you still have to make the payments yourself. If you are not an AOL member or need a service that can pay your bills for you, see Paytrust.
