We studied product manuals and videos, talked to product representatives, and spent time in home improvement stores learning about range hood and microwave combinations. We re-evaluate periodically to keep up with the latest design trends as well as to make sure the models we feature are still a good value for the investment. ","As you look for an over-the-range microwave, you may notice some recent innovations. &#34;We&#39;re beginning to see many over-the-range units with the ability to bake using radiant heat, allowing them to serve as small ovens,&#34; according to Ed Reitano, Pacific Kitchen &amp; Home sales manager at Best Buy, which sells Insignia-brand microwaves.","However, our research indicates that folks don&#39;t often buy the more expensive microwaves with extras like the ability to bake. The bestsellers on Home Depot, Lowe&#39;s, Best Buy and Amazon averaged $214, while the over-range microwaves with convection cooking are priced at $400 to $850. Still, if you want more room to bake than your oven allows, especially around the holidays, it could be worth the investment.","<strong>How We Researched  </strong>","We have created comparison charts over the years to track the details of the best over-the-range microwaves and get a clear picture of which ones are the best bet for your money. There is a lot to consider, since these essentially give you two appliances in one. To assess the quality of the microwave, we evaluated factors such as wattage, capacity and capabilities. We looked for microwaves that have a lot of options for different kinds of dishes. Microwaves that offer any kind of one-touch cooking were preferable, as were the ones that offer sensor cooking. Our recommendations on the range hood part of this appliance come down to how much air the vent circulates and a few other convenience features.","<strong> How Much Do Over-the-Range Microwaves Cost?</strong>","Over-the-range microwaves typically cost between $100 and $500. If you’re looking for a decent, no-frills device, expect to spend $100 to $250.","Inexpensive Units<br/>The less money you spend on a microwave, the fewer features you’ll get. At a minimum, look for a microwave that has a dishwasher-safe turntable and a nonstick interior for easy cleaning. We also recommend getting one that offers a 30-second button that lets you quickly add time to an existing countdown or start a short timer. Preset food buttons, such as for popcorn, are also convenient.","Expensive Units<br/>More expensive units usually have high-end features. These might include convection ovens for quick and balanced heating; a larger capacity; fingerprint resistance; nonstick interiors that are easy to clean; smartphone compatibility; sensor cooking, which scans your food to determine how thoroughly it&#39;s cooking and adjusts cooking times accordingly; and scan-to-cook technology, which lets you scan the barcode on frozen food packages with an app that automatically sets the correct cooking time for your food.","<strong>Choosing an Over-the-Range Microwave </strong>","Power &amp; Cooking<br/>When you turn to the microwave instead of the oven, you are likely in a hurry, so the ability to cook food quickly is important in this appliance. We looked at each unit&#39;s ability to cook a lot of food quickly by evaluating total wattage, capacity, convection capabilities and other cooking features.","Vent &amp; Hood<br/>One of the best things about these units is that they combine cooking capabilities with a vent hood to control smoke from the oven. This is not only space-saving, but practical. We looked for the models that move air the fastest and provide convenient features such as night lights and automatic venting.<br/><br/>Design<br/>Since this is an appliance that will be featured prominently in your kitchen design, you will want something that looks good and has a sensible design. Having good options for colors, shelving configurations, child locks and other features can add convenience.<br/><br/>Warranty &amp; Support<br/>We favor units that come with long and strong warranties, so your investment comes with the proper protection.","<strong>How Long Should My Over-the-Range Microwave Last?</strong>","Prolonging the life of whatever microwave you buy comes down to commonsense, said Richard Spencer, who has worked in the appliance repair business since the &#39;60s and owns the Utah-based company Mark-A-Newt Appliance Specialists. Most microwaves make it only about a decade, but if you treat yours nice and buy one with good warranty coverage, it can last longer. He recommends finding one made by a well-known brand that repair shops are willing to work on and to make sure it comes with excellent warranty coverage, as microwaves can be a bit unpredictable. He&#39;s seen microwaves that cost thousands of dollars break down in their first few weeks.","Spencer also said preparing dishes that don&#39;t have much moisture can damage a microwave. Even microwavable popcorn is too dry in most cases. He recommends using a reusable glass or silicone popcorn bowl instead with a little oil. In addition, models with few moving parts typically require fewer repairs and have longer lives. You should also resist the urge to lean on the open door while looking at food so the hinges and other components last longer."]},"id":"cc8a5f87-b301-416b-8e66-7347f2da3572","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"4cdfd472-29dd-4c3c-899d-d309463f2d81","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/kenmore-review\">Kenmore 80333</a>","<a href=\"/lg-lmv1762st-review\">LG LMV1762ST</a>","<a href=\"/ge-jvm3160rfss-review\">GE JVM3160RFSS</a>","<a href=\"/samsung-me16k3000as-review\">Samsung ME16K3000AS</a>","<a href=\"/kitchenaid-umv1160cs-review\">KitchenAid UMV1160CS</a>","<a href=\"/frigidaire-lfmv1645tf-review\">Frigidaire LFMV1645TF</a>","<a href=\"/whirlpool-wmh31017hz-review\">Whirlpool WMH31017HZ</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"ec9319f7-2e15-474e-9852-a876921bb392","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_144","url":"/best-over-the-range-microwaves","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angela-parkinson","url":"/author/angela-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Angela Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4mNVTVXMirWtTXf6QMhCjd","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-02-22T18:45:00Z","datePublished":"2019-02-22T18:45:00Z","name":"Best Over-the-Range Microwaves of 2019","synopsis":"Over the range microwaves do the traditional duties of a microwave, but also include a great ventilation system for your stovetop.","review":{},"strapline":"Over the range microwaves do the traditional duties of a microwave, but also include a great ventilation system for your stovetop.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-06T22:43:49Z","id":"KkhDVohSfjJ2BN9xM4duFg","meta":{"title":"Best Over the Range Microwaves 2019 -
