You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","The 42-inch TimeCutter SS4235 (74633) is a powerful mower designed to slash work times so that you can finish your job quickly. This <a href=\"/best-riding-lawn-mowers\">riding mower</a> features several innovations unique to Toro.","A strong 725-cc engine creates up to 22 hp to power the blade and the mower through tough terrain. The 3-gallon fuel tank keeps the riding mower running until you finish your lawn or even a field. The 42-inch blade cuts a wide path that reduces your work time but also makes it difficult to fit through smaller gates and between trees too close to fences. With its exceptional width, this riding mower excels best in wide-open spaces.","The mower uses Toro&#39;s exclusive SmartSpeed technology to switch between operational modes. With Mow &amp; Go mode, your riding mower has a top speed of 7 mph to quickly mow straight areas or travel to the far end of the area you&#39;re cutting. In Trim &amp; Tow mode, the speed is reduced, but you have enhanced control for towing attachments and steering around obstacles.","This zero-turn mower can maneuver the trickiest yard. It turns around the smallest bushes and shrubs by means of two soft-grip tank-style control levers. It gives exceptional performance on flat land, but you must take care not to make sharp turns on steeper hills.","The heavy-duty 10-gauge steel deck construction makes this one of the most impact-resistant mowers on the market. A rear-engine protector keeps the motor safe against damage from backing into trees or rocks. Add in the nonslip deck and this ride-on mower is one of the safest models available.","If you drive the mower on a consistent basis, you&#39;ll appreciate the multitude of comfort features. A soft seat with a high back gives excellent support. An optional sunshade keeps you cool on hot days, and the cup holder keeps your cool drink at hand for fast hydrating. The hydrostatic transmission shifts automatically so that your focus stays on watching and steering the mower.","Toro offers a protective warranty that exceeds most other manufacturers&#39;. The three-year limited warranty protects your riding mower regardless of how many hours you run it.","The TimeCutter SS4235 is a solid investment. Zero-turn mower maneuverability combined with the dual-mode performance makes it a smart choice, whether you&#39;re a landscape pro or a serious DIY homeowner."]},"id":"bedca0e2-ac9f-4d5b-9eb5-41ca1002179f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60847","url":"/timecutter-ss4235-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
