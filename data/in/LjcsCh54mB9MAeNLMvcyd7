This multi-functional unit acts as not only as an oscillating fan, but also a swamp cooler, a humidifier, and an air purifier."]},"id":"7f526de3-e786-465d-b5b7-2049414fbf00","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Features"},"id":"64002cfc-dbb3-493b-8842-e470d2e1fe58","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Speaking of its multi-functional capabilities, many of the NewAirAF-310’s competition can also brag about their abilities to pose as more than a single appliance – but none of these models are quite as diverse as this tower fan. In terms of its air flow capabilities, this model has multiple air speeds including a low, medium, and high setting, allowing you to control the power of its breeze depending on your desires. Along with a set of multiple speeds, you can also control the air direction of the NewAir AF310 in several different ways. If you’re shooting for a direct breeze, you can use adjust the model to the fixed air delivery setting. This setting, coupled with this tower fan’s adjustable louvers, gives you complete control over the direction you want the NewAir AF-310 to be blowing if you want its breeze to be directed at an exact location. On the other hand, this oscillating fan’s 60 degree oscillation feature also allows it to cover large areas of space if you prefer to cool down, humidify, or purify an entire room. Thirdly, the NewAir AF-310 also includes several breeze modes, such as the convenient sleep mode, which automatically switches the tower fan to a low air speed setting and turns it off after a certain amount of time.","In terms of its functions as an air purifier, this tower fan includes a built-in air ionizer which can quickly improve the quality of the air around it. This built in air-ionizing unit acts to eliminate potentially dangerous airborne particles such as dust, debris, pollen, pet allergens, and more. If you or anyone you live with suffers from seasonal or year-round allergies, the NewAir AF-310 may be a great option for you to have around to help with decongestion. This oscillating fan also boasts of a germ-free water pump system, which, coupled with the ionizing unit, guarantees that the air coming from the NewAir AF-310 is fresh and clean.","Lastly, if you live in an extremely dry climate, the NewAir AF-310 can also be a great tower fan to have around because it acts as a humidifier as well. This oscillating fan is actually designed with what is called an energy-efficient evaporative technology system. The system first works by drawing in air surrounding the NewAir AF-310. It then moistens the air by means of water-saturated pads before cooling it down by evaporating the water into the pads. As a result of these steps, the NewAir AF-310 spits back out a product that is more fresh, cool, and moist than before. This technique not only moistens and cools down air, but it’s also a natural, energy-efficient, and eco-friendly process as well. Similarly, this is also the same process that swamp coolers go through – hence the fact that this tower fan also acts as a quasi swamp cooler.","The only knocks against the features found with the NewAir AF-310 are its inability to stay extremely quiet while running on its medium and high air speed settings and its lack of a humidifier turn-off feature, according to consumers of the model. The latter problem may indeed pose as an annoyance if you already live in an extremely humid area. Then again, if you already live in a humid area and are use to those conditions, the extra humidity inside your home should come as a comforting respite more so than an annoyance.  Also of minor note, no programmable thermostat feature is available with this tower fan. A few other models do include a thermostat so that you can adjust the temperature of the air and breeze coming from the fan."]},"id":"feb6fb4a-8433-4567-8ad6-ac9f6a42b05b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"e2f04361-97b1-46c6-b41e-ea0a5fb7a0e3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This oscillating fan was designed by NewAir to save space and to look fashionable while still maintaining its optimal air distribution. Its space saving, or what many like to call “streamlined” design, includes dimensions that measure 12 inches long, 11.5 inches wide, and 35 inches in height.  The NewAir AF-310 does not come with a built-in handle but only weighs about 10.6 pounds which negates the need of having some sort of handle. Also, some tower fan models come with an adjustable height feature, but you won’t find any such luck with the AF-310. Still, its slender look and solid base shouldn’t detract anyone – no matter how chic and décor-conscious you may be – from turning it down."]},"id":"de42b0b5-0524-4dd1-bd27-2c6745618c64","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"06831b48-d22e-450d-a044-15d24e95f69c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["In conclusion, there are not many tower fan, let alone oscillating fans out there that can measure up to the<strong> NewAir AF-310</strong>. Its ability to serve as a humidifier, swamp cooler, air purifier, and fan inside your home or office is second to none. Yes, it’s not perfect and does come with a few kinks in the armor such as its noise issue, the lack of a humidifier turn-off switch, and its 30-day warranty. But the pros of this tower fan far outweigh its cons, so much so that it still garners the top spot in our rankings. So be sure to have this model at the top of the list if you plan on investing in a tower fan in the near future."]},"id":"06b8156f-07ca-43c2-ad8e-3e3f1d9dad28","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53332","url":"/newair-af-310-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"noel-case","url":"/author/noel-case","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Noel Case","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"dnkqY9NHDMuLpWuEq2JyYX","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-07-21T21:19:40Z","datePublished":"2011-07-21T21:19:40Z","name":"NewAir AF-310 AF-310","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":100,"verdict":"This is the number one tower fan available due to its 4-in-1 feature and its convenience.
