You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The quality and appearance of a website is very important to whether or not an online shopper is going to buy anything. Just Lenses<strong> </strong>is one of those sites that will give an impression of mediocrity. This lack of design and complicated layout are two of the reasons they didn’t make it to the top of our lineup of <a href=\"/home/beauty/best-contact-lens/\">contact lens</a> retailers.","While we found their choice of site design to be lacking, their product selection isn’t. They carry a large assortment of types from top manufacturers. They carry daily, weekly and monthly disposable, gas permeable, novelty, silicone, toric and vial from top brands like Acuvue, Biomedics, Focus, Frequency, FreshLook, Softlens and more. Many of their lenses were priced well and close to what some of our top sites were priced. You can also find quite a collection of reading glasses that include bifocal, no line bifocal, sun readers, half frames, full frames and tube readers.","As we mentioned earlier, the design of the site is quite jumbled and not as easy to use as some of the other sites we reviewed. The font size is small, which can make it more difficult for users to find what they are looking for. At first glance, their site doesn’t have a very professional feel or look. This can make consumers think twice about the company’s validity, reputation and professionalism.","The side menu is designed similar to a lot of other sites we reviewed in that consumers can search by lens type, manufacturer and most popular. The top menu lists a couple top brands and the option to search by a couple different types. Consumers can also search for the name of the contact lenses in a dropdown menu located near the top of the page. For those that would rather search the entire site, there is a search button available.","Some of the sites we reviewed had a help and contact button that directed consumers to an FAQ page. This site does have both buttons, but they direct the consumer to two different pages. The help button takes consumers to an FAQ page that is organized into sections listing a variety of commonly asked questions. These sections are detailed and broken out to efficiently help the consumer quickly and easily find what they need to help them.","The contact button takes you to a page that lists all the available options and ways to contact the company. They list the customer service toll free phone number, international phone number, fax number and an email address. The prescription verification department has listed a toll free phone and fax number along with an email address. The company&#39;s mailing address is also made available for those needing send them anything. Unlike other sites, the customer service department is not open 24/7, but they do make a point to clearly list their hours of operation.","Just Lenses does a fantastic job of immediately making it known to their consumers that they are VeriSign and McAfee secure. This will definitely reassure you that your purchase will be safe and the information you supply will be kept private."]},"id":"7805fac5-82bf-4805-b919-fbb422d69d40","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d92b279e-c658-468a-b81f-085e37591b8c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although Just Lenses is short of user-friendly features and lacks design, you can be sure to find value, selection and security prominent throughout."]},"id":"cc6c1980-1e07-4681-896b-638986568591","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_48821","url":"/just-lenses-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-02-20T20:33:58Z","datePublished":"2010-02-20T20:33:58Z","name":"Just Lenses","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":74,"verdict":"The manufacturer rebates and large selection counteract the cluttered site and high shipping prices in most cases.","pros":["Manufacturer rebates for extra savings and a wide selection make this site worth looking into."],"cons":["Site is hard to navigate and shipping rates are slightly higher than other sites.
