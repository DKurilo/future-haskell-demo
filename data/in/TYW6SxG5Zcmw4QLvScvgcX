You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","Bissell is a well-known name with a wide array of popular cleaning products. The company offers many upright vacuum cleaners but the Bissell PowerClean stands out among them with its excellent filtration and powerful suction. Unlike many upright <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">vacuum cleaners</a> that pick up dirt then blow it back into the air, this machine filters it first. Bissell shows its confidence in this product it with an impressive five-year limited warranty.","The Bissell PowerClean uses a cyclonic air cleaning system that gives the machine continuous suction. As a bonus, you get strong airflow that collects dirt and pet hair then deposits it neatly into the container. The powerful airflow also prevents dust from accumulating and clogging your filter. The PowerClean is equipped with a patented AireTight HEPA filtration system. That means that any air that escapes the machine passes through a filter first to remove any excess dust and particulates.","The machine uses a clear plastic container, so you have a visual clue as to when to empty the dustbin. When you empty it, you may be exposed to dirt, hair and dust. However, one benefits of the machine are that you do not have to purchase expensive replacement vacuum cleaner bags.","Equipped with seven different height settings, this machine will clean anything from throw rugs to high-pile carpeting and bare floors. The vacuum cleaner transitions well from room to room. The brush roll turns off, so you can use this model on surfaces like hardwood floors.","Although this machine has extra filtration, this vacuum cleaner does not have automatic shut off features. That means if you run over a sock the motor will not shut down automatically so you can remove the object. Additionally there is no thermal shut off, so if there is a blockage or full dirt container, overheating may occur.","At 22 pounds, this cleaner is heavy and does not have many design features that enhance maneuverability. The handle does not recline back far enough to reach under low furniture. You will have to move end tables to clean under them.","When you purchase the Bissell PowerClean vacuum cleaner, you can expect it to come with a full set of multi-use tools, including a crevice tool, a combination dusting brush, an upholstery tool and an air-powered TurboBrush tool. The accessories attach to the back of the machine, so you can find them when you need them.","It is easy to contact Bissell customer service by telephone, and the website has a customer service email as well as a FAQs page. How-to videos on the web site instruct you on how change belts and filters and how to replace the brush. With service centers located most major cities, Bissell makes it easy to find local help. You just enter you zip code on the web site and it will direct you to the nearest service center."]},"id":"37229a10-4fe7-4caf-9433-4262b68b25e7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4e15949e-8fdf-4e85-86b7-2f0065b51c85","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Bissell PowerClean has a good filtration system and powerful suction.
