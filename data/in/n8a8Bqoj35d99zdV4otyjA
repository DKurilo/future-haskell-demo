You simply download the free app on your phone or login online and you can start tracking immediately because it comes with six months of service preloaded. In our tests, there was a delay of about 30 seconds or less from where the location pin was on the map and where the tracker actually was, when being driven around. This makes it ideal for tracking a car, your child, your purse or anything of value to you. You can also set boundaries to receive alerts when the device crosses them. <br />\n <br />\nThe tracker also goes to “sleep” if it’s not moving, drastically improving battery life. It kept working for more than two days before we had to cease testing and the website says it will keep running for as many as five, so there’s no need to worry about recharging all the time. It’s splash proof and comes with a small carabiner so you could attach this tracker to a bag or piece of clothing easily. One of the only downsides is its square shape is a little too big for the average pants pocket.

You must pay for a monthly subscription to track, but it’s relatively affordable compared to a lot of other subscription packages we looked at. Once you’re signed up, you can personalize the account with a photo and description of who or what you’re tracking, which is a nice touch. We took this tracker on the road and discovered it was extremely accurate, with only about 30 seconds of lag time between where the tracker is and the ping on the map. It’s discovery range is about 125 feet and while that’s not the most accurate of the trackers we tested, it’s still relatively good. You’re most likely going to be able to find the bag, person, pet or car you’re looking for in that range.  <br />\n <br />\nIn our tests, the Trax Play’s battery lasted 21 hours, which is midrange and reasonable. It would definitely last for an entire 8-hour work day and even more if you used it, for instance, to track a fleet of vehicles. It’s splash-proof but not waterproof, so don’t use it to track any submarines. It does lack two-way communication, but it has a cool augmented reality feature. When opened, it will show you your surroundings through your smart phone’s camera with the overlay of a pin showing you which way the tracker is. This is useful for finding the tag if it’s hidden once you’re close to it.

You can call the device to listen in on your kid’s surroundings or Angel Call, which essentially turns the unit into a phone allowing you to speak to the people around your child and for them to speak with you. If you notice Little Johnny has been on his bus route for too long you can simply call him through the device to see what’s happening. This is ideal for parents of children with sensory problems who might not otherwise answer a cell phone. If this seems like an overreach for your style of parenting, it’s still a very accurate tracker. In our tests, the location pin was only delayed by less than 30 seconds and its discovery radius was about 100 feet. The AngelSense battery was also one of the longest-lasting we tested, working for about 23 hours.  <br />\n  <br />\nThis tracker requires a subscription, but the app to use it on your smartphone is free. It’s also splash proof, so it will survive a little abuse as long as it doesn’t accidentally end up in a swimming pool. If your child is very young or prone to losing things, AngelSense comes with a belt and pouch you can affix to clothing or a backpack with a pin system that only comes undone with a magnetic key. There’s a learning curve to using them but they’re really quite effective; there’s no way the GPS could fall out of a pocket or bag.

Bluetooth trackers like the Tile Mate work by sending a signal between the tracker and your phone or computer, so the range is going to be much shorter. Some GPS trackers can even use different Wi-Fi signals within a large building to triangulate what room someone is in. That being said, these little gadgets are handy but they’re not magic. If you live somewhere with poor cellphone reception, your GPS tracker reception will also most likely be poor.

They can help you keep track of your products, property and staff, all from the comfort of your phone or computer screen. There are a variety of trackers available to suit your business needs. We suggest picking a company that allows you to use as many trackers as possible at once. For example, the BrickHouse tracker we tested shows you where several trackers are at one time. Many companies, including BrickHouse Security, also make trackers specifically for vehicles. These trackers let you know where your employees are, and you&#39;ll get an alert if the devices are uninstalled. The trackers tell you not only the vehicles&#39; locations but also the speed at which the cars are traveling. However, our research indicates that these trackers are a little more difficult to install than regular GPS trackers. Trackers can also be useful for keeping an eye on valuable company assets or for making sure your employees have reached their destinations. ","Tracking Your Child<br/>Using a GPS tracker with your child can put your mind at ease, but there are several things you should keep in mind. GPS trackers with two-way communication mean you can listen to your what your child is doing whenever they’re wearing the device, but we strongly encourage you not to abuse this feature and constantly check the app. Instead, we recommend setting up predetermined safe zones so you’ll receive alerts when your child leaves that area. That way you’re not checking the app every 5 seconds and the device’s battery will last longer. You can also work with your child’s teachers and school officials to come up with a plan for when it’s appropriate for the GPS device to be on at school. Just remember a GPS tracker is no substitute for good parenting. We encourage you to talk to your children about safety, avoiding strangers and when to dial 9-1-1."]},"id":"a1b10314-50bd-4d70-9f03-87be48d9fe18","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"1530c3bc-81ca-4071-9a76-5ae9d6e795d2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/veriot-venture-review\">Veriot Venture</a>","<a href=\"/amber-alert-gps-review\">Amber Alert GPS</a>","<a href=\"/angelsense-review\">AngelSense</a>","<a href=\"/trax-review\">Trax Play</a>","<a href=\"/spark-nano-review\">Brickhouse Spark Nano 6.0</a>","<a href=\"/pocketfinder-review\">Yepzon Pocketfinder+</a>","<a href=\"/tile-mate-review\">Tile Mate</a>","<a href=\"/hereo-review\">hereO V2</a>","<a href=\"/spot-gen3-review\">SPOT Gen3</a>","<a href=\"/spot-trace-review\">SPOT Trace</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"7e058f45-b0d5-48ac-8a42-72035d8de7b2","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_152","url":"/best-gps-trackers","authors":[{"email":"anna.burleson@futurenet.com","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-14T21:50:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-14T21:50:00Z","name":"Best GPS Trackers of 2019","synopsis":"We tested a variety of GPS tracking devices in real-world scenarios.
