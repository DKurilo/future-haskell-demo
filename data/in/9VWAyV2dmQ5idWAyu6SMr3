But, when you walk into your local gadgets and gizmos store you are completely taken aback because there are walls and walls of televisions to choose from and you don’t know the difference between LCD, CRT, DLP, Y2K, ASAP, Adam or Eve (Ok Y2K, ASAP, Adam and Eve are not TVs, but you get the idea.)","Televisions, like people, come in all shapes and sizes; and some shapes and sizes are better suited for specific things. But when a gamer goes looking for a TV that will give them the most complete Halo experience, they’ve got to know a little about what they are looking for.","Ideally, you want a television that will give you the best picture, best resolution, best response and the best bang for your buck. There are two options that will allow you to get the most out of your gaming experience, LCD and DLP.","In the past, gamers have been overlooked. Manufactures never saw reason to appeal video game geeks and children, they weren’t the ones spending the money; they weren’t the target market. However, as generation Y (you know the kids that grew up playing Super Mario Brothers) gets older and have a growing expendable income, TV manufactures began to take notice as gamers began investing in $500 video consoles.","For the best experience go with a widescreen, 1080p HDTV, LCD TV with HDMI connections and a good contrast ratio. Ok, so what does all that mean? HD technology enables you to view your games in the highest definition and clarity the game is capable of. I suggest an LCD because unlike Plasma there is less chance of burn-in from static images like life force, clock or weapons choice. And whether it’s day or night, you will always have a great picture. However, avoid going <em>too</em> big on your screen size, most games are not designed with 60-inch screens in mind and over doing it may destroy the integrity of the graphics.","If LCD is out of your price range, and to most it is, the second best option is a DLP with 1080p or 720p HD. DLP is a slightly older technology that uses a rear projection model; therefore, it is bulkier than an LCD. DLP technology is somewhere between old CRT tube television that have been around for 50 years, and modern ultra thin digital technologies that are bound to take over the world. Some of DLPs cons include the slight inability to see the screen unless you are sitting directly in front of it and they are a little sensitive to light, so the darker the room the better.<br/>","What is great about both an LCD TV and DLP TV is not only are they ideal for serious gamers, but they are both versatile, all around good television choices for homes with many television demands."]},"id":"66260993-1957-467a-8170-12d3bbee00b4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_3183","url":"/the-best-tv-for-gamers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"erin-monaghan","url":"/author/erin-monaghan","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Erin Monaghan","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"pJhSzFvAjtB92wXxfULoVW","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-04-04T13:11:00Z","datePublished":"2008-04-04T13:11:00Z","name":"The Best TV for Gamers","synopsis":"So you’ve decided it’s time to upgrade the old boob tube to something that is fancier, thinner and will get the most out of your HD Xbox 360 and other new toys.","review":{},"strapline":"So you’ve decided it’s time to upgrade the old boob tube to something that is fancier, thinner and will get the most out of your HD Xbox 360 and other new toys.","language":"en","dateModified":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","id":"9VWAyV2dmQ5idWAyu6SMr3","meta":{"title":"The Best TV for Gamers","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
