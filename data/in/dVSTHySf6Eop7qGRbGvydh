The other large burner also reaches 15,000 Btu, and the smaller burners range between 5,000 Btu and 9,500 Btu. The stove’s grates come off in two pieces, and the shiny black cooktop is easy to wipe down. Also, the cooktop is gently recessed to catch any spills, and the burners are all sealed to prevent debris from falling below the surface.","This range has a 5.8-cubic-foot convection oven, which is larger than average compared to the other models we reviewed. Maytag’s EvenAir True Convection feature uses a sturdy fan to circulate air to create consistent roasting and baking results. The oven reaches a modest maximum temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit, which might not be high enough for cooks who want crisp pizza crusts or who use other quick-baking doughs. Similarly, the MGR6600FB’s broiler is among the least powerful – it outputs up to 10,000 Btu, while several other gas ranges have broilers rated at 13,500 Btu.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"322ab95b-c2e9-41d1-b9ae-8d538176b827","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The MGR6600FB has a heat self-cleaning cycle, timed-bake shutoff function, Sabbath mode, warm setting and control lock.

In addition, the cooktop burners, oven burners, cast-iron metal grates and cavity all have 10-year warranties.
