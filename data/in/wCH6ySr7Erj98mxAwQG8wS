Smart features allow you to access all of your favorite media directly through the TV or cast your own photos and videos using a phone or tablet. The LG UF7600 is perhaps the best smart TV we reviewed, but for all its user-friendliness, the set’s picture quality suffers.","The UF7600 has 4K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. Despite having standard specs and dimensions for an LED TV in its price range, the picture quality on this TV is low, thanks to the edge-lit backlighting behind the screen. Instead of incorporating a full array of LED backlights into the display, there are only LEDs along the edges of the TV frame. Some TVs pull this off, but this LG has subpar light distribution, resulting in poor black uniformity and washed-out colors.","The only advantage to edge-lit backlighting is a wide viewing angle. While low quality, the picture stays faithful up to a 40-degree angle. Even though the picture on this TV isn’t the best, it does come in three sizes – 43, 49 and 55 inches – and the bigger the screen, the wider the viewing angle. This poor contrast from the backlighting on this TV reflects lots of outside light and glare. In addition, the semi-gloss screen reflects especially bright light sources and creates rainbow glare on the screen.","There are plenty of input channels for gaming consoles, laptops and analogue players to connect to the TV. On the back panel, there are three HDMI inputs and three USB inputs, as well as one composite, one component and one RF connection. Internet is required for any of the LG’s smart capabilities. If you don’t have Wi-Fi in your home, you can plug an Ethernet cable directly into the TV with other inputs.","When you bring up webOS, you’ll find the main menu is a simple pop-up task bar. It’s colorful and clearly labeled with the apps, connections and channels you use most. The webOS 2.0 interface is simple, and you can customize the toolbar with your favorite channels and apps. There are many apps available in the webOS store, and the most popular services like Netflix come preinstalled and require no purchase. You can buy new apps for the TV the same way you do on your smartphone.","LG’s webOS allows you to run multiple apps at once. You can split the screen to organize the different items you want to show. This way, you can watch live cable next to live Twitter feeds of the event. You can control the platform many different ways, including the mobile app for your phone or tablet, voice control and a remote with airmouse technology, which controls your TV like a Nintendo Wii-mote.","Like similar LED TVs, this LG model is under warranty for one year. If you have questions, check out the website for live chat, email forms or the FAQs page. For a live customer representative, LG has phone lines open until 6 p.m. CST."]},"id":"e18a9232-9b76-49e5-8744-496af3eb5c2b","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3e6a3d60-427f-4613-b683-9061163b9c73","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the picture quality on the LG UF7600 is low, this LED TV earned top points for its smart features.
