You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Protection 1 is a nationwide company that offers <a href=\"/best-home-security-monitoring\">home security monitoring</a>, equipment and installation services. It has several options for monitoring, including wireless monitoring through a cellular line or a broadband internet connection. With its comprehensive alarm systems and monitoring services, Protection 1 is one of the best home security monitoring service providers.","When it comes to home security monitoring, you want a company that can provide a plan that fits your needs. Protection 1 can be quite flexible, which is one of its best traits. The company even still offers a landline connection option if you live in a rural area or someplace with poor cellular reception. Protection 1&#39;s main home security monitoring station is in Kansas and equipped with a backup system to intervene if needed. For long-term problems, the company has an off-site monitoring station that can handle your needs until its main home security monitoring site is back up and running.","Protection 1 offers four alarm packages, and its most basic provides a number of useful features. You get a keypad control panel, three door or window sensors, a motion detector, a yard sign, three window stickers, alerts for extreme changes in temperature or flooding, monitoring for fire and carbon monoxide, and a keychain remote. The more advanced three packages give you such things as a two-way intercom connection with the company and video surveillance, depending on how much you want to invest. You can choose to add individual devices to your system as well.","If you are the DIY type, you are out of luck with Protection 1, because you cannot install equipment yourself. Some <a href=\"/best-home-security-systems\">home security companies</a> send equipment to you, and you simply plug it in or stick sensors to areas such as doors. Protection 1 requires that professional technicians put in your equipment. However, this service is free, and unlike other home security monitoring firms, Protection 1 notes that it conducts <a href=\"/best-background-check-services\">background checks</a> on its employees.","When it comes to customer support, Protection 1 does quite well. It gives you the option to contact a representative by phone or email, or you can even chat live with someone on the company&#39;s website. In this regard, Protection 1 is very accommodating, and its representatives are courteous. Its team is knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions you have. In addition, there are many FAQs and tutorials to teach you how to use your system. To obtain any information that is not covered in those FAQs, you have to contact Protection 1 directly. The warranty option for this home security monitoring company covers your equipment for three years, whereas many companies offer a lifetime warranty."]},"id":"5d67c456-ce34-4e7e-902d-8e0e49261b74","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c835a71f-e7ec-461f-b369-6225232a0981","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Protection 1 offers all the essential home security monitoring options, such as cellular connection and interactive access.
