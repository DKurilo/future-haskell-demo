We advise shopping the features instead of letting price alone guide you.","Performance<br/>The best juicers extract as much liquid as possible from fruits and vegetables, leaving behind very little pulp. Machines that leave large amounts of very moist pulp just aren’t doing their job. The same is true for froth. Every juicer makes some froth, but you don&#39;t want inches of bubbles – you want a machine that gives you the most juice for your money.","Design<br/>If you&#39;re serious about juicing, it&#39;s best to get a juicer that fits nicely on your kitchen counter so you can leave it out rather than having to haul it out of a cupboard. That means paying close attention to the dimensions and even the length of the electrical cord. You don&#39;t want to buy a juicer that looks great in your kitchen but doesn&#39;t have a cord that reaches the outlet.","Noise is another consideration. All the machines we tested make a certain amount of racket, but you might want to choose a less-noisy model if you don’t want to wake the other members of your household every morning.","Extras<br/>If accessories are important to you, make sure the machine includes a pitcher, a froth separator, a pulp strainer and a cleaning brush.

Blenders reduce foods to a fibrous liquid that includes the skins and pulp of fruits and vegetables while juicers eliminate as much of the skin and pulp as possible and thus remove fiber. You often need to add a bit more liquid, like water or milk, when blending as the food gets pretty dense when blended. To be healthy it’s best not to add sugars. Juicers can be pretty expensive, so we know it’s tempting to try juicing foods with your blender. However, in our own testing, when we tried to strain the juice from blenders we were hardly able to get any juice from the attempt, even after pressing and squeezing the smoothie against a fine colander. All we really ended up with was a huge mess. If you really want to try juicing, we recommend you save yourself the hassle and invest in a juicer. <br/><strong><br/>Is Blending or Juicing Better for You?</strong><br/>","Before answering this question, let’s talk about what makes dietary fiber so important. It’s found in a variety of foods, including broccoli, whole wheat and apples. As explained previously, juicers discard pulp, which is where fiber comes from. Oddly enough, fiber is important to your body because you can&#39;t digest it.","Accord to the <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983\">Mayo Clinic</a>, there are two types of fiber: soluble fiber and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber dissolves in water – it turns into a gel-like material when digested, which helps lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels. On the other hand, insoluble fiber helps your digestive system by increasing stool size and getting things moving, which is why it is often suggested as an aid for constipation.","However, that’s not all fiber does. In the same article, the Mayo Clinic explains that a high fiber diet can help you lower cholesterol, control blood sugar and achieve a healthy weight. It can even help you live longer. As such, you don&#39;t want to cut fiber from your diet unless otherwise instructed to by a doctor.","Still, just because fiber is good for you and juicing gets rid of it, that doesn’t necessarily make juicing bad. According to <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/juicing-health-risks-and-benefits#1\">WebMD</a>, juicing is a great way to help people who don’t like fruits and vegetables get enough in their diet. When you juice, you just need to make sure you consume enough fiber through other foods. One way to do so it to add juiced fruits and vegetables to fiber-filled foods like homemade soups, muffin batter and pasta dishes. It’s a nifty way to add more nutrients to your meals and keep you healthy.","Basically, as long as you don&#39;t add a lot of sugar, blending is often better for you since it doesn&#39;t remove fiber. To make juicing healthy, you have to take extra steps to ensure you get enough dietary fiber. If juicing sounds like too much work, check out our list of the best <a href=\"/best-blenders\">blenders</a>.","Keep in mind that some people may be on a doctor-recommended, low-fiber diet, in which case juicing might be a healthier option.
