The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-top-load-washing-machines\"><em>top-load washing machines</em></a><em> here.</em>","The LG Mega Capacity Front Control WT1701CV top-load washer ranks just below our top-rated units, but it is a good option and includes plenty of wash cycles and extra options for adjusting the settings to each individual load.","Standard top-load washers place the control panel back behind the tub, forcing you to reach across the device to start a load. LG has moved those controls to the front of the unit for easier access. This is a nice design element that many manufacturers are using nowadays.","We like the large washtub capacity you get on this washing machine because it allows you to put more laundry into a single load. We’re also happy to see 12 wash cycles and 13 additional wash options included on this unit. This washer does lack some wash cycles we like to see included, such as color-saving and allergen-removal wash cycles, but most other cycles are present. Among the 12 cycles are cotton/normal, bulky/bedding, speed wash, heavy duty, whites and delicates. Some of the 12 additional wash options are cold wash, fabric softener, delay wash, custom program and stain care. These options and others give you plenty of flexibility.","This LG washer isn’t the most energy efficient on our top-load washing machine comparison, but it is close. According to its EnergyGuide, this top-loader will consume an estimated 155 kilowatt-hours each year, costing you $17 annually.","LG provides excellent warranty coverage with this washing machine, one of the best in the industry. For the first year you have the washer, the parts and labor are backed by warranty. Additionally, the motor is covered for the first 10 years and the washtub has lifetime coverage.","We’re disappointed to find that LG doesn’t have the user manual for this washing machine available on its website, and that there are no frequently asked questions to reference, but you can contact LG by phone and email for any help you need with the unit. You can also use the live chat function on its website to get help."]},"id":"e17bf498-cf0f-472e-ac75-25cbe91e55d6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"39338892-2048-4513-bae4-e5969f4a9fa3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You get a large-capacity washtub and a plethora of wash cycles and options with the LG Mega Capacity Front Control WT1701CV top-load washing machine.
