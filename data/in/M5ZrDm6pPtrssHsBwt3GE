You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Pacific Image ImageBox MF is a <a href=\"/best-slide-to-digital-image-converters\">slide to digital image converter</a> that changes photos, films and slides into a digital format. The 9MP image sensor converts your media into JPEG images, although at a lower resolution than the best slide to digital converters. While traditional flatbed scanners record color using a slow-moving bar, this unit captures images instantly, and the 2.7-inch color LCD screen displays them in real time.","This slide converter comes with built-in dust and scratch editing capabilities. This feature, which the manufacturer calls Magic Touch, is unique to Pacific Image; most converters like the <a href=\"/veho-review\">Veho Smartfix Slide &amp; Negative to SD Card</a> require you to use photo editing software to clean up images after they’ve been converted to a JPEG format. This feature is great if you have damaged slides and don’t want to invest in and spend time learning how to use complex software.","The Pacific Image ImageBox MF comes with a TV-out jack and cable, which allows you to view your converted images on a television. A USB cable is included, so you can transfer and view the images on a PC. This slide to digital converter is compatible with all Windows and Mac operating systems.","This unit lacks integrated memory, so you do need to purchase a memory card separately in order to convert your slides into a digital format. Included with your purchase, however, is a user manual, USB 2.0 cable, TV-out cable, A/C adapter, 35 mm film holder frame, slide holder frame and 120 mm film template. The device has a sleek design like the <a href=\"/ion-review\">ION Pics 2 SD</a> and high-quality construction. It is the largest converter on our lineup, however, weighing just under 5 pounds and measuring 9.9 x 9.2 x 7.2 inches.","Pacific Image converters come with a one-year warranty. The support page on the company’s website provides troubleshooting tips, and a dropdown menu directs you to an online manual for help. The FAQs page works the same way. There is also contact information for direct technical support. From our testing, we were impressed with the technical support representatives’ knowledge and quick responses to our inquiries."]},"id":"d09dbd18-81b9-4ce8-bc6d-4a806aba7bdb","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0c308f1f-b436-4a0f-92fa-c4a33e5ddf94","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Even though the resolution output is low and the unit doesn’t have any internal memory, the Pacific Image product developers are ahead of the competition when it comes to the ImageBox’s included editing features.
