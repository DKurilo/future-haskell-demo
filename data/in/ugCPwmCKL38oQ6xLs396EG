The original review is below, but check out our current</em><i> </i><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/money/tax/best-online-tax-software/\"><em>Online Tax Software Reviews</em></a><i> </i><em>here.</em>","<em>Editor&#39;s Note: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reports that the latest tax forms for the 2015 tax season will be released January 19, 2016. Online tax software services will not have access to those forms until the release date. While you may be able to prepare your return in advance, you cannot e-file until the forms are released and the IRS is accepting returns. While we have performed our preliminary tests, we cannot fully test the services and rank the products until all services are available for testing. We will update our reviews through the tax season as the newest versions are released.</em>","Using Oneprice Taxes, it is  only $19.95 to e-file most types of 1040s. All returns, whether they are 1040EZs, simple 1040s or 1040s with itemized deductions, are only $19.95 to e-file. Or you can bundle and e-file your federal and state return using this online tax service for only $34.95. We noticed that the software was easier to use in the past few years compared to previous year&#39;s versions, so it is apparent that Oneprice Taxes does spend effort to keep the software up to date. We found it effortless to enter W-2 data and personal information. It can create simple returns easily – it&#39;s primarily a fill-in-the-blank interface with links to further explanations should you need them. If you have used Jackson Hewitt&#39;s online tax service before, you might recognize the Oneprice format as the two use the same basic software.","This tax preparation service provides a few time-saving features such as importing data from returns stored by Oneprice Taxes or TurboTax. This service can also import data from Shoeboxed, Outright and Etsy. It can help you decide whether standard or itemized deductions are more beneficial for you, and it includes a refund/owe meter so you can watch your progress as you create your return. However, it does not include things like a mobile app or the ability to import your W-2s.","Oneprice Taxes provides free chat support, and you can contact the company by email. However, no telephone support or fax number is posted. In most cases, Oneprice promises to answer your questions in one business day, which is a significant improvement from the past years. The website&#39;s FAQs and online tax help sections are limited, however, and its irregularly updated blog is scant on articles about complex tax topics. If you notice something familiar, it is because Oneprice Taxes uses similar software as Jackson Hewitt. This is quite common with tax software; however, customer service is handled by the individual company."]},"id":"b8545e06-a1b6-44ff-bb96-7afd8b0128a4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"48acd1ec-9089-4c7c-bf92-b14bbf48402d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This online tax software is affordable and can handle simple filing.
