You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Epson WorkForce 310 <a href=\"/best-all-in-one-printers\">all-in-one printer</a> provides a good value for those who are in need of a multi-functioning machine with a conservative budget.","For those who are looking for the best copying features in an all-in-one printer the Epson WorkForce 310 offers just that. This machine allows you to copy up to 99 copies without ever having to turn on your computer. Need to enlarge or reduce the print size? No problem. This all-in-one printer also offers you the ability to reduce copies down to 25 percent of their original size or up to a whopping 400 percent of the original. Do you have a color image that needs to be printed in black and white? No problem. Just select the black and white option when making your copies and the color disappears. The copy quality feature also allows you to choose &#34;draft copies&#34; for those documents that do not need to be in crisp reading condition, &#34;standard&#34; for regular-quality viewing and &#34;best&#34; for high-quality copying. By changing your copy quality you will ultimately spend less money on ink, reducing your overall printing cost. The DURABrite Ultra Ink technology allows you the ability to handle prints and copies from the moment they come out because the ink dries almost instantaneously. The ink is also smudge-proof and waterproof. You can even use a highlighter on this ink and it will not blur or fade. This feature is excellent for students and others who like to color code their work.","If it&#39;s scanning that you are interested in, the Epson WorkForce 310 comes with a color flatbed scanner with an optical resolution of 1,200dpi. The scanner uses 48-bit color, creating excellent-looking papers as well as photos.","Are you tired of setting print jobs, walking away to complete another unfinished task and coming back to find that the print job hasn&#39;t completed because the printer ran out of paper? The Epson WorkForce 310 offers an input tray that will hold up to 100 sheets of plain paper. This will definitely help you save time and frustration by not having to constantly refill the empty paper tray.","The fax side of the Epson WorkForce 310 is up to industry standards, but it is nothing to get too excited about. This all-in-one printer allows you the ability to store up to 60 different frequently used fax numbers. While this will add efficiency and speed to your already busy work day, there are other printers out there that will hold twice as many fax numbers. However, the Epson WorkForce 310 does have a decent size memory bank. It will hold up to 180 pages at a time.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"acd0f6f5-161d-427f-a505-b68033bf09d6","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_48310","url":"/epson-workforce-310-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jessica-richards","url":"/author/jessica-richards","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jessica Richards","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"nAoS5iTvT5f6rLahJWrxtf","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-12-23T17:37:34Z","datePublished":"2009-12-23T17:37:34Z","name":"Epson WorkForce 310 310","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","review":{"rating":52,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-12-23T17:37:34Z","id":"7ydRWFTZJHHp2KQMMLPSwn","meta":{"title":"Epson WorkForce 310 310 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
