In fact, it actually offers a lot of value for how much you spend. This scope does have a few disadvantages, but it is a great <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43718-best-microscopes-for-kids.html\">starter microscope</a> for a young child.","This microscope is above average for looking at transparent slides. With a score of 83 percent, it did better than most of the microscopes we tested, which averaged 69.7 percent. The display is a bit narrow, but slides were generally easy for us to view. They came out clear and bright under various magnifications.","As good as this student microscope was for viewing slides in our tests, it struggled with solid objects. Because it doesn&#39;t have a light from the top, we had difficulty viewing anything solid. The objects came out primarily black, as there was insufficient lighting. The only exception was a thin blade of grass, which we could partially see. This inability to view solid objects is apparent in its magnification level for 3D objects, which received a score of 7 percent out of 100.","Aside from this disadvantage, the M30 is a well-designed scope. We had no problems operating the instrument. It&#39;s simple and straightforward to use. The only levers are used to raise and lower the platform, and you turn on the light by flipping the mirror attachment on the bottom. A young child will have no issue using it. In addition to its ease of use, this scope comes with multicolored lenses. You can view the slides using the different colors, offering another interesting adjustment for a child.","This microscope stands out the most in its included accessories. Most children&#39;s microscopes only include a few items. This one has practically everything. You get numerous items with your purchase, including tweezers, blank slides and even a shrimp hatchery. As this is the least expensive of all the microscopes we tested, its number of accessories is impressive.","The M30 comes with a long warranty and helpful customer support. While most scopes only have a one-year warranty, this one gives you five years to return it to be fixed or replaced if broken. This is useful for a young child&#39;s microscope. If you have any questions, you can easily contact the manufacturer through phone or mail."]},"id":"64ceae90-bd29-4359-bb8e-9b9c67a27d81","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"108a39cb-3f00-481c-ba04-8a80138b3220","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["As the least expensive microscope for kids we&#39;ve tested, the AMSCOPE-KIDS M30 does surprisingly well.
