Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","This unique carabineer camera has been designed to go almost everywhere – everywhere but underwater that is. It is an outdoor model built to withstand the rough tumbles that may occur in the great outdoors in addition to the drops and possible kicks that may come from a young user. The Argus Bean Sprout<strong> </strong>is far from being the best <a href=\"/electronics/photo-video/best-digital-cameras-for-children/\">digital camera for children</a>, but it does put up a good fight. It has more features than all the other digital cameras for kids we reviewed, but it lacks the ease and simplicity.","The carabineer shape of this digital camera for kids makes it easy to attach to a backpack or belt loop so it is easy to carry and hard to lose. In addition to the unique and convenient shape, the kid’s digital camera is also one of the only digital cameras for children to offer a timer. The timer is a feature that we found only older kids will greatly appreciate. Although it cannot be submerged in water, it is splash resistant and will survive the rain or the mist of waterfall.","The picture quality of this digital camera for kids is very poor compared to all of the products we ranked above it, offering only 0.3 megapixels. There is also no zoom and no flash – making the digital camera for children an almost completely outdoor product. There is a camcorder mode which will work as a web cam when hooked up to your PC. However, this feature may or may not come in handy for the child in your life.","There are 2MB of internal storage offered by the Bean Sprout digital cameras for children and no slot for an external memory card, which limits the pictures and videos your child can take. It can be recharged by hooking it up to your PC through the provided USB cable, and it runs on a Li-Ion rechargeable battery. It is one of the only digital cameras for children to come with a rechargeable battery. If you run out of battery and do not have a computer close by, there is no way to change the battery and it is rendered useless until charged.","There is no screen for viewing pictures after they have been taken; there is, however, a small .25” LCD screen that displays the mode the camera is currently on. All modes are shown in two letters or numbers, and users are meant to then decode what mode they are on. That is fine for an adult, but we didn’t feel that was such a great idea for digital cameras for children.","Because of its unique shape, it is especially hard for young children to hold it and get pictures perfectly straight. There is a small viewfinder near the top of the camera that will allow your children to find the area they would like to take a picture of. Like most digital cameras for children, the shutter button to take the picture is on the top, right-hand side of the camera and is convenient to use unless your child is left handed.","The LCD display and the mode button are also on the back of it beneath the viewfinder. As mentioned above, the LCD display shows what mode the camera is on, and the mode button, when pressed, will change the mode. Overall, we found it slightly more involved than other digital cameras for children and not as simple to use as we would have hoped for a young child. It is a good, durable camera, great for the outdoors, but definitely a better choice for older kids.","Argus has created a user manual to accompany the Bean Sprout digital camera for kids, and we found it very useful. It was only through this user manual that we were able to learn what the two-digit codes for each mode represented. We felt like the manual was still slightly short, and we would have appreciated it if it were a bit longer. We were never able to connect to a customer support representative through the phone number or email that they provided."]},"id":"0ed00a0a-0d4c-42ad-87d4-17aef8f6d4ee","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"0f65248f-7c5d-4161-939b-21cffe13e4b2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Overall we felt like the Argus Bean Sprout digital camera for children had a lot of features to offer – the water resistance, unique shape, timer, and camcorder capabilities, it has more than many other digital camera for kids.
