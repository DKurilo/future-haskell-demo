The products and pricing they offer is the same as WildBlue, though. Since these satellite internet companies are so similar, we looked at what their websites have to offer to determine which one is easier to use. While MyBlueDish has a simple web design and great information, it doesn’t have a search capability. MyBlueDish also doesn’t have its pricing page broken down as much as the other company’s webpage. "]},"id":"f7ef607f-575a-4b09-9a47-8f4ad6f45a89","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Speed &amp; Performance"},"id":"447b232c-8479-4d3d-b40f-740ec90968cd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["MyBlueDish provides high-speed internet in rural areas. If you’re tired of dealing with the slow loading time associated with dial-up and you want to free up your phone lines, MyBlueDish might be the satellite internet provider for you. MyBlueDish claims their loading time is 30 times faster than dial-up. They don’t guarantee the speeds they list on their website. The speeds they list are the maximum speeds your plan will run at. Most times, you’ll have a slower speed than the one MyBlueDish has listed on your plan. This is especially the case during high traffic times, but their customer service says that’s only about 15 percent of the time.","You can choose from three plans through MyBlueDish: Value, Select and Pro. With the Value plan, you’ll receive top download and upload speeds of 512 kilobits per second (Kbps) and 128Kbps, respectively. The Select plan speeds reach 1 megabit per second (Mbps) for downloading and 200Kbps for uploading. The Pro plan has a maximum download speed of 1.5Mbps and an upload speed of 256Kbps.","MyBlueDish has a couple more steps you must take before you can see local pricing for your area than other satellite internet providers. MyBlueDish also doesn’t break down the pricing information as much as other providers. Although you don’t see whether your plan includes anti-virus or anti-spyware software, leasing information, installation and setup costs, and shipping and handling, you still see the basic information about what you’re purchasing. If you have any questions, MyBlueDish’s friendly customer service representatives can answer your questions.","The type of satellite internet that MyBlueDish sells has high latency, which is the case with most consumer-based satellite internet companies. High latency makes this type of product, whether from MyBlueDish or its competitors, not very good for internet activities such as real-time internet games, VoIP (internet telephone calls) and virtual private networks (VPNs). However, if you’re planning to do mostly web surfing, you won’t notice any slowdowns.","To make sure they have enough bandwidth to provide the internet for their customers, satellite internet companies create bandwidth caps that restrict how much internet usage each client can have. Once you meet that cap, your satellite internet speed drops until you meet the company’s qualifications. Some satellite internet providers slow down your internet speed for a number of hours if you download a large file. MyBlueDish calculates your download allowance in a different way. MyBlueDish uses a rolling 30-day Fair Access Policy (FAP). This means that they add up the amount of data you’ve uploaded and downloaded in the past 30 days. Every day, they calculate your FAP from the previous 30 days.","Your download allowances will vary depending on the plan you select through MyBlueDish. The Value plan offers you a download amount of 7,500 megabytes (MB) and an upload amount of 2,300MB for every 30 days. If you choose the Select plan, you’ll have 12,000MB of download allowance and 3,000MB of upload allowance in 30 day&#39;s time. The Pro plan will allow you to download 17,000MB and upload 5,000MB."]},"id":"c8bcaf9b-5590-430c-a7a0-743d070674f8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Bandwidth Threshold"},"id":"edc21eba-e3a7-47c3-95d2-cfe9646facac","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["MyBlueDish has 24/7 telephone support.
