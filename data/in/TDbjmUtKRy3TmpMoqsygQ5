We relied on product specifications and EER ratings to evaluate effectiveness in terms of power and energy efficiency.","We tested the mobility of each portable air conditioner by moving them between rooms. For the most part, we only had trouble moving each product into our test lab while in the shipping packaging. After unpacking the units, it took much less effort to move each one using the built-in wheels. However, if you need to carry any of these units up or down stairs, we suggest caution and having someone assist you. Even though these air conditioning units were designed to be portable, on average they weighed 63.","To test how loud the machines were, we used a sound meter to measure noise levels while they were operating. Using this method, we found that the <a href=\"/amico-review\">Amico AP11000</a> is the quietest unit we tested, at around 48 dB. The loudest portable AC unit we tested is the NewAir AC-14100E, measuring around 57 dB. Although this might look like a small variation, it&#39;s not. The typical human ear perceives a doubling in loudness every 10 decibels, so 57 dB is nearly twice as loud as 48 dB. A quieter air conditioner may be best in bedrooms if noise keeps you awake at night or in areas where people talk. ","<strong>How much do portable air conditioners cost?</strong>","On average, portable air conditioners cost around $400, though you can find units as low as $250 and as high as $700. As with other types of air conditioners, you can expect to pay extra for units that have greater power and efficiency than average. You can also expect ongoing costs of around $94 a year on your electricity bill.","<strong>What to look for in a portable AC unit</strong>","When looking to buy a portable air conditioning unit, there are some key considerations you need to make, as well as some jargon you need to get to grips with. Here&#39;s what you need to look for before you buy a portable AC unit.","<strong>What is BTU on Air Condition?<br/> </strong><br/>","BTU standard for British Thermal Unit is basically a means to measure heat. Air conditioners use BTU to measure how much heat an air conditioning unit can add or remove from a room in the space of an hour. The higher the BTU rating, the quicker the unit will remove the warm air. ","<strong>Are air conditioners with a high BTU rating always better? </strong>","You should always calculate the BTU you need for the space, and buy a portable air conditioner that is capable of cooling that air. An air conditioner with a high BTU rating will cool a small space quickly, and cycle off. This could cause the temperature to climb again, and you’ll need to restart the machine. ","This is not only frustrating, but by turning the machine on and off in a small amount of time it can cause extra wear and tear on the air conditioner’s compressor, shortening the lifespan of your portable air conditioner. So, a higher BTU is not always the sensible option.<br/>","But you should always err on the side of having the BTU rating being slightly higher, as choosing an air conditioner with a lower BTU for the space might mean you will never reach your the most comfortable temperature. ","<strong>How to calculate the BTU needed for room size</strong>","BTU rating is used to calculate the maximum room size for an air conditioner. First up, you need to measure the room you plan to use the AC unit in. Once you&#39;ve done that, you can use this handy chart from <a href=\"https://www.energystar.gov/products/heating_cooling/air_conditioning_room?qt-consumers_product_tab=2#qt-consumers_product_tab\">Energy Star</a> to determine the BTU you need. ","This is just an average, and there are other factors that will affect the calculation. If you are on a higher floor, the heat typical raises too or the room is in direct sunlight it best to adjust the air conditioners BTU rating by 10%. ","In rooms that are naturally shaded, and not exposed to sunlight you can reduce the BTU rating by 10%. However, it is best to err on the side of caution and have a higher BTU than not enough. ","In rooms where there are heat sources, like an oven in a kitchen, it is advised you add 4000 BTU onto the rating of the portable air conditioner to counter your appliances. ","Apart from room size, you can also look over the unit&#39;s other power specifications such as power level, air flow, moisture removal and fan modes, all of which determine the effectiveness of a portable air conditioner. However, comparing room size against the BTU is the best indicator. In general, higher values mean higher performance, though the most powerful machines often have lower energy efficiency.","<strong>Portable air conditioner’s efficiency ratings</strong>","For efficiency, we looked at each unit&#39;s Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) as provided by the manufacturer. This tells you how much energy it uses when compared with its output power. Among the units we reviewed, the highest EER rating we found is 11.1 while the average rating is 9.84. You can expect to save money on your electric bill if you choose a machine with higher EER ratings. In general, portable AC units aren&#39;t as efficient as other types of air conditioners, but they are great for cooling specific areas in your home or apartment.","We also calculated the estimated cost to run a unit eight hours a day for a year using the national average cost of electricity. While this is a practical way to see long-term costs, it differs from the EER because weaker units sometimes cost less to run than more efficient units that are also more powerful.","<strong>Portable air conditioner warranty</strong>","There are two types of warranties on portable air conditioners: one for the compressor and another for parts. Because the compressor is the most essential component, it should have as long a warranty as possible. The average compressor warranty is three years, but the best units – such as those from Frigidaire, Haier and Honeywell https://www.toptenreviews.com/home/hvac/best-portable-air-conditioners/honeywell-review/– have five years of warranty coverage. You can expect a minimum compressor warranty of one year. With parts warranties, also called appliance warranties, you can expect one year of coverage from the manufacturers in our comparison.","We also advise you to check how the warranty works. Some companies, like Whynter, require you to send the product to California to be fixed or replaced. As portable air conditioning units are heavy, this is an expensive cost, and postage fees can be as much as a new machine. ","<strong>Convenience features on an AC unit</strong>","Convenience features can affect your experience with the portable air conditioner, for better or worse, depending on how you plan to use the machine. The units we tested all have a 24-hour programmable timer, wheels on the bottom and a remote control. However, a few have unique features that differentiate them. These include a sleep mode that adjusts the temperature as you sleep, as well as an auto-restart that turns the machine back on after power outages.","<strong>Hose length of an air conditioner</strong>","Hose length is an important consideration before buying a portable air conditioner. All portable air conditioners need to vented outside through a window. If you have furniture in front of the window, a longer hose is needed to be able to vent heated air outside. Look at the space you have available and where you want to place your portable AC unit. Measure this distance to make sure the hose is long enough. We would recommend portable AC units with a hose length of 5 feet or more for the maximum flexibility. ","<strong>Single or dual hose portable air conditioners </strong>","There are no hoseless portable air conditioners. A single hose portable AC has one hose. The compressor uses this hose to pump the hot air it has extracted from your room outside. A single hose design is considered effective than a dual hosed portable AC unit because it creates negative pressure. <br/>","Negative pressure means that is easier for the warmer air from outside to find its way back inside your room, meaning the air conditioner has to worker harder to keep your room cool. This lower the efficiency of the AC unit compared to dual hose systems. ","Single hose portable air conditioning units are cheaper to buy, and cost less to run. This is a great choice for people who value budget over efficiency as it saves you money in two ways. ","Dual hose portable air conditioners have two hoses. One hose is designed to pump hot air from the room, while the other pumps in cold air. This system is designed to stop the buildup of negative pressure, making it more efficient. This means they are excellent at lowering the temperatures, and are usually the better performing portable air conditioners. But this performance comes at a higher initial cost, and electric bill. ","<br/><strong>Setting up a portable air conditioner </strong>","A lot of people have difficulty installing a <a href=\"https://coolandportable.com/how-to-install-portable-air-conditioner-no-leaks/\">portable air conditioning unit</a>, especially if they have vertical windows. <br/>","Before purchasing a portable AC read a few reviews to see how easy it was to adjust the window kit to the style of window you will be venting through. You may have to trim window kits that are bigger than your window’s opening or add plywood frame for those openings that are bigger. ","<strong><br/></strong>","<strong>Portable air conditioners noise level</strong>","Portable AC units are noisy. They use motorized fans and compressors that create a flow of air. If you are looking for a quieter unit for the bedroom, or something that you can hear the television over, we recommend you check the decibel levels before buying. ","<strong><br/></strong>","<strong>Do portable air conditioners have to be vented out a window?</strong>","Air conditioners work by pulling humidity and heat from the air and venting it somewhere else. In a typical <a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">window air conditioner</a> or <a href=\"/best-central-air-conditioning-units\">c</a><a href=\"/best-central-air-conditioning-units\">entral AC unit</a>, the hot air is released into the outside air near the unit.","Portable air conditioners work a little differently. If it released equal amounts of hot air as cool air into the room, there would be no cooling effect, making them expensive noise machines. They use an insulated exhaust hose to move heat waste through a nearby window. ","If a portable air conditioner worked the same way, it would release as much hot air, if not more, as it would cold air into a room, essentially negating any cooling in the room. Because of this, portable air conditioners use an insulated exhaust hose to transfer waste heat to a nearby window.<br/>","No exhaust hose is perfect, so some of the heat leaks into the surrounding room before it leaves the window. This is why portable air conditioners are considered the least efficient type of air conditioner on the market. When it comes to home air conditioners, portability always comes at the cost of energy efficiency.","There are alternatives to portable air conditioners, in case you don’t have a window for ventilation, such as tower fans and <a href=\"/best-portable-evaporative-coolers\">portable evaporative coolers</a>, though these don’t cool rooms much compared to a proper air conditioner.","<strong>Do you have to drain a portable air conditioner?</strong>","While most portable air conditioners have an automatic evaporation system, most still need a little help getting rid of all the water. Automatic evaporation systems move the condense water to area where it evaporates and gets blown out with the exhaust hose. However, in our experience, this system doesn’t always operate as well as it should, and does require emptying. ","No. While it’s true that moisture collects in a portable air conditioner, modern units have an automatic evaporation system. This moves water collected from the air inside your home to the other side of the AC unit where it evaporates and gets blown out through the exhaust hose, along with excess heat.","<strong>Do portable air conditioners have filters?</strong> ","Most portable air conditioning units have filters.These filters are designed to remove dust and particles from the air and prevents them from damaging the machine.   ","Regularly cleaning these filters will prolong the life of your portable AC unit. If dirt is allowed to gather, it forms a crust on the coil, which will stop it from pumping the heat outside. This can cause the compressor to overheat, and stop working. ","Don’t use soap to clean the filters, as this can leave the filter sticky, and cause a rapid build up of dust. When cleaning the filters, it is also recommended that you clean the vents on the machine too, as the fans can suck in dust.<br/> <br/>","<strong>How long do portable air conditioners last?</strong>","Depending on how well you maintain your portable air conditioner, you can generally get between 5 and 10 years of service. Pay close attention to the warranty on the compressor, as this is a good indicator of how long the unit will last. You can expect portable AC units to last longer than the warranty if you keep up with basic maintenance tasks, such as cleaning filters and winterizing the unit when you put it away for the season. For guidance on how to conduct maintenance, refer to the owner’s manual that comes with your air conditioner.","It should be noted there are a large number of complaints about durability of portable air conditioners across all brands, and models. There are a large number of factors that can result in a lower than expected life span. When buying a portable air conditioner we always recommend you choose one with the best warranty. ","<strong>Read more:</strong>","<a href=\"/best-air-conditioners-review\">Best air conditioners</a><br/><a href=\"/best-central-air-conditioning-units\">Best central air conditioning units</a><br/><a href=\"/best-wall-air-conditioners\">Best wall air conditioners</a><br/><a href=\"/best-window-air-conditioners\">Best window air conditioners</a><br/><a href=\"/best-gas-furnaces\">Best gas furnaces</a> "]},"id":"f0a6a0b0-0832-444f-b0e3-63b963802370","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_279","url":"/best-portable-air-conditioners","authors":[{"email":"jcarlsen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-04-15T20:10:00Z","datePublished":"2019-04-15T20:10:00Z","name":"Best portable air conditioners 2019: keep cool wherever you are","synopsis":"Here are the best portable AC units, ranked by their cooling performance, energy costs, certifications, convenience and warranty.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best portable AC units, ranked by their cooling performance, energy costs, certifications, convenience and warranty.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-04-17T15:53:35Z","id":"TDbjmUtKRy3TmpMoqsygQ5","meta":{"title":"Best Portable Air Conditioners 2019 -
