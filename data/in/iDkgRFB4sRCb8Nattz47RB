Along with weather measurements, this personal weather station uses a feature that allows you to see variations in weather data over a 25-day period enabling comparisons and extrapolation for future forecasts.","This unit has a wireless transmission distance of 1,000 feet, outdistancing many other weather stations. A refresh occurs every 2.5 seconds. The heat index and wind chill are calculated every 10 seconds, and the frequency-hopping feature allows continuous, uninterrupted reporting. The sensor has a durable cover protecting it from the elements, and the weather station uses solar power to augment the battery life.","This wireless weather station creates graphs for the previous 25 hours and allows you to pinpoint past weather conditions easily. Twenty-two alarms are available for certain weather conditions, including a freeze warning or flood warning with rain rate.","You can set the time and date on this personal weather system, and it displays sunrise and sunset for the day. Moon phases are also displayed, which can be handy for campers.","Measurements for indoor temperature and humidity are updated every minute. This device measures the outdoor temperature from minus 40 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit every 10 seconds and updates outdoor humidity, measured from zero to 100 percent, every 50 seconds. The thermometer in the wireless weather station has a radiation shield, allowing for more placement options. A bubble level incorporated in the sensor enhances accuracy by allowing you to precisely install the sensor, and it assists with data collection.","The sensor collects rain using a tipping spoon mechanism that is self-emptying. The measurement is set at a specification of 0.01 inch. The anemometer provided with this home weather station measures wind speeds from 2 mph up to 180 mph, with updates every 2.5 seconds. The wind direction is measurable in degrees or compass points.","The Davis Instruments Vantage Vue 6250 wireless weather station has a backlit display with a keyboard that glows in the dark. The unit displays weather forecast icons and weather trends, making it simple to see what tomorrowâ€™s weather will bring.","This is a rugged, accurate personal weather station with many extras. Its long distance wireless transmission and user-friendly features, such as a glow-in-the-dark keyboard, make it easy to use. A radiation shield and extensive data measurements make this a comprehensive weather station."]},"id":"9a93392c-4268-4a72-843b-0f942f1c4247","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63337","url":"/davis-instruments-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-09T19:45:34Z","datePublished":"2015-03-09T19:45:34Z","name":"Davis Instruments Vantage Vue 6250","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.
