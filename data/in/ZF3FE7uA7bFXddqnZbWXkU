This company has a low minimum requirement of $5,000, though this may vary depending on your location. <a href=\"/new-era-review\">New Era</a> and <a href=\"/oak-view-review\">Oak View</a> are two other companies with low minimums.","When you begin service with Premier Debt Help, simply fill out the online form found on the company website with your contact information and the type of debt you owe. A debt specialist will contact you to go over your financial situation and plan for the future.","Fees for negotiation are 20 percent of your enrolled debt, which is lower than average. This means more savings from consolidating your debt go to you rather than fees. This service only charges you fees after it has successfully lowered your debt; according to FTC rules, no company can charge you ahead of time for these services.","The bill consolidation program with this consolidation company takes about 12 to 42 months. Twelve months is on the low end of the industry average and may not be applicable to most people&#39;s situations. Keep in mind that your program&#39;s length of time may vary based on your situation and that you should be wary of anyone who tells you that they can quickly fix your financial troubles. When you enter the program, you are responsible for putting money away into an account; these funds will go toward paying your creditors.","Throughout the program, you are responsible for your debts, and your creditors are within their rights to call you or even sue, though this is rare. While Premier Debt Help can help you manage your collection call, it cannot and should not promise to stop them.","Debt consolidation is a risky process, so choosing a reputable company is imperative. Premier Debt Help is IAPDA accredited. IAPDA is an industry leader for training and certifying debt arbitrators. These trainings ensure that representatives use best practices and follow FTC rules in their interactions with you and that they will have the best techniques for achieving the highest benefits for you.","Throughout your program, you are assigned a personal representative. This person will be your point of contact throughout the duration of your debt consolidation program. However, if you need further assistance, you can access your account through the online and mobile platforms. Furthermore, the company website has self-help tools, such as a debt calculator, which helps you figure out your monthly payments and how long it will take you to pay off your debts."]},"id":"ad7ae5c7-9608-4b77-a9c4-1ac0c1ca0023","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"7380301f-8ee1-4bb0-b118-3274f52658b1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With Premier Debt Help, you don&#39;t pay any upfront fees, including management fees or account fees, which some companies use as a loophole to collect advance fees.
