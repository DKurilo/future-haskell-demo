The Bamboo’s cover is made from a soft material that tends to breathe easier and keep you cooler at night while you sleep. It also doesn’t absorb oils as easily as other pillows and covers. The cover of this pillow is machine washable.","There are some drawbacks to this pillow that we discovered during testing. At night the filling moves and tends to bunch above your head creating a higher loft (or the height of your pillow) in that area. Our sleepers would turn the pillow around to take advantage of this higher loft. At first it provided good comfort and support to their neck, but as they slept, the poly-filling again moved out from under their head and built up this loft above them.","Another important point to note is the cost of the Bamboo by Snuggle-Pedic. This is the most expensive pillow we tested, too, by $20 for a standard size and $90 for a king size. Our testers didn’t feel the cost of this pillow was worth it, especially since you can get comparable support and comfort from cheaper pillows.","The Bamboo pillow does come with a 20-year warranty. Also, Snuggle-Pedic gives you 120 nights to test out this pillow before deciding if you want to keep it. This is important because experts believe it takes about two weeks for you to get used to a new pillow and a minimum of 30 days for a pillow to be properly worn in. "]},"id":"42a72182-d727-49c9-a948-d7af7201da9d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"ce618743-28c1-4137-9798-b6ed4bf5bff0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Bamboo by Snuggle-Pedic is comfortable and offers good support, we found the shifting of the poly-filling during the night was inconvenient.
