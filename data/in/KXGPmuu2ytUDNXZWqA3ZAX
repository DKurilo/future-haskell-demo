Its premiums are affordable – lower than VSP’s but slightly more expensive than United Healthcare’s. One drawback is Humana charges a $35 enrollment fee upon signing up.","Humana offers one vision plan: the Vision Plus plan. This has a monthly premium of $13.99, along with a $1 monthly administration fee. A plan with a spouse or dependent costs around $26.99, plus the monthly administration fee. These premiums are on the high end, but they are offset by substantial benefits that can save you money in the long term.","An annual eye exam only costs you a $10 copay. Since eye exams can cost between $100 and $200 without insurance, the copay is already well on the way to covering the price of your premium. If you need an exam for fitting contact lenses, your copay is $40. You also get a $100 allowance for frames, with a 20-percent discount after that allowance. This benefit can be used once every 24 months. If you’d rather get contact lenses, Humana covers $115 with a 15-percent discount on any costs beyond that limit. Replacement lenses have a $25 copay. You’re eligible for the lens and contact benefits once every 12 months.","Humana has a network of around 12,000 providers, and you can use the company’s website to find one nearby. In case your preferred vision provider isn’t part of the network, Humana offers out-of-network benefits. You get a $30 allowance for eye exams, a $50 allowance on frames, a $25 allowance on standard lenses and a $92 allowance on contact lenses. There’s no discount if you exceed the allowance, so if possible, try to find an in-network provider.","You can also bundle vision insurance with dental insurance. If you do, you only pay the enrollment fee once. Humana vision insurance can also be used at participating retailers such as Target and Costco. Check the website to ensure your local store participates in Humana."]},"id":"f4ea6fe6-f117-4874-b494-3c1dad96ec66","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62708","url":"/humana-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-11T20:40:33Z","datePublished":"2015-02-11T20:40:33Z","name":"Humana","synopsis":"Humana is a solid choice for vision insurance, especially if you want to cover you family.","review":{"rating":73,"verdict":"Humana has low exam copays and good prices for family plans, though it does have a smaller network than other insurers.","pros":["It has good plans for families."],"cons":["You have to pay an enrollment fee upon joining."]},"strapline":"Humana is a solid choice for vision insurance, especially if you want to cover you family.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","id":"KXGPmuu2ytUDNXZWqA3ZAX","meta":{"title":"Humana Vision Care Review - Pros and Cons","description":"Humana has low exam co-pays and good prices for family plans, though it does have a smaller network than other insurers."},"products":[{"slug":"humana","url":"/product/humana","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T16:11:41Z","name":"Humana","dateModified":"2019-04-05T16:11:41Z","id":"5dokA4VBenoyuUeTQ6dTgP","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-05T16:11:41Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ggoUfuHszBVHuWgPQAabzZ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T16:11:41Z","mimeType":"","name":"8476b173ce7e6f3f30e1c7bac07c5a48.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/8476b173ce7e6f3f30e1c7bac07c5a48.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T16:11:41Z","id":"ggoUfuHszBVHuWgPQAabzZ","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ggoUfuHszBVHuWgPQAabzZ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Humana Vision Care Review - Pros and Cons","description":"Humana has low exam co-pays and good prices for family plans, though it does have a smaller network than other insurers."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/ggoUfuHszBVHuWgPQAabzZ.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T16:11:41Z","mimeType":"","name":"8476b173ce7e6f3f30e1c7bac07c5a48.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/8476b173ce7e6f3f30e1c7bac07c5a48.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-05T16:11:41Z","id":"ggoUfuHszBVHuWgPQAabzZ","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ggoUfuHszBVHuWgPQAabzZ.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Humana Vision Care Review - Pros and Cons","description":"Humana has low exam co-pays and good prices for family plans, though it does have a smaller network than other insurers."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/services/insurance/best-vision-care/humana-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"health-and-beauty","url":"/health-and-beauty","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T16:11:41Z","name":"Health & Beauty","dateModified":"2019-04-05T16:11:41Z","id":"5johNE4w3ctxAug7oACGPh","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"health-care","url":"/health-and-beauty/health-care","dateCreated":"2019-04-05T16:11:41Z","name":"Health Care","dateModified":"2019-04-05T16:11:41Z","id":"tumUHyURMTDpUocFTwo3ZA","dateImported":"2019-04-05T12:55:59Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
