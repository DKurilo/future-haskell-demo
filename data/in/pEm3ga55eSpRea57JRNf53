This is a well-built cable that you can expect to last for a long time. For all of its good looks and capability, though, this is a cable that&#39;s largely over-engineered – and you&#39;ll see that in its price. This is one of the most expensive HDMI cables on the market, and it doesn&#39;t quite justify its price. Still, the 1000HD&#39;s high build quality makes it a good choice for long-distance cable runs, though the <a href=\"/audioquest-high-speed-with-ethernet-hdmi-cable-review\">AudioQuest Pearl</a> HDMI cables are a more affordable option.","The HDMI cable is manufactured with high-quality materials that offer ample conductivity, durability and protection from corrosion. However, the website notes that the cable&#39;s 17.8 Gbps bandwidth trails off over longer distances, and it does not specify the cable&#39;s gauge (or diameter). However, the cable&#39;s large bandwidth and quality materials enable the company to offer it in lengths up to 50 feet, unlike some of its competitors.","The Monster maintains the High-Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet certification issued by HDMI Licensing, LLC, which requires that all its lengths support a minimum of 10.2 Gbps. Its Ethernet component provides an internet connection. This eliminates the need for an additional cable and is more reliable than wireless internet, but it only works with devices that support the technology. At the time of writing, few devices support HDMI with Ethernet. However, most of the cables we looked at include Ethernet, so we are confident that it is only a matter of time before HDMI with Ethernet becomes the standard.","Inside the cables, the company uses high-purity copper conductors. High-purity means that the copper has extremely low levels of oxygen and other gases, which could corrode the metal over time and reduce its connectivity. The cable is triple-shielded with high-density materials, which prevent noise and other interference.","It also uses a nitrogen gas-injected dielectric (or insulator), which maintains the signal by preventing the copper conductors from touching the outer sheath. The sheath is composed of a DoubleHelix construction, which adds durability. Within the connectors at the ends, the company uses a technique it calls heavy-duty, internal, dual-strain relief, which increases durability and maintains the signal.","The Monster 1000HD Ultimate High-Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet is a good HDMI cable, but its price is a hard pill to swallow when cheaper cables like the <a href=\"/monoprice-review\">Monoprice Select</a> give you the exact same performance. What you&#39;re buying here is extra durability, which is only beneficial for very long runs – and that&#39;s not something most people need to worry about. However, for long runs, this is one of the best HDMI cables."]},"id":"11cf5370-ba24-49ce-9ca8-f5873258ac23","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53527","url":"/monster-1000hd-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-30T20:19:51Z","datePublished":"2011-08-30T20:19:51Z","name":"Monster 1000HD Ultimate High-Speed","synopsis":"The Monster 1000HD Ultimate High-Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet supports all audiovisual technologies available today.
