You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Nipro Diagnostics TRUEresult <a href=\"/health-and-beauty/health-care\">glucose monitor</a> is the star of the company. This inexpensive unit is easy to use and is clinically proven accurate by 99 percent of the new users polled.","The TRUEresult meter uses a small blood sample of just 0.5 microliters, and it can read levels between 20 and 600 mg/dL. It&#39;s known for fast test results of four seconds or less, which is one of the fastest times in mainstream glucose meters. This blood sugar meter also has the capability to give you up to four different reminders, including a reminder to check for ketones when the blood glucose test results go above a specified level. It also displays the day of the week, and its internal memory can store up to 500 test results.","Each TRUEtest testing strip uses Nipro&#39;s patented TRUEfill technology to collect an exact sample and create a precise reading. These strips require no coding, and you can test on your fingertips or on your forearms. A handy strip release button on the face of the unit expels the test strips so that you don&#39;t have to handle them with your hands after testing.","This compact unit measures 3.52 inches by 2.16 inches by 0.69 inches, so it easily fits into a purse, backpack or briefcase. It uses one CR2032 battery and weighs just 1.66 ounces with the battery installed. The TRUEresult meter comes with a lifetime warranty.","Nipro Diagnostics also offers diabetes management software called TRUEmanager. TRUEmanager&#39;s reports include daily and weekly modal reports, glucose trends and logbook reports. Nipro&#39;s software package requires a Windows operating system, Adobe reader and an Intel Pentium IV processor or higher. There is also a separate TRUEmanager Pro version for health care professionals so they can also upload your testing results. The company also offers a full section of diabetic resources on its website that includes insurance information, diabetic facts, meter support and how-to guides.","The TRUEresult is an accurate glucose test meter, and the company touts the clinical trials and testing against some other well-known glucose monitors that back its accuracy claim. The unit is difficult to find in stores. However, the features and low cost make it worth the hunt."]},"id":"18a2c8a2-95f1-4084-a640-f65451d74402","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60914","url":"/trueresult-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-23T15:54:15Z","datePublished":"2014-10-23T15:54:15Z","name":"TRUEresult","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-10-23T15:54:15Z","id":"qbBWGvNBUKCgoiPv3BFDNh","meta":{"title":"TRUEresult Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The TRUEresult glucometer gives accurate results with fast test times and small samples.
