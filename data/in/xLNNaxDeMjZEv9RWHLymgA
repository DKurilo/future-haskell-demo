The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-car-speakers\">Car Speakers</a> here.</em>","The best car speaker in the Rockford Fosgate Power Series is the 6 x 9-inch, three-way, rear deck speaker. Of all the speaker sizes in the series, this is the only three-way coaxial speaker, which means it has two tweeters and a woofer. Since the two tweeters produce the midrange and high frequencies, the audio is more balanced and defined. One of the problems with two-way coaxial speakers is the lack of midrange detail. The high treble and bass dominate, leaving a significant hole in the middle, which is where you hear most of the detail. You won&#39;t have this problem with the three-way speaker.","The sensitivity rating for the Power series was among the lowest we reviewed. The 6.5-inch speaker has a sensitivity rating of 88dB and the rear speakers have a sensitivity of 90dB. This rating represents the volume measured at one meter from the speaker using only one watt of power. For every 3dB increase in a sensitivity rating, the power needed to produce the same volume divides in half. For example, if you use 100 watts to turn these Rockford Fosgate speakers up to 11, then a speaker with a sensitivity rating of 91dB can produce the same volume with only 50 watts.","One of the biggest complaints among users of the 6x9-inch rear speaker is the large mounting depth. Nothing is more deflating than buying a speaker and finding out that it doesn&#39;t fit. At 3.43 inches, it&#39;s on the deeper end of the mounting depth spectrum, making it less likely to fit comfortably in your car. However, the 6.5-inch speakers have one of the shallowest mounting depths available at 1.99 inches.","Rockford Fosgate has excellent customer support. Not only do the speakers come with a full one-year warranty, but you can also get information about wiring, amp optimization, woofer box construction and more. One of the best features is the Fanatic Forum page where car audio enthusiasts can share ideas about how the get the best sound out of your speaker system. If you have a keen interest in car audio, then Rockford Fosgate&#39;s support page is a great educational tool."]},"id":"f4edd4ba-ac41-4ed8-95f7-061603652b57","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9ffdda8f-237f-4622-a4c8-b5cfbfdd6c0f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Rockford Fosgate Prime series of car door speakers has an excellent, three-way, 6 x 9-inch rear deck speaker that will produce very balanced audio throughout the 50Hz to 22kHz frequency range.
