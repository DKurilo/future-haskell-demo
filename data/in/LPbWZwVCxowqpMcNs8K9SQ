You&#39;ll find many different types of beds available, from spring to pillow top. But of all the bed types out there, the most technologically advanced and proven style of bed to relieve pressure on your back and hips at night is the memory foam mattress. It&#39;s a temperature- and pressure-sensitive visco-elastic material that conforms to the shapes of your body when you lie in bed. Three memory foam mattresses within the market are the <a href=\"/best-mattress\">Simmons Phenom</a>, <a href=\"/best-mattress\">Sarah Peyton</a> and the <a href=\"/amerisleep-review\">Amerisleep Liberty Bed</a>.","<strong>Memory Foam Mattresses: What to Look For</strong>","As almost all memory foam mattress reviews indicate, the material used for these mattress types is quite innovative and advanced, relying on chemical reactions to your body&#39;s heat in order to facilitate conforming to your body&#39;s shape. This reaction and support is ultimately dependent on how the mattress is made, which ultimately comes down to the main points specified below.","<strong>Thickness</strong><br/>The thickness of even the best memory foam mattress varies from less than eight to more than 13 inches. While almost any thickness of mattress will provide relief at your pressure points, you should consider the depth of your current mattress and how the change will affect you. A thinner mattress tends to be less expensive, with the tradeoff of providing less support and not working with platform beds. In comparison, the more-expensive best foam mattresses will provide a much more supportive sleeping experience.","<strong>Support</strong><br/>The purpose of any memory or gel memory foam mattress is to provide support for all areas of your body and to relieve pressure points. Removing that tension ensures that you&#39;ll wake up less often with the need to adjust positions and thus will wake up more rested. These mattresses come in varying levels of firmness that range from very firm to pillow top. Each firmness grade will provide a different level of support for your body and can dramatically impact the way you sleep.","<strong>Construction</strong><br/>The construction of a memory foam mattress consists of combining levels of memory foam on top of a traditional mattress. Each layer of memory foam used is designed differently to create levels of support and dispersion of weight for increased levels of comfort. The design of these mattresses removes your ability to flip the mattress to create even levels of use, although the design of memory foam counterbalances the need to rotate a mattress over time.","<strong>Warranty</strong><br/>The average human spends an approximate total of six years of his life sleeping, which means you need a bed that will make those countless hours seem like less of an eternity. When a bed loses its level of support and body indentations begin to appear, you&#39;ll know that nights of waking up frequently to change positions are on the horizon. A good memory foam mattress will have a lengthy warranty period in place to replace used mattresses when their level of support begins to dwindle.","Buying a new bed is a long-term investment that is well worth the expense. Getting a good night&#39;s rest will increase your energy, productivity and health during the day, enabling you to live each day to the fullest. By performing thorough research and reading the best memory foam mattress reviews, you can make an informed decision when you&#39;re ready to buy."]},"id":"8be3e7f2-c3eb-424f-b2d2-994477397b5c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"91f61f2f-b996-437e-9b3c-b4c4971f43b7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IUBIZM/?&tag=ttr_memory-foam-mattress-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1089[art|NA[pid|56759[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Amerisleep Liberty Bed</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050JL4TC/?&tag=ttr_memory-foam-mattress-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1089[art|NA[pid|56760[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">LUCID by LinenSpa</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RWK76G/?&tag=ttr_memory-foam-mattress-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1089[art|NA[pid|56761[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sarah Peyton</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sealy-Optimum-Inspiration-Firm-Mattress/dp/B01EK76FFM/?tag=ttr_memory-foam-mattress-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1089[art|NA[pid|56762[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sealy Optimum Inspiration</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PEJ1NY/?&tag=ttr_memory-foam-mattress-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1089[art|NA[pid|56763[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Serta Gel Foam</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1HB6C/?&tag=ttr_memory-foam-mattress-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1089[art|NA[pid|56764[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">SilverRest Luxury Grand</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPMODC/?&tag=ttr_memory-foam-mattress-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1089[art|NA[pid|56765[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">SilverRest Therapeutic</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017Z6WXWO/?&tag=ttr_memory-foam-mattress-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1089[art|NA[pid|56766[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Simmons Phenom</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CT37L0/?&tag=ttr_memory-foam-mattress-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1089[art|NA[pid|56767[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Sleep Innovations</a>","<a href=\"http://www.tempurpedic.com/TEMPUR-Contour-Collection/Tempur-Pedic-TEMPUR-Contour-Select.asp\">Tempur-Pedic Contour Select</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"887a3745-862a-401e-b3d9-6f2f97b0203b","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1089","url":"/best-memory-foam-mattresses","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-05-31T16:00:45Z","datePublished":"2013-07-01T21:28:14Z","name":"Memory Foam Mattresses Review","synopsis":"Memory foam mattresses are widely reputed to be among the most comfortable bed materials, providing an unparalleled level of comfort.","review":{},"strapline":"Memory foam mattresses are widely reputed to be among the most comfortable bed materials, providing an unparalleled level of comfort.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-08-17T21:47:00Z","id":"LPbWZwVCxowqpMcNs8K9SQ","meta":{"title":"The Best Memory Foam Mattresses - Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
