Its feather-light weight of 0.3 ounces increases this memory stick&#39;s portability. Although Verbatim claims transfer speeds of 175MBps, our testing revealed the V3 Max&#39;s performance to be a little lackluster. This isn&#39;t the best USB flash drive on the market, but this <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-cheap-usb-flash-drives\">USB 3.0 flash drive</a> still far outperforms any USB 2.0 drive.","In a nutshell, the V3 Max&#39;s performance is average. Its read and write speeds don&#39;t particularly impress (126MBps sequential read and 65MBps sequential write), but they&#39;re fast enough to make most tasks manageable. The one thing you need to know is that the drive&#39;s 4K random read and write performance isn&#39;t good enough to run any application or operating systems off of this flash drive.","The Store &#39;n&#39; Go comes in three different capacities: 16GB, 32GB and 64GB. This USB drive has a hard plastic casing, but there is no loop for connecting it to a lanyard or key chain. This pen drive is for general use and is not suitable for rugged exposure or careless transport.","Unlike many USB drives, the Verbatim USB drive does not come with a data-transfer indicator light, online backup or data restoration. An indicator light is helpful if you want to know if the flash drive device is communicating with the host device. You do have the option of downloading password-protection software to safeguard the device or specific files on the device. The software also protects your files with 256-bit AES encryption. Beware that if you incorrectly type in your password 10 times, the EasyLock software erases all encrypted files stored on the drive.","This USB flash drive is compatible with both PCs and Macs. The V3 Max comes with a generous lifetime warranty, which you can view in detail on the company&#39;s website. Support documentation, such as the user manual and instructions for the EasyLock password-protection software, are also available online. However, FAQs and community forum information are rather scant on the site. Verbatim does provide technical support via email, telephone and live chat."]},"id":"da7f34bc-3425-4292-b8bb-adaedabfa68e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"35c6ecf9-0502-4c90-938d-26759a12a6e0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Verbatim Store &#39;n&#39; Go V3 Max is a solid but basic external flash drive.

However, if your drive requirements are simple, this USB flash drive will work well for you.
