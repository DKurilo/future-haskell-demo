The around-the-ear, semi-open design allows low frequencies to come through loud and clear without overpowering the rest of the music. Because of their semi-open design, expect a lot of sound to bleed out and to have weak sound isolation. This makes headphones in the K series a poor fit for DJs and those planning to use them in crowded areas or while recording.","Because of their impedances, some of the headphones sound slightly softer when used with low-voltage portable devices. You can still enjoy great audio from portable devices, but you may want to consider using an amplifier to get the full sound experience.","Even with their semi-open design, these AKG stereo headphones produce clear and nearly flawless treble. Cymbals and synthesizers sound like they belong in the mix and are never too bright or harsh. The midrange frequencies come through incredibly clean. The K series headphones really shine when you listen to live performances, and if you close your eyes, you can almost see where every instrument is placed in the mix. Still, while the bass level is tight and crisp, it lacks in the boom department, making bass-heavy music, such as rap, techno or R&amp;B, less enjoyable.","These stereo headphones weigh in at around 8.5 ounces, which means they are very light and can be worn comfortably for extended listening sessions. AKG chose to use soft velvet to cover the earpads on some of its K series headsets instead of artificial leather. The velvet feels great and wicks away moisture from your ears when the weather is warm. As with all over-ear headsets, if your ears are large or otherwise do not fit properly into the ear cups, you might find them uncomfortable after wearing them for a while.","The only accessory included in the box is a threaded gold-plated 1/4-inch adapter plug to use with an amplifier, home stereo equipment or studio equipment. The AKG K series headphones don’t come with a carrying case. Since there is a 10-foot cable already built in to the headphones, you don’t really need an extension. If the ear pads wear out, they are easy to replace and can be purchased from AKG&#39;s website.","AKG K series stereo headphones are covered by a two-year warranty. You can contact AKG by email and by telephone if you have any questions. The company’s website does not have online chat support, documentation downloads or FAQs pages.","The AKG K series stereo headphones have solid construction and lightweight frames that are comfortable for long listening sessions. While these headsets produce excellent, high-definition sound quality – especially with rock, country, jazz and classical music – they lack in bass performance."]},"id":"7a05a973-0d3d-4833-9a99-56f7d3bf953e","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_50440","url":"/akg-k-242-hd-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2010-08-16T19:13:56Z","datePublished":"2010-08-16T19:13:56Z","name":"AKG K Series","synopsis":"With about a 15 to 25,000Hz frequency response, depending on the model you choose, the stereo headphones in the AKG K series reproduce hefty lows and soaring highs.
