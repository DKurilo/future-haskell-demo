This set would do a lot of tasks just fine, but we think other <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43718-best-microscopes-for-kids.html\">kids microscopes</a> we researched would do them better.","The one sure beauty with this product is a low price point.","There are some useful tools in the set, including three collecting vials, three plastic slide covers, a stirring rod, spatula, scalpel, needle pen, illuminator lamp and two circular specimen trays.","A mechanical stage will help young scientists make fine adjustments to their microscopic views by allowing control along both axes.","It should be noted there is illumination with this scope. Even at this low price Vivitar took it out of the mirror-only range. That’s going to benefit children who live anywhere it is not sunny every single day.","Sturdy die-cast construction is always a good thing for a kids microscope. Never underestimate the potential for your child’s brand new toy to get toppled or even tossed. Between that and the cordless design, this instrument scores some points for ease of use.","Some prepared slides would have been nice. Even one would be enough to get the inspiration flowing and get your kids off the couch. Once they got a look at what they could find they would be on their way, possibly to the kitchen in search of celery, or to the nearest pond.","Kids would want more than the three slides and three collecting vials Vivitar included in this set though, for sure. We give them some leeway because of the lower price point, but at the end of the day it does not cost much to throw in a few more slides.","You get the most basic instructions with this kit. Do not expect anything fancy.","This company stands behind its products with a solid one-year warranty that is easy to find on the company’s website.","Their customer service over the phone was not the best. Possibly we caught them at a bad time, but we got some mighty hazy and unenthused answers to our questions about the MIC-3.","The website is practically useless as well. There is very little description of the product and even less help in the form of online manuals or tutorials or anything really. We could not even find much information about the company itself.  What better place is there than a company website for singing a firm’s own praises?","We like this kids microscope set. It offers quite a bit for its price. The low ranking is a reflection of our recommendation to spend a little more and get a lot more, if you can."]},"id":"50bc999f-272f-4e7b-81e8-e91f9f021945","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"afad1578-5dd9-4776-aee0-8fa84ab52357","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The <strong>MIC-3</strong> scope will go through an initial period of use, but we think once the small collection of accessories gets scattered to the winds your child will forget all about this scope and so will you.
