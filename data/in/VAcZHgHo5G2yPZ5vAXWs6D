You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Citi®/AAdvantage® American Express® Card lets you earn one air mile for every dollar you spend, and you can redeem the miles you earn with this <a href=\"/best-air-miles-credit-cards\">air miles credit card</a> for travel on American Airlines and other affiliated carriers.","Although this air miles card doesn’t offer an abundance of travel benefits, you will receive a handful. For instance, you won’t run into blackout dates when you use your miles to book travel on American Airlines and other carriers, and you can receive in-fight discounts when you use your card. Additionally, you are also able to use your miles for international flights.","This Citi frequent flyer miles card offers an impressive sign-up offer for new card members. If you spend $750 in the first four months of having the card, you will receive 25,000 bonus miles. Although certain terms apply, that number of bonus miles is enough for a round trip domestic fare.","When you make specific purchases with your card, certain features automatically kick in. For instance, when you purchase your flight or other travel fare with your Citi air miles card, you will automatically be covered by travel accident insurance, rental car insurance and lost luggage reimbursement if they apply. Furthermore, if you purchase a product that includes a manufacturer warranty, it may qualify for an extended product warranty. This card also includes purchase protection, zero liability and 24/7 roadside assistance.","This Citi air miles card doesn’t offer an introductory annual percentage rate, but the standard APR you may qualify for is already fairly low. For purchases and balance transfers you make with this card, your APR will be 13.99%-21.99% Variable. If you make any cash advance transactions, the APR will be 25.24% Variable. Furthermore, this card also has a 29.99% Variable penalty APR.","The first year you have the card, the annual fee is waived, but following the initial 12 months, you can expect the annual fee to be $50, which isn’t too bad. Additionally, the rest of the fees are pretty standard. Cash advance transactions will cost you a minimum $10 or 5% fee, while any balance transfers you make will see a minimum $5 or 3% fee tacked on. Additionally, if you travel abroad and use the card, you will see a 3% fee associated with each purchase you make.","Getting member support is important, so we were a tad disappointed that the only way you can contact Citi for support is via phone. However, you can also reference a bunch of frequently asked questions on its website if you need more general questions answered."]},"id":"7e737b65-9a5c-4d51-b90b-1df703e93853","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"83f24c90-a05f-47ab-ab2e-55bdc8ee1a2d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Citi®/AAdvantage® American Express® Card has a low annual percentage rate for individuals that qualify, and you will also enjoy a waived annual fee for the first 12 months.
