We examined software applications thoroughly, contacted manufacturers to ask questions, and checked online blogs and consumer reviews to find an extensive and wide-ranging selection.","We read numerous food-related articles by celebrity chefs as well as non-celebrity – but highly educated – home economists at county extension offices throughout the U.S.","We also relied on our own cooking abilities and knowledge to evaluate what would be practical for most households and cooks, who typically are pressed for time and welcome help in planning, shopping and preparing meals.","<strong>How Much Does Recipe Software Cost?</strong>","The cost of recipe software varies as some are subscription-based and others come at a one-time purchase price with subsequent software updates for an additional cost. Most, however, cost between $20 and $30 to install but others like Cook’n cost $80.","<strong>Meal Delivery Kits</strong>","Prepackaged meal kits – such as those from Blue Apron, Home Chef and HelloFresh – have become popular in recent years. If you subscribe to one of these services, you can still use recipe software. The meal kits arrive with preportioned ingredients and recipes, but what if you want to try something a little different? If you decide to leave any ingredients out of a recipe, don&#39;t throw them away. Instead, use them later. Enter the name of the ingredient you didn&#39;t use into a recipe software program or app, and it will show you recipes containing that ingredient. That means your unused veggies won&#39;t go to waste.","<br/>If you love the recipes included in your meal delivery kit, you can use recipe software to file them for later. Most of the recipes are printed on paper or cardboard, making them easy to lose. When you store the recipes electronically on your laptop or smartphone, you won’t have to search your entire kitchen for them later. Recipe software is also useful for people who are very comfortable in the kitchen. If you received a meal kit coupon as a gift but don’t typically like following instructions, simply use the ingredients however you see fit and create your own recipes. You can then save them for later in your recipe software or app.","<strong>Features to Look for When Buying Cookbook and Recipe Software</strong>","Multiple Functions<br/>Look for software that makes life easier by creating menus and grocery lists as well as offering nutritional information, cost analysis for groceries and suggestions for dishes you can prepare with what’s in your <a href=\"/best-refrigerators-review\">refrigerator</a> and pantry.","Clear Organization<br/>This software is intended to replace those easily misplaced 3-by-5-inch cards stuffed into a box and your hardcover cookbooks, so it’s important to get programs that manage your recipes. With the best software, you can edit recipes to suit your palate, and you can search by category, menu item or ingredient so you can find the recipe you’re looking for with only a click of the mouse or swipe of the finger.","Help With Special Dietary Needs<br/>If you or someone in your household is allergic to a particular ingredient, you would do well to get software that quickly offers a safe substitute ingredient or a safe similar recipe.","Recipe and Ingredient Management<br/>The best cookbook and recipe software offers recipe suggestions and allows you to import recipes found online into your personal database.
