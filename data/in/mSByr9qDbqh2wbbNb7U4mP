It submerges food in the oil, and its revolving basket continually pulls the food out and then re-submerges it. With this system, we fried 2 pounds of food using less oil than with any of the other fryers we tested. This 1,500-watt <a href=\"/best-deep-fryers\">deep fryer</a> heated the oil to 375 degrees Fahrenheit in 14 minutes, which is about average for the fryers we reviewed.","It took longer than average to cook breaded chicken tenders and French fries in this DeLonghi fryer, but with a little patience, it made juicy chicken with moderately crispy breading – the breading eventually reached a light brown color that wasn’t quite golden. Our taste testing panel was impressed with the meat’s flavor, and some of the panel members preferred this fryer’s chicken to the crispier strips made with other models. The fries were also marginally crispy on the outside but had a nice consistency and flavor. The Cool Touch Deep Fryer has an angled viewing window designed to minimize condensation, but quite a bit of grease still blocked our view inside.","This small deep fryer has a unique look and some unique features that makes it safer than the average deep fryer. It looks more like a rice cooker than a deep fryer, and its interior is even about the size of a rice cooker. Also like a rice cooker, its exterior never heated up above touchable temperatures – around 101 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s warm, but not hot enough to burn kids’ fingers, so it is a good option if you have a family. However, you must always be careful when deep fat frying.","Another nice safety feature is you can close the lid before depressing a lever that submerges food into the hot oil. Deep fryers splatter a lot when you add food to the oil, and the lid contains the splatter, which lowers the risk of burns. When your food is ready, you lift the lever to raise the basket out of the oil so it can drain before you empty it. The DeLonghi also comes with a magnetic safety cord and skid-resistant feet.","This fryer isn’t difficult to clean, but it presents some unique challenges. It’s easy to drain oil with the hidden spout on the front of the fryer, which you access by opening a panel. However, the DeLonghi doesn’t come with a removable vat or container to store the oil in. You can clean the machine with a wet cloth, but it’s a little awkward since nothing comes apart, except the basket.","This home deep fryer comes with a one-year warranty. If you prefer longer coverage, check out <a href=\"/cuisinart-review\">Cuisinart Compact Deep Fryer CDF-100C</a> – it is an economically priced unit with a three-year warranty."]},"id":"a07fc5ed-297c-4f37-b5fc-43ace782ac4f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59015","url":"/delonghi-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-03-06T14:41:08Z","datePublished":"2014-03-06T14:41:08Z","name":"DeLonghi D677UX","synopsis":"In our testing, the DeLonghi Cool Touch Deep Fryer D677UX produced good fried chicken strips with just 1 liter of oil.
