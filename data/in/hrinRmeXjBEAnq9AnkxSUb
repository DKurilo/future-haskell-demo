The Technivorm Moccamaster line of coffee makers look a bit intricate, but they are actually simple to use and heat the water to the optimal brewing temperature for getting the best possible taste from coffee grounds (between  198-205°F).","Of this line, the Technivorm Moccamaster KBT-741 uses a thermal carafe with a double lining that will keep your coffee nice and warm once it is brewed. The manufacturer recommends that you enhance this even more by rinsing the carafe in warm water before starting to make a pot of coffee.","If you want, you can opt for a Technivorm coffee maker that uses a glass carafe.","The Technivorm Moccamaster KBT-741 makes 10 cups of coffee. When you pour water into the reservoir, it goes down into the body of the machine where it is heated, then up through a shower arm, from which it is sprayed into the coffee grounds. The resulting brew drips into the carafe via a special &#34;brew through&#34; lid. To keep the coffee hot after it is done, you can always replace that lid with another, regular lid if you want.","Coffee lovers who favor the cone-shaped filters for grounds will be delighted to know that this device uses the cone shape, which they maintain keeps the grounds and hot water in contact longer and releases the fullest possible flavor. You can use either a gone tone permanent filter or paper filter for the coffee grounds, depending on your preference.","If you are in a hurry, you are in luck: This automatic drip coffee maker is built with the brew pause function that lets you quickly snag a cup during the brewing process. The device then resumes brewing the rest of the pot.","Speaking of coffee pots, you can brew a full one or you can choose to brew between two and five cups if you want a smaller amount of coffee.","Unfortunately, this is not a programmable coffee maker, so you cannot set it up the night before and expect freshly made coffee in the morning.","If you run into any difficulties, you can contact the company through its email or phone support. You also get the best coffee maker warranty with this device  –  a full five-years  – which is the longest warranty of any coffee maker we reviewed."]},"id":"9e91e574-930a-4cbc-a944-b85f861e9ae7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6b5e3fd6-f3f4-41fc-96da-054e74f29ff8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["You do not get certain extra features with this coffee maker, such as the ability to program it overnight.
