Exceptional balance and stability make this power tiller a popular choice, offering safety and ease of use. The counterweights put more weight on the wheels, giving better traction and stability, even when tilling rough or uneven terrain. When you&#39;re performing tough tilling tasks, working in heavy clay or across difficult terrain, the CRT900 features a drag bar that stabilizes the <a href=\"/best-tillers\">tiller</a> and makes the task safer and easier. This rototiller also boasts agricultural tires for optimum traction.","To increase ease of use, this gas tiller boasts a vertically adjustable handlebar, allowing you to find a comfortable tilling position for your height. For extra convenience, you can find the gear lever on the handlebar, within easy reach. This Husqvarna rototiller only offers forward and reverse gear options, so there&#39;s no way to alter speed or power. However, the inclusion of the reverse gear definitely makes tilling far easier, as you can simply change into reverse gear and walk backward while still tilling, negating the need to lift and turn the tiller before tilling back over each row.","The counter-rotating, rear-facing tines boast deep soil penetration, breaking up clumps and creating a beautifully fine soil structure. This makes planting easier and increases plant yield. Popular for its versatility, the Husqvarna CRT900 has an adjustable tilling depth, with seven adjustment levels, up to a depth of 6 inches. This gives you the freedom to use the tiller for light, moderate and heavy-duty tasks, including cutting new beds and light weeding between planted rows. Unfortunately, the 14-inch tilling width isn&#39;t adjustable. However, if you are more interested in cutting new ground or general annual soil maintenance, this isn&#39;t so much of a concern. Additionally, as long as you leave a minimum of 14 inches between rows, you&#39;ll have plenty of space to get the tiller in between.","The reliable 205 cc easy-start Briggs &amp; Stratton engine offers plenty of power for most tasks, and the 3-quart fuel tank means you won&#39;t have to stop to refuel too frequently. The powerful engine provides a tine rotation speed of 210 rpm, quickly tackling even heavy clay soil or virgin ground.","While this Husqvarna gas tiller lacks frills and accessories, for a midrange machine it offers plenty of features. Overall it is a solid, reliable workhorse for medium to large growing areas, versatile enough to cope with almost any tilling task."]},"id":"a8795867-d885-461e-8838-36c843e58c62","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_62711","url":"/husqvarna-crt900-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-02-11T22:11:34Z","datePublished":"2015-02-11T22:11:34Z","name":"Husqvarna CRT900","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.
