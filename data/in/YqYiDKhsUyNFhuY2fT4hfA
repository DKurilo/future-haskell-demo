Instead of listening to live music or a DJ through speakers or a sound system, partygoers wear <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988-2.html\">Bluetooth headphones</a> and wirelessly listen. Outsiders only see a group of crazy people dancing without any music, but silent disco attendees are all listening simultaneously to the same gig.","Silent discos range in scope from large festivals, to concerts, to mobile clubbing. Although you miss out on the heart-thudding bass from loud speakers, listening with headphones actually gives you a more authentic experience. For example, when listening to a live band, it doesn&#39;t matter where you&#39;re standing in the venue, you&#39;ll experience the same raw, well-balanced sound the band hears through their headsets.","Enjoying a silent disco set with a group of friends is surprisingly more convenient than attending a traditional event. You never have to worry about a noise curfew and the party can last all night without disturbing the peace. You can also skip the hearing aids as most of the best Bluetooth headphones allow you to control the volume right on the ear cup. If you want to have a quick conversation without leaving the venue or having to yell, simply take off your headphones and put them back on again when you&#39;re ready to boogie."]},"id":"526215a9-53d0-41b5-b7b4-e5e789313d1e","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/vsCFzvS2XgFPFVY8QLwwQE.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"se consumer models can pull double duty at your silent disco party one night, and produce high-class audio at the office the next day.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/misc/articles/8880/best-bluetooth-3.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vsCFzvS2XgFPFVY8QLwwQE.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"vsCFzvS2XgFPFVY8QLwwQE","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vsCFzvS2XgFPFVY8QLwwQE.jpg","alt":""},"id":"d3b6a533-2ff2-42d7-a802-e6d0fb868630","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With a pair of Sony MDR-10RBT Bluetooth headphones, you can rock out for up to 17 hours on the extra-long battery life.
