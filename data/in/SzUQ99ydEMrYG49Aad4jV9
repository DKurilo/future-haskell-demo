You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Pioneer is a company known for making quality electronics, and they live up to that with their Pioneer VSX-1020-K. It has all the needed features, abilities and performance capabilities you could want. Generally there is something negative about most electronics, but we had to stretch out to the remote to find a flaw this time. Since the remote can easily be replaced with a better third-party one or a universal remote, that may be the best choice.","If there had to be another flaw then we&#39;d say the warranty. It only covers you for a year, but that is pretty common for <a href=\"/best-av-receivers\">AV receivers</a>. Most are either one or two years long, which is enough time to take care of any defects usually. However, it would be nice to see a manufacture that builds a product well enough to tack on a lifetime warranty and not be worried about it coming back to bite them. It&#39;s true that no company will probably ever do that for the majority of electronics, but we can hope right?"]},"id":"7f3f95f4-933c-4ea8-aab4-e0a579459f4d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Power Handling"},"id":"ba796681-1b75-41f8-b4b6-6bdfd9d53cd7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["When it comes to overall performance and output, there wasn&#39;t much question as to which one of these fine AV receivers was superior. The Pioneer VSX-1020-K is 7.1 surround sound capable and can put out 110 watts through each speaker. Those who aren&#39;t familiar with AV receivers may find it weird that it outputs 110 watts per channel but only consumes 245 watts. The reason for that is most AV receivers like this one act as an amplifier as well. This Pioneer pulls in 245 watts and potentially outputs more than double, due to that amplification process. Although that isn&#39;t the most impressive consumption-to-output ratio we saw, it is still respectable and makes this AV receiver quite energy efficient.","The other thing we&#39;d point out here is the very low THD or total harmonic distortion. Harmonic distortion is inevitable with electronics at our current state of technology. That may not always be the case, but for now it&#39;s an issue. When it comes to how much distortion an electronic audio device like an AV receiver outputs, you want to find the lowest amount possible. As long as it&#39;s less than 1%, you shouldn&#39;t be able to hear it. All the products in this review site were under that percentage, but the Pioneer VSX-1020-K came in with the least at 0.05% distortion."]},"id":"c0de9120-280c-40a0-8489-5e54ccb024e6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Formats"},"id":"980838d8-1271-4655-b951-b984429997d9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This Pioneer AV receiver has a nice variety of input and output ports. It has everything from the common red, white and yellow composite audio and video ports to the new king of AV cables, HDMI, and everything in between. As HDMI slowly replaces most other AV connections, it&#39;ll become the only thing you really need. As it is now though there are six HDMI inputs and one output. That is enough HDMI ports to hook up most people&#39;s entire home entertainment system. Since there isn&#39;t really anything better than HDMI right now, it&#39;s nice to have that many available for use.","Aside from the regular AV ports that all AV receivers have, there are a few others included in this one that couldn&#39;t be found in most others but should be. First there is an Ethernet port for connecting your system to the internet. It doesn’t work as a router for your Blu-ray player or TV, but it does allow for internet radio. You can also hook up a wireless router to stream music from a wireless device.","The second is a USB port. The USB port can be used for easily updating the Pioneer VSX-1020-K. This is sometimes necessary if improvements via firmware are released for the AV receiver. The third port is for Bluetooth, and it is used for updates as well. Aside from updates, you can stream music from any A2DP Bluetooth or you can connect Bluetooth stereo speakers through it as well."]},"id":"53189fed-4d6e-4804-833a-5263d7f2f4db","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Connectivity"},"id":"bbc4f6a9-c66c-4cbb-8ab1-8280c7e8cb62","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Of all the AV receivers that we reviewed, the Pioneer VSX-1020-K has the broadest range of technology and format support.

The two that this one has that most of the others don’t have though, are WMA9 Pro and THX. The Onkyo TX-SR608 also has THX, but it is the only other one.

To go along with those you can stream music from your iPod, Android phone or any other similar wireless device. You can play music in multiple rooms and even calibrate the second zone to your liking. The best part about the multi- zone aspect is that it will play two different audio and video sources in separate rooms. In other words, you don&#39;t have to play the same thing over both zones. You can watch TV while your kid plays PlayStation, for example.","There is also the option of calibrating your speakers via Pioneer&#39;s MCACC or Multi-Channel-Acoustic Calibration System. It is designed to calibrate the speakers automatically to fit your room layout.
