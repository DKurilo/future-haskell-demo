You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","LiveWatch offers an abundance of choices for customizing your <a href=\"/home/smart-home/best-home-security-systems/\">home security system</a>. You can select a basic plan, one of the other, more sophisticated plans, or you can create your own unique system to safeguard you, your loved ones and your property.","LiveWatch&#39;s contract terms are the most fair in our review, giving you more control over your home security system than other companies we reviewed. The company has average customer support options and a basic equipment package that matches that of the competition.","This national company offers four home monitoring plans and two equipment packages. The Mobile Pro monitoring plan is one of the more affordable home security systems we reviewed in terms of its monthly monitoring fees. The starting costs for LiveWatch are comparable to those of other home security systems.","Your LiveWatch contract lasts for one year, shorter than the industry average of three years. After the year is up, the contract automatically renews on a month-to-month basis, which is typical of most home security systems. The contract doesn&#39;t include an early cancellation fee, making LiveWatch one of only two home alarm companies in our review without such a policy (and fees), <a href=\"/home/smart-home/best-home-security-systems/simplisafe-review/\">SimpliSafe</a> is the other. If you are dissatisfied, you can return the equipment within a year. No other company in our review offers such a generous equipment return policy.","A key selling point for LiveWatch is its ASAPer service, an alert feature that sends interactive alerts to a list of contacts you create when you set up the system. If an alert is triggered, ASAPer contacts everyone on the list simultaneously. This is substantially better than most home security systems that contact people or agencies one by one until the company finally gets an answer. Once someone answers, LiveWatch works with the individual to determine whether or not to send emergency services to your house.","With LiveWatch, you get cellular-based systems with optional internet connectivity. LiveWatch keeps tabs on your house 24/7. The wireless services are equipped with a two-way voice intercom via the control panel. This device lets you talk with a monitoring station representative through the panel in case, for some reason, you cannot get to a phone. If you trigger a sensor by mistake, you can inform the operator there is no real threat in your home. In an emergency, however, a representative can immediately contact the authorities. In addition, you can get alerts from your system&#39;s sensors through the smartphone app or through the control panel.","Self-installation is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. However, LiveWatch pledges that its pre-programmed equipment is ready for you to use and all you need to do is plug it in.","LiveWatch provides useful and convenient support options. There is a knowledgebase and support via live chat, an online ticket system and phone. You can also get customer support on LiveWatch&#39;s Facebook and Twitter accounts based on the public interactions we&#39;ve seen.","Our experiences contacting LiveWatch were pleasant with helpful and friendly operators who answered our questions. One unique thing about LiveWatch&#39;s knowledgebase is that it&#39;s searchable: You can find useful resources by typing in a keyword or topic. Considering that all of LiveWatch&#39;s home security systems are self-installed, we appreciate its range of comprehensive support options and tutorials that simplify and speed up the installation process. One drawback is that the equipment warranty is only for two years, which is relatively short in the home security industry.","Beyond home security, LiveWatch offers convenient upgrades that allow you to implement home automation. You can upgrade the system to automate your thermostat, lighting and door locks. LiveWatch offers an excellent selection of high-quality video surveillance cameras so you see remote video feeds and know what is happening in or outside your home.","You can pick an indoor fixed, indoor night-vision or a remote-controlled pan-and-tilt camera. For outdoor surveillance, you can use LiveWatch&#39;s infrared bullet camera that records in color and switches to black and white at night. This provides a night-vision range of 39 feet. For basic purposes, you might try an image sensor that captures still photos if it detects any movement.","LiveWatch&#39;s least-expensive equipment package, comes with a control panel, two door and window sensors, six window decals, two yard signs, a key fob and a motion sensor. You do not need to worry about false alarms if a pet crosses the room since the sensor does not detect pets weighing under 40 pounds.","You can augment this basic arrangement by adding as many as 40 security devices. Among other things, you also can install sirens, shock sensors and glass-break sensors to boost your system&#39;s effectiveness. You can also get add-on equipment such as sensors for carbon monoxide, natural gas leaks or frozen pipes.","LiveWatch&#39;s self-installed security systems may not be for everyone. However, the company delivers an exceptional customer-focused contract, a range of devices and around-the-clock home monitoring, which means you can set up the best home security system for your particular needs. With LiveWatch, you can do a great deal to keep your family, pets, home and possessions as safe as possible."]},"id":"5977732b-0001-4d00-926e-b373c8c2410b","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59346","url":"/livewatch-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"john-carlsen","url":"/author/john-carlsen","dateCreated":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","name":"John Carlsen","dateModified":"2019-04-02T16:19:04Z","id":"jN6fuw55cS2xYQi25mfgkg","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-16T21:46:11Z","datePublished":"2014-04-16T21:46:11Z","name":"LiveWatch (now Brinks)","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is now Brinks Home Security.
