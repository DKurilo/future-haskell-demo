You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.<br/></em>","VOVSoft Blu-ray Copy is the Swiss army knife of optical disc burning. It can do most anything you can imagine for DVDs and CDs, but also features compatibility with Blu-ray. Better still, this <a href=\"/best-blu-ray-burning-software\">Blu-ray burning software</a> package comes in a clean and well-polished case—burning Blu-ray Discs can be technical and frustrating, but the simple layout really takes away the sting. In addition to burning and copying Blu-ray Discs, the application also offers a host of excellent options; unfortunately, some of the best features are restricted to DVD.","VOVSoft is great for creating duplicate discs, regardless of the media format (be they Blu-ray, DVD or CD). It is also capable of saving virtual discs to your hard drive, which eliminates the need for two disc drives if you want to make a copy.","If you have a large amount of data to burn, and it won&#39;t fit on a single disc (which is no small feat, considering the Blu-ray&#39;s impressive 25GB minimum capacity), never fear; VOVSoft is also equipped to split your data into multiple portions that can be burned on separate discs. And if you want to preserve some of your favorite music along with your Route 66 slideshow parts 1, 2 and 3, you can do that too, thanks to mixed media support. This application&#39;s primary strength with Blu-ray burning, however, lies largely in the creation of backup and storage discs.","To fill a 25GB Blu-ray Disc, VOVSoft should not take much longer than 46 minutes to burn (though burning speed fluctuates based on your computer and Blu-ray drive.) This is the fastest burn speed we clocked in our tests, far above-average for Blu-ray burning software. We collected these figures from a timed burn test conducted on a 511MB video file.","Installation was a breeze. We were able to get the program running approximately two minutes after the download completed. Installation itself was straightforward, requiring only eight mouse clicks and no reboot. Even beginning users will be able to get the application ready to burn.","If you have any problems as you burn Blu-ray Discs, VOVSoft has provided multiple resources to help you get things resolved. You&#39;ll find tutorials and FAQs on their website, along with live chat support."]},"id":"8be50eb9-83d4-4c37-a910-e69a95f70c32","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"00e850ec-113b-4541-ad0c-db0da327e237","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["VOVSoft Blu-ray Copy is a great Blu-ray burning software package, if you’re focusing on data discs.
