We also held and maneuvered each clipper for 12 minutes – the average time a men’s haircut takes – to get a feel for how well and how comfortably the products fit in our testers’ hands. This is how we assessed each clipper’s grip, how bulky it felt, how durable it seemed and whether it tired a tester’s hands and wrists during the testing process. We also checked to see how hot each motor got during operation.","We tested the battery life and recharging time of each cordless clipper. We compared our results with each manufacturer’s reports and noted any discrepancies. Finally, we subjected all 10 products in our lineup to real-life performance tests.  Enlisting the expertise of Rebekah Christensen, a licensed stylist with more than 20 years of hairstyling experience, we invited three men and two children to receive professional haircuts. Because we wanted to balance the expertise of the professionals involved in our testing with the nuances of nonprofessional use, I also recruited three of my own sons to participate in the testing and, with only marginal protest from them, personally cut their hair.","<strong>Clippers vs. Trimmers</strong>","While very similar, clippers and trimmers serve two different purposes. Clippers are best for long hair and come with attachments to vary the length of the cut. They are good for thinning thick hair or beards. You can also use clippers on pets with long fur if you don&#39;t want to pay for a groomer.","Trimmers are built to cut finer hairs and are typically smaller though some come with larger attachments. These machines can cut hair very close to the skin and are great for attaining a close shave. This is also the route to take if you have sensitive skin, as clippers can be more abrasive.","<strong>Finding Electric Hair Clippers That Make the Cut</strong>","Choosing the best electric hair clippers is not a one-size-fits-all process. When you’re looking for clippers, some of the most important factors to consider include the specific features and accessories you want, your own level of haircutting experience and, as expected, quality and price. Rebekah Christensen, who obtained her training from California Beauty College in Modesto, California, also advises consumers to look for solid manufacturing.","“People sometimes think lighter is better,” she said, “but I feel like a clipper needs to have some weight on it. I’d rather have something that has guts. Also, if you want to be able to cut through hair with nice, clean lines, you’ve got to look for power. A lot depends, of course, on the skills of the stylist, but if you’re using something gutless and slow, you’re not going to get good results no matter how much skill or experience you have.”","Here are some other tips to help you choose the electric hair clippers best suited for your needs:<br/><br/>Price<br/>The price of electric hair clippers designed for home use can range from under $10 to several hundred dollars. To put that cost in context, it’s not unusual for professional stylists to pay over $1,000 for their clippers. We tested high-quality home haircutting kits with midrange prices between about $25 and $100.","Cord Length<br/>“I’ve gotten so cordless clippers are my favorite,” said stylist Amy Thurgood, “but length is the key if you’re using clippers with a cord.&#34;","Thurgood completed her professional training at the Avalon School of Cosmetology in Layton, Utah, and said she recommends the longer the better in terms of cord length because a longer cord “will give you more movement and free range.”"]},"id":"0b283870-0d83-4ad3-a404-f24cb8277764","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/noecZrAcr8BcosRgz7Yixm.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/electric-hair-clippers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9IL0svNzY3ODY0L29yaWdpbmFsLzQuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/noecZrAcr8BcosRgz7Yixm.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"noecZrAcr8BcosRgz7Yixm","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/noecZrAcr8BcosRgz7Yixm.jpg","alt":""},"id":"c309aee8-16ba-4e04-b50c-aa01526f2792","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Quality of Attachments and Accessories<br/>Both Christensen and Thurgood recommend you choose clippers with durable, high quality attachments that fasten securely and can be easily changed. According to Thurgood, the quality of guard combs is so important that professional stylists will often invest $30 to $40 apiece to upgrade to metal guard combs instead of using the plastic guard combs that come standard with most clippers.","“When you keep in mind that we prefer metal in the salon,” she said, “it’s especially important that the plastic guard combs you use at home are durable. If you have to choose between quantity and quality, I’d choose quality every time.”","This perspective cross-applies to accessories. “Professional scissors can cost up to $5,000 a set,” Thurgood said. “Even though that’s not feasible in the home market, you can still find scissors made of good quality metal, and you can look for styling combs and other accessories that aren’t flimsy.”","Thurgood recommends 5 ½-inch scissors for the most versatility, and she says better attachments almost always make for better haircuts."]},"id":"4ac4b1a1-e112-4b70-b751-9579f2aef2b8","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/gNktX8TByX9kwXy5PMDZsF.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/electric-hair-clippers/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9IL0wvNzY3ODY1L29yaWdpbmFsLzIuanBn","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gNktX8TByX9kwXy5PMDZsF.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"gNktX8TByX9kwXy5PMDZsF","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gNktX8TByX9kwXy5PMDZsF.jpg","alt":""},"id":"ffb3bf7b-2efa-4b63-88e9-02e1ae3e969b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/>Perspective<br/>When you’re buying electric hair clippers for use at home, you’ll likely be most pleased with your purchase if you have realistic expectations. While each set of clippers we tested can provide satisfactory results, clippers designed for home use have limitations when it comes to fading, blending and achieving custom looks.","“If you’re expecting an off-the-runway look, you’re just not going to get it,” said Thurgood. “But you can find clippers that give you a good result for the price you pay.”","While each of the 10 models we tested has definite pros and cons, keep in mind that several of the units delivered great results, and we achieved acceptable haircuts with them all.","<strong>Using Clippers</strong>","Using clippers takes a little finesse and practice. We recommend trying it out in a small spot before tackling an entire haircut. If you’re new to using clippers, start out with an easy haircut with only one or two varied lengths. Start with the longest blade to cut off any bulky patches of hair. Assuming you&#39;re working on a short hairstyle, you might be able to skip this step. Cut against the growth of the hair as you go. For instance, the hair at the base of the neck grows downward, so you&#39;ll want to shave upward there. Work in a scooping motion around the head to achieve the desired length using varied blade sizes. Most short haircuts have longer hair at the top of the head that tapers down shorter as it nears the base of the neck. To achieve this, use longer blades up top and short blades near the neck.<br/>"]},"id":"47832ec9-0050-4ad3-9a3e-7da3c40e1ae9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_127","url":"/best-electric-hair-clippers","authors":[{"email":"jchristensen@toptenreviews.com","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-07T20:49:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-07T20:49:00Z","name":"Best Electric Hair Clippers of 2019","synopsis":"Here are the best electric hair clippers (including hybrid models that also trim beards) based on performance, accessories and design.","review":{},"strapline":"Here are the best electric hair clippers (including hybrid models that also trim beards) based on performance, accessories and design.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-09T19:58:33Z","id":"NsnUZZsovLXKzRp6FcuoQW","meta":{"title":"Best Hair Clippers 2019 -
