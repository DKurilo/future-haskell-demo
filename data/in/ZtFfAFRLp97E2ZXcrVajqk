This storage would be pointless if it wasn’t for the organizational elements also included with the freezer. Seven door bins and shelves, four inside shelves, a pizza shelf and two baskets aid in complete frozen food organization.

This monitor also keeps a record for up to 99 hours when the temperature goes above 23 degrees. That way, if you don’t notice the change in temperature until the next day, it has kept track of how warm the food was at certain times. Then you can make the decision of whether to get rid of the food or not based on specific data. Although Energy Star qualified, many user reviews mention how noisy this freezer is while cycling and blame it on the energy efficient label.
