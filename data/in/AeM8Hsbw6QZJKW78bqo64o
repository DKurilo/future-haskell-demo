Konuscience Zoom 1200x is one of the few models we&#39;ve reviewed that only lights object from below while costing about the same as combination models that have both a top and bottom light, which would allow you to view both slides and 3D objects. Even though it lacks a top light, this design disadvantage would not be a large issue if its views with the bottom light were high quality.","However, in our hands-on tests we found its views to be mediocre, whether if we used the battery-powered LED or the mirror as the light source. Overall, the views offered by this <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/43718-best-microscopes-for-kids.html\">microscope</a> were generally subpar, especially when you compare them to other children&#39;s microscopes. In the words of the kids on our testing panel, the images were &#34;really hard to see&#34; and the microscope was &#34;hard to operate.&#34;","Although weak in optic performance, this unit does come with most of the common accessories. The Zoom includes tweezers, a Petri dish, slides, slide covers, a scalpel, a collection vial and a needle. They are generally of decent quality too, helping aspiring scientists well on their way.","Some children&#39;s microscope sets offer a viewer, wall projector, paper projector or camera attachment. This one provides all four. That means your child can share discoveries with you and their friends with enlarged views, a slide show on the wall, a drawing or even a photograph. We consider its metal body a plus. It makes this student microscope easy for kids to use because it is less likely to be broken – in its maiden voyage or anytime soon. A sturdy construction is more likely to withstand the bumps and bruises inflicted by a budding biologist. The problem, though, is that almost everything attached to the metal body is plastic.","A strong carrying case is included, making this kit portable. The cordless design also adds to portability, and your children won’t have to be tethered to a wall (or even inside) to use the microscope. The prepared slides offer a gateway to positive early experiences, which can make creating unique slides seem more worth the time and effort it will inevitably take.","In our interactions with the company, the Konus staffers were able to answer many, but not all, of our questions. However, there’s not much on the website to fill in the blanks.  You’ll find specifications online, as well as a list of dealers. Most consumers will end up purchasing this kids microscope from a third-party vendor – Amazon.com or something similar."]},"id":"dc4b9239-746c-4261-9246-6bf25ff398f1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c1da5117-6c2b-42f6-8cd7-5f687636b69f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This is not the best kids microscope when it comes to optics, but the Konuscience Zoom 1200x has a few things going for it.
