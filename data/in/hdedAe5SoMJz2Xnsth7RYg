He stressed that the main purpose of a robotic lawn mower is to maintain grass at a consistent height daily, rather than letting it get long and then cutting it short again. This results in a healthier lawn since it reduces the trauma the grass endures on a weekly basis.","He also showed us the results around his own yard, pointing out that it takes care of spontaneous tree sprouts before they become a problem. Lindberg also sees these machines as potential friends, saying, “When you name a mower, it becomes like a pet or family member and a celebrity in the neighborhood.”","Jared Platt of Lindon Outdoor Power Equipment walked us through the benefits of choosing a more expensive mower over an entry-level model. He said the “biggest advantage for the more expensive models are GPS navigation built into the mower.” This allows the mower to map your yard and the terrain differences in specific areas and zones. You can also connect to higher-tier models through an app on your phone. These two features are great for security – if someone makes off with your mower, you can track it through the GPS.","<strong>How We Picked the Best</strong>","As a matter of course, Top Ten Reviews thoroughly examines every product we feature on our site. As we evaluated robot lawn mowers, we looked at manufacturer spec sheets and comments from real-life users. We combed through hundreds of user reviews and watched several videos posted by robot mower owners. We also consulted each model’s owner’s manual to get an idea of what it has to offer. In addition, we considered price to find models that give you the best value for your dollar.","<strong>How Much Does a Robot Mower Cost? </strong>","<br/>Even though robot lawn mowers are relatively new to the Americas, they’ve been a big hit in Europe for a long time. In fact, companies like Husqvarna have been refining the technology since the ‘90s. Now models made by huge corporations, such as the <a href=\"https://powerequipment.honda.com/lawn-mowers/miimo/\">Honda Miimo</a>, are popping up. Another part of the reason is the price. Based on our research, a robot lawn mower costs between $800 and $1,900. The mower we chose for our best budget pick costs roughly $1,000. But keep in mind, if you want a professional to install and set up the perimeter for you, it generally tacks on an extra $150 to $300 dollars for installation. ","There are many features to consider as you choose a robotic lawn mower, including how many zones it can mow, how much area it can cover and whether you can program it with a mowing schedule. If your lawn is quite large and has hills, things like slope capability and running time should also be on your list of considerations.","<strong>The Basics</strong>","First, consider how big your yard is and make sure the mower can handle it daily. Our best pick can mow up to 0.4 acres of grass – not including your house or other structures on your property – which is the top end of the models we evaluated. Others we reviewed can handle anywhere from 0.25 to 0.33 acres, which is sufficient for small to medium-size lawns.","If you have a hilly yard, pick a model that can climb up and down the inclines with ease. The mowers we reviewed can handle slopes between 22 degrees and 30 degrees, depending on the model. However, the dealers we spoke to say they’ve seen some models handle almost 45-degree inclines with little difficulty.","Even though you generally won’t notice how often your robot lawn mower returns to its base or how long it stays there, you should consider how long it takes to charge the battery, as well as how long the machine runs with a full battery. The best mowers we reviewed last about an hour right off the charger and take a little longer than that to recharge. Battery life doesn’t affect your experience or the results, but it’s a good indicator of how well the machine is designed.","<strong>Multizone Capability</strong>","Not all automatic lawn mowers travel to distinct, separate areas to cut grass – for that, you need one with multizone capability. This feature is necessary if your home or business has a small front lawn and larger back lawn that are not directly connected. In this scenario, each lawn is considered a zone. Most multizone robot mowers cover two to four zones.","<strong>Programmable</strong>","Programmable mowers can be scheduled to run on particular days at specific times. When buying a robot mower, consider how you program it and what you want it to do. You program some units from the mower base, and others can be set remotely over a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection.","<strong>Advanced Features</strong>","As convenient as most robotic lawn mowers are, there are features that put some a cut above the competition . Some models include GPS features that map your yard and track your mower if someone steals it. You can control, configure and monitor some machines from anywhere you have an internet connection via a mobile app. Some also have rain-detection technology that senses when it’s too wet to mow – a few even continue mowing during a shower.","<strong>Warranty</strong>","Considering how expensive these robot lawn mowers are, you should consider the length of the warranty. If a model breaks down early in its life span, you may be able to replace or repair it for free if you’ve registered your warranty properly. Plus, a longer warranty provides peace of mind that the manufacturer is confident the product will last a long time.","Warranty periods vary quite a bit for robot lawn mowers. The shortest warranty in our comparison was one year, for the McCulloch ROB 1000. The Worx WG794 boasts a much longer, three-year warranty. And the five-year warranty for the Denna L600 was the longest warranty in our comparison."]},"id":"d10649e3-d42b-4c20-b050-94e82ca23155","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_194","url":"/best-robot-lawn-mowers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"J.D.
