The Nuvi 2597LMT comes preloaded with all the basic features you&#39;d expect to find in a <a href=\"/best-navigation-gps\">navigation GPS</a> device, and a good majority of the advanced features that are most useful to you. These advanced features are part of why the Nuvi 2597LMT is a good option in lieu of a smartphone app.","When mounting the Nuvi 2597LMT in your car, you can choose a vertical or horizontal orientation based on your personal preference. You will have to go into the settings menu and manually change the orientation to landscape or portrait. The GPS unit has a 5-inch screen, measured diagonally, and the resolution is 480 x 272 pixels. This resolution provides good clarity and crisp lines, but more advanced models have much higher pixel counts. The LCD touchscreen is both bright and easy to see.","The Nuvi 2597LMT comes preloaded with Garmin Real Directions, which provides precise and easy-to-understand driving directions. When you approach an intersection or a turn, the device will give directions that incorporate buildings and landmarks to help you better follow the instructions. In addition to this feature, you have Garmin Traffic, which tells you if an accident has been reported up ahead or if you should reroute due to a traffic jam. To keep your eyes focused on the road and your hands on the steering wheel, Garmin Traffic will read the updates to you. The Nuvi 2597LMT also accepts voice commands and is Bluetooth compatible.","The Garmin Nuvi 2597LMT GPS system is capable of providing multiple destination routes, including routes with multiple points of interest, user-defined waypoints or both. The device will auto-sort these destinations and put them in the most efficient order for your trip. You can save up to a thousand waypoints in the device&#39;s memory, which can include your favorite restaurants, hiking spots and other fun destinations. You can also save up to a hundred routes, whether these routes are to the dog groomer and back or just to and from work. If you&#39;ve traveled a route frequently, the Nuvi 2597LMT can predict your route based on your previous driving history. However, if you&#39;re environmentally conscious (or if you pay attention to the price tag at the gas pump), you&#39;ll have to purchase the ecoRoute option separately."]},"id":"6cdcc9cf-250d-4485-a1f5-f6d717d640d9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"af3c4f5f-cc42-400e-97dd-38ae4d32aed4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Nuvi 2597LMT is a well-rounded addition to the Advanced series.
