This air purifier uses its proprietary ionizer to electromagnetically charge small particles, making them easier for the filters to capture. However, free-floating charged particles can damage sensitive lungs. To combat this issue, the PlasmaWave technology only gives the particles a weak charge, so they will dissipate more quickly than other ionized particles.","The Winix PlasmaWave starts its purification process by pulling air through a carbon pre-filter. The pre-filter removes large particles, such as hair, and reduces odors. Next, the HEPA filter captures smaller particles such as dust, pollen and allergens. Finally, the ionizer lightly charges particles as they leave the system so that they will attract other particles, making them larger and easier to capture the next time the pass through the filters. This air purification system is effective and removes many indoor pollutants. This air purification system is rather loud at its highest settings, making it better suited for general living areas instead of bedrooms.","This room air purifier comes equipped with a filter monitor to help you know when to replace your filters. When the machine is in auto mode, a basic air-quality sensor estimates the amount of airborne pollutants and adjusts the fan speed accordingly. The PlasmaWave also comes with a remote control.","Unfortunately, the PlasmaWave is missing some crucial features. There is no operation schedule that would let you conveniently set the air purifier to run at certain times. Also, this air purifier lacks an operation timer and sleep mode, so you&#39;ll have to monitor the unit and change settings it if you don&#39;t want it running 24/7.","The PlasmaWave comes with a one-year warranty to protect against damages, which is a shorter warranty than many other manufacturers offer. Also, the only online self-help feature available is a FAQs section. There is no downloadable user manual on Winix&#39;s website. Customer service representatives are available by phone and email, and they are quick to find answers and help you."]},"id":"5731cc28-a460-4180-a098-a74c482d80d1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b0d75c23-f80b-41d9-badc-7f69a4a665fd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Winix PlasmaWave ion air purifier offers excellent pollen and odor removal.
