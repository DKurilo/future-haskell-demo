But the Asobu Imperial Beverage Cup is limited and lacks features of other <a href=\"/best-thermoses\">thermoses</a>. Plus, it isn’t very secure so it’s prone to leaks and will spill if not kept upright.","This thermos has a maximum capacity of only 10 ounces. This is enough room for a single serving of tea or coffee, so it’s not suitable for all-day hydration like the <a href=\"/yeti-review\">YETI</a>. Plus, this is the amount the cup holds without the lids. If you want to put the lid on, you will have to fill the Asobu with less liquid.","During our heat tests this travel cup did a decent job of retaining heat during the three hours the manufacturer claims the Asobu will keep liquids hot. Our test water cooled by 55 degrees, which isn’t the most heat lost in our heat retention tests, but overall it lost 51 percent of its heat within two hours, which is the fastest rate of heat loss compared to all the other thermoses. We didn’t test cold retention because Asobu doesn’t make any claim for keeping liquids cold for an extended period of time.","This thermos is sleek and attractive with stainless steel walls. The outside body is very smooth with no contouring, so it feels like it can easily slip out of your hands if you’re not careful. And though the walls are insulated, the Asobu Imperial Beverage Cup still felt hot to the touch when we picked it up during our heat tests. Also, the top was difficult to put on and our testers consistently ended up with their fingers in the hot liquid or splashing themselves as the top shifted into place, causing minor burns.","Part of our testing included tipping, jostling, bouncing and shaking each thermos to see how tight the lid is. The Asobu thermos was the only product we tested that leaked. And it wasn’t a little leak. Testers easily became drenched during these tests. Based on these findings we don’t recommend this thermos for commuting. Instead the Asobu Imperial Beverage Cup is a good option to keep at your desk for a quick drink throughout your day.","This travel tumbler measures 4.5 inches high and 3 inches in diameter, so it fits well in car cup holders. It also fit a little snuggly into the stroller cup holder during testing. But because of its smooth sides and shape it wasn’t very secure so we didn’t feel confident pushing the stroller around with the Asobu in the cup holder, especially since we already knew it was prone to substantial leaks and spills.","The Asobu Imperial Beverage Cup is 100 percent dishwasher safe and is one of only three thermoses we reviewed that is. This is probably the biggest perk. And because it doesn’t have threads for the lid, it’s easy to get everything cleaned out without worrying about food or drink getting caught."]},"id":"22a4f5bf-d8ae-4c34-9103-f49e285793b1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1c2fcb1c-a2f8-44c6-82fd-6cb08429501b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":[" As a simple, single-serve thermos with an attractive style, the Asobu beverage cup offers reasonable value. Disappointingly, however, it is not leak-proof, and the lid is easy to push too far into the mug.
