The Onkyo BD-SP309 brings up the rear of top 10 list simply because of mathematical bad luck. It is a perfectly capable machine that plays your 3D movies as well as the rest of the products on our lineup. The only thing that will prevent you from enjoying 3D movies with this player is your television&#39;s ability to display 3D content.","Ideally, you&#39;ll want to use this Onkyo 3D Blu-ray player with one of the company&#39;s high-powered home theater systems. That is not a necessity, but the symbiotic relationship Onkyo products have with one another increases the performance of all the devices in the system.","This 3D Blu-ray player is the pinnacle of digital player technology. Not only does it play 3D Blu-ray Discs, but it also plays every form of disc media available today, including non 3D Blu-ray Discs, DVDs and CDs. It also accepts signals from an Ethernet connection, which allows you to connect this player to the internet and take advantage of several preinstalled apps, including Netflix and Vudu. Other connectivity available on the Onkyo BD-SP309 includes HDMI and USB ports in the front and rear.","There are a few connection options missing from this 3D Blu-ray player that we generally like to see in a player of this class. Onkyo omits aging connectivity options such as coaxial, component and composite ports. Furthermore, you won&#39;t find S-Video or SD Memory card connection options. This lack of connectivity is the primary reason  that this 3D Blu-ray player ranked so far down on our side-by-side comparison chart.","In every other area, the Onkyo BD-SP309 performs outstandingly. Like all the other products in this category, this 3D Blu-ray player displays video at 1080p resolution. Hollywood films are displayed at 24 frames per second, providing a theatric quality for movies viewed in 3D or 2D."]},"id":"36b969be-41fc-4489-96d2-c1491cc08d43","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"443f8454-389e-4062-98fb-0cd054af7278","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["At the end of the day, the lack of connection ports is what keeps the Onkyo BD-SP309 3D Blu-ray player from scoring higher on our review.
