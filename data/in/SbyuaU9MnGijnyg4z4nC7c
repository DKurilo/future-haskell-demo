Video Converter is an application that lives up to its name. It can convert pretty much any video you’ve got into any format you want, including converting DVDs for your iPad. It’s easy to use, performs conversions quickly and has tons of customization options.","In our review of the best <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/convert-dvds-to-digital-files,review-4813.html\">DVD to iPad converters</a>, this was the only product on our lineup to earn a perfect Ease of Use score. When you launch the application for the first time, it walks you through its features and tools. All the tools you need to convert your DVDs are located in the interface’s main window.","Once a DVD is loaded into the program, all you have to do is select the tracks you want to convert, pick the version of iPad you own and then click Convert Now. If you’re converting a feature-length Hollywood movie, expect to wait 1.5 hours for the application to complete the task.","Like other DVD converters we reviewed, Any Video Converter has a library of preprogrammed profiles that optimize your conversion for a wide range of devices. However, unlike most of the products on our lineup, this application has conversion profiles for every single model of the iPad. So even if you own the first or latest iPad, this program is able to tailor your DVD conversion to your specific iPad model.","In our tests, we compared the quality of the converted DVD movie to a digital download of the same film. For the purposes of our test, we selected the Normal quality option for our conversion. Using this setting, we noticed degradation in both the audio and video quality of the conversion. Things like scaling blur in the video and loss of volume and detail in the audio were the most conspicuous imperfections we noted. It’s nothing that makes the film unwatchable, but it&#39;s enough to be noticeable to a keen eye or ear. Selecting a higher quality option may correct these problems, but the conversion will take longer and yield a larger file.","Sometimes you don’t want to convert an entire movie, or you want to customize your conversion beyond the options offered in optimization profiles. This program has every customization option we look for in this category. You have the ability to trim away unwanted footage, crop footage, adjust picture values, add watermarks and more. Additionally, you can tweak technical aspects of your conversion, such as resolution, bit rate, and aspect ratio. These tools are great for those who have specific ideas about what they want out of their conversion.","Most of the products featured on our side-by-side comparison chart offer applications that work on both Windows and Mac. Any Video Converter is only available for Windows. So if you have a Mac, you’ll need to look elsewhere for a program to convert your DVDs for your iPad."]},"id":"813dc987-41f1-460f-ab7c-04c3858f3b13","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"789cf2b3-bd8c-42a8-8b4e-3317e3bfc35a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Any Video Converter is a solid choice for DVD to iPad conversions.
