If the power goes out, the battery backup means the system can still set off alarms if someone tries to break in. Scout's large and small starter kits on Amazon are a good way to get the starter devices you need for your system such as door panels, entry sensors and key fobs. One downside to Scout Alarm is that you must pay a monthly fee ($9.99) to use the system, but this fee pays for built-in cellular backup, which is often more expensive with other DIY home security systems. There's no contract so you can cancel service if you don't need it. You can also upgrade a Scout Alarm system to include professional monitoring ($19.99/month), so you can get extra protection when you're unable to monitor your home yourself. This system is the easiest to install as it walks you through every step of the setup process in the mobile app, taking about 10 minutes to install. Scout Alarm works with the smart home platforms from Amazon, Nest and IFTTT. When we tested Scout's siren, it wasn't as loud as other security alarms we tested, but it is loud enough that other sounds in your home shouldn’t drown it out. Scout's one-year warranty isn't very long compared to the three-year warranties from competitors, and the company doesn't sell any security cameras for the system.","<a href=\"/scout-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"e34a6685-2012-47b6-9ab7-391fe76c747e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Value"},"id":"370f8c1d-c049-4ff8-8d90-c372877f6b82","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/NCfPUAXQQWD3MbPdNwptzR.jpg","link":{"href":"/home/smart-home/best-diy-home-security/iris-review/","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/2/H/803609/original/DIY-Home-Security-Iris-BOM.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NCfPUAXQQWD3MbPdNwptzR.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"NCfPUAXQQWD3MbPdNwptzR","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NCfPUAXQQWD3MbPdNwptzR.jpg","alt":"Iris by Lowe's"},"id":"96c5cfe5-1ef7-43f5-bacb-6a13631e96e6","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Iris by Lowe's\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":85,"url":"/iris-review","name":"Iris by Lowe's Smart Hub + Security Pack","id":"1594"},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/iris-review\">Iris by Lowe's</a>","pros":["Most affordable professional monitoring","Comprehensive smart home compatibility","Comprehensive equipment selection"],"cons":["Cellular backup requires extra purchase","Some features require monthly fee","One-year warranty"]},"id":"462ef4ae-a8c1-4d27-a2c0-82d3adc1b14e","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Iris by Lowe's is the best value among DIY home security systems because it combines a capable system with the lowest prices we've seen.

This isn't a combined kit like other systems we tested, but Lowe's sometimes includes the Smart Hub as a bonus item at no cost. Even at full price, the Security Pack and Smart Hub are less expensive than the competition. Iris has three no-contract service plans: basic, premium and professional monitoring. The basic plan is free, gives you control over your system and sends alerts to your smartphone when the alarm goes off. The premium plan ($9.99/month) expands the basic plan controls and adds video storage. The professional monitoring plan ($14.95/month) adds cellular backup and links your home to a certified monitoring station that can send emergency responders to your home. This professional monitoring plan is the cheapest among the systems we tested, tied with SimpliSafe. For cellular backup, you need to buy a modem that plugs into the Smart Hub. The keypad in the Security Pack has a built-in siren, but it's one of the quietest we tested. This system is compatible with more smart home devices than the others we tested.

One of the best things about abode is you can buy the amount of professional monitoring you need on a monthly, weekly or even a three-day basis. This is particularly convenient when you can't monitor the system on your own during vacations. To install abode, you need to connect the base station to your router using an Ethernet cable and set up the sensors with the mobile app. It takes about 10 minutes to set up. When we tested the built-in siren, it was one of the loudest, making it hard for intruders to ignore. There's a 10-hour backup battery that keeps your system functional when the power goes out. Another thing that makes abode so easy to use is its ability to talk to devices from Nest and Amazon, as well as Z-Wave and ZigBee devices.

During this time, we&#39;ve honed our testing process to look at over 100 distinct factors to determine how well a system works. Each time we update our reviews, we also update our scores based on how customers currently perceive the products. We do this by extensively researching user reviews at retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy, Home Depot and Lowe&#39;s.","When we test, we borrow some of the DIY security systems from their manufacturers and buy others. Although we may reach out for technical support or for clarification on a particular feature, the companies have no input on our testing practices and we don’t share our results or rankings with them before publishing our reviews.","As we researched this topic and security systems in general, we reached out to Jamie Vos, vice president of the <a href=\"http://esaweb.org/About\">Electronic Security Association</a> (ESA) for his thoughts on DIY systems. He emphasized professional monitoring for security systems: “If you receive a text alert, you may not be in a condition to respond and you may not hear an alarm. At that point, you have lost valuable response time, whereas a professional monitoring station can automatically alert first responders.”","We also contacted Kirk MacDowell, a board member with the <a href=\"https://www.securityindustry.org/about-sia/\">Security Industry Association</a> (SIA) and president of MacGuard Security Advisors Inc. He said a security system can act as a central heartbeat in the home. “Devices such as locks that can be opened remotely, home light control and thermostats that can raise or lower temperature are all tied into one convenient app and then tied into the alarm, making the operation seamless.”","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","For each new DIY security system, we test in two areas: user experience and ease of installation. These help build a picture of a system&#39;s effectiveness and how it affects you.","For user experience tests, we see what each system and its companion smartphone app can do. In our experience, the best DIY home security systems have many ways to arm and disarm so you don&#39;t always need your smartphone. They also let you use a keypad or key fob to accomplish the same goal. We look at activity feeds and the organization of the mobile app to see what information an app gives you when an alarm goes off and if the alert gives you instant info. The top performers in this test were abode and Scout Alarm, with Nest Secure and SimpliSafe tying for third place.","During installation tests, we make sure the manual or mobile app can get you through the setup process without contacting the company. We also look at whether the equipment in each system&#39;s starter kit requires additional tools such as screwdrivers and batteries. Finally, we time how long it takes to set up each component. We found Scout Alarm, SimpliSafe and abode easier to set up than most other DIY security systems.","<strong>How Much do DIY Security Systems Cost?</strong>","There are three costs you can expect with most DIY security systems: equipment, access fees and professional security monitoring. You can expect to spend an average of $250 on equipment, though this goes up as you buy more sensors. Access fees are sometimes required to unlock all or part of a system&#39;s self-monitoring features for about $10 a month.","With regards to professional monitoring, you can expect to pay between $15 and $30 a month for the service, which generally covers any access fees as well. This is lower than the $37 average on traditional <a href=\"/best-home-security-systems\">security systems</a> and doesn&#39;t require a contract; not all DIY security systems have professional monitoring.","<strong>What Equipment Should You Get?</strong>","Begin with a starter kit that covers your basic DIY home security needs such as the number of motion detectors and entry sensors for your home&#39;s size. From there, you can choose other devices to enhance the surveillance around your home. Most of the systems we tested sell add-ons to boost your security beyond the basics.","The most useful add-ons are third-party smart home devices. Scout Alarm, abode, SimpliSafe, <a href=\"/swannone-review\">SwannOne</a>, <a href=\"/wink-lookout-review\">Wink</a> and Iris by Lowe&#39;s can all integrate with Nest, which means you can set up your home security system to work with other <a href=\"/nest-cam-review\">Nest products such as a security camera</a>.","Half of the systems we tested can also use <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a>, a free internet-based automation service that helps DIY security systems and third-party smart home devices work together.
