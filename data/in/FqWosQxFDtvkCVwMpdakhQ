If so, the Mountain Hardwear Hotbed Flame 20, with its cotton lining, may be a good choice for you. Active Junky tested sleeping bags on multiple camping trips in Utah and Colorado and found this synthetic sleeping bag a solid choice for moderate backpacking trips or car camping.","This synthetic sleeping bag is not as light as down-filled ones, weighing in at 3.5 pounds, but it’s still a good weight for moderate backpacking, and it packs reasonably small for taking on car camping trips. The Thermal Q Thermic MX insulation does well holding in warmth even when dealing with light rain or morning condensation. The shell itself is a 75D Polyester Taffeta to repel moisture as well.","This mummy sleeping bag uses a welded Lamina construction the manufacturer says enhances loft and removes cold spots. The backpack itself is roomy, and it offers extra length so that even taller people can use it comfortably. Some of the Active Junky testers measure 6’5” and still used the sleeping bag with ease.","The testers especially appreciated the cotton lining. They considered it akin to sleeping in your own sheets at home. In addition, the stuff sack is lined with microfleece and makes a comfortable pillow.  Like some sleeping bags, this one offers a double zipper design, so on warm nights, you can open it up to give your feet some air.","Despite its comfort and warmth, the size and weight make the Mountain Hardwear Hotbed Flame 20 a better choice for people who enjoy car camping or who are going on moderate hikes to their campsite. More serious backpackers may want to check into a lighter sleeping bag.","<strong>Tester Comment:</strong> More for car camping than backpacking, Hotbed’s comfort is superior, and this is an easy sleeping bag. For the money, a good call that escapes the clinginess of a typical nylon lining. <br/><strong>Key Feature: </strong>Comfort<br/><strong>Best For: </strong>Mellow-moderate backpacking trips and car camping excursions. <br/><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The cotton liner of this mummy sleeping back makes for a more comfortable sleep, while the synthetic filling and shell fight moisture and keep you warm. Overall, a good sleeping bag for moderate backpacking and car camping."]},"id":"51763d8b-8d7e-4547-8b5c-643b2c437bc3","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68157","url":"/mountain-hardwear-hotbed-flame-20-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"melanie-ott","url":"/author/melanie-ott","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Melanie Ott","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4FsdpZgejtFEkguRBUMhwb","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-02T18:57:02Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T18:57:02Z","name":"Mountain Hardwear Hotbed Flame 20","synopsis":"Do you hate it when the nylon interior of a sleeping bag gets clingy with static?
