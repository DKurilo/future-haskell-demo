This makes the value of the low price even more enticing.      <br />\n     <br />\nIn the audio performance test, the TT-BR05 received a B for signal clarity and a C+ for signal strength. The signal clarity is the more important grade, because you can compensate for signal strength by turning the volume up on your stereo, but you can't compensate for clarity. The signal strength was significantly lower than other AUX-in kits and FM transmitters, but this is also the only kit powered by a rechargeable battery – so it makes sense for the signal to be weaker than a kit using direct power. The weaker signal doesn't mean you can't reach dangerously high volumes. It just means the stereo needs to have the volume knob turned up higher to reach the same deafening volumes other kits start out with. Still, it's far superior, at least when streaming music, to the visor-style kits with built-in speakers.      <br />\n     <br />\nThis is the most unobtrusive Bluetooth car kit I've seen. It's small and doesn't draw attention to itself with flashy lights and displays. It's almost completely cordless, only requiring a cord for charging the battery, and doesn't rely on an adhesive backing to stick to the dash.

AUX-in kits are usually the cheapest and cost between $10 and $30 with the best AUX-in kits priced at $20. However, make sure your stereo has an auxiliary input before you purchase one, otherwise, it&#39;s useless. The cheapest FM transmitters cost as low as $12 and as high as $50. That said, the cheapest transmitters aren&#39;t worth it. The FM transmission quality is just not strong enough for stereos to receive a clear signal. The visor-style kits are the most expensive, costing between $50 and $120.","Amazon Echo Auto: The Next Evolution in Bluetooth Car Kits?","The Bluetooth car kit industry is built on filling technology gaps - giving drivers the benefits of Bluetooth in vehicles without Bluetooth. For example, when I first started reviewing this category four years ago, visor-style Bluetooth car kits like the Jabra Freeway and Jabra Tour dominated the market. This was because hands-free calling devices was very popular, especially as some states made it illegal to drive and talk on the phone without one.","However, as music streaming apps grew in popularity, so did the gap between drivers looking for Bluetooth kits aimed at streaming audio through their speakers. As a result, only a few visor-style kits still exist. But as Bluetooth has been a standard feature on even the most affordable car stereos for many years now, even these Bluetooth car kits are starting to be squeezed out as the technology gap closes. But as one gap closes, another usually opens. This is why the Amazon Echo Auto is an interesting new addition to the market.","The Echo Auto features eight microphones and far-field technology, allowing it to hear you through all the noise - air conditioning, road noise, music. While you can stream music and audiobooks, just like with other Bluetooth car kits, because it has Alexa, it also integrates with other smart home devices. You can ask Alexa to adjust your home’s thermostat on your way home from work. This is what makes the Echo Auto so appealing and why it might present the next gap for Bluetooth car kits to fill - smart home device integration.","Announced in September 2018, it hasn’t been available for purchase until now. But even now, it’s only available by invitation. You have to submit a request to Amazon and be accepted to have the opportunity to purchase it, which suggests it’s still in the development phase and the final product is still forthcoming.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","In past reviews, I emphasized the hands-free call quality of Bluetooth car kits over the audio streaming performance. I performed comprehensive evaluations of both sides of a call while driving through freeways, city streets and heavy traffic. This approach was largely a legacy of a market once crowded with visor-style Bluetooth car kits made for hands-free calling. And it was a mistake. Hands-free calling is not safe (explained in the next section).","Rather than focusing on call quality, I&#39;ve turned the focus of my tests to how well these devices bridge the gap between old and new technology. Most people, as evidenced on Amazon, are buying simple Bluetooth adapters with a simple purpose – to stream audio from a phone through a stereo. As such, my tests focused on audio performance."]},"id":"fa79af36-bdb8-4629-8369-bf1f910824de","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/6pUC4RAiDBkokswHpTzyS6.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"There are two parts to audio performance – signal clarity and signal strength.

The A grades were around 3 dB louder on average than the B grades and 6 dB louder than C grades. The visor-style kits were predictably much worse, at about 17 dB quieter, because they don&#39;t rely on the stereo to amplify the signal but rely on small built-in speakers.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/car-kit-adapter-best-bluetooth-car-adapter/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9GLzkvNzc0MjYxL29yaWdpbmFsL0JsdWV0b290aC1DYXItS2l0cy1UZXN0aW5nLTAwNi5qcGc=","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JnkxJXpn22hYFmhTLRVH3X.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"JnkxJXpn22hYFmhTLRVH3X","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JnkxJXpn22hYFmhTLRVH3X.jpg","alt":""},"id":"f9d7d658-56ed-428c-b361-0b57f0f64c77","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Functionality<br/>If you&#39;re trying to bridge the gap between an old stereo and the desire to stream your favorite Pandora stations, then you want a simple, functional Bluetooth adapter that&#39;s quick to pair, easy to use and doesn&#39;t get in the way.

Even with a good antenna, the noise in the signal is very noticeable.

This is an average of 9.45 fatalities a day. While it&#39;s easy to assume these distractions were texting drivers (because it&#39;s the primary example used in driving awareness campaigns), talking on the phone also falls under the NHTSA&#39;s definition of distracted driving, regardless of hands-free devices. There&#39;s good reason for this.","A <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/broadcast/read/35831\">study</a> published by Graham Hole, a professor at the University of Sussex, had drivers answer various questions via a phone call while navigating a course. The drivers performed the test both hands-free (using a Bluetooth hands-free device) and hands-full (phone in hand). Similar tests were performed on the show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLVUR9Lesa4\">Mythbusters</a>. Both came to the same conclusion – there is no difference between hands-free calling and hands-full driving. Both result in distracted driving. The reason, as Hole explains, is &#34;conversations are more visual than we might expect, leading drivers to ignore parts of the outside world in favor of their inner &#39;visual world.&#39;&#34; In fact, the activity of the visual cortex in the brain, which processes moving images, decreases by a third when a driver is listening to a caller."]},"id":"a1b26f13-8a2f-4685-a3b1-e978f49caa87","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/Q5W8Y6g3vyaXKUv8izc2F5.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"To put it simply, if you need to make a phone call, pull off the road and park before you talk.
