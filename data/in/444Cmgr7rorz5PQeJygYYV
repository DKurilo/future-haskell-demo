It’s also the only product we considered that comes with multipurpose grooming tools such as a daily cleansing brush, a deep scrubbing brush and a pre-shave prep brush. These attachments are masculine versions of products you’ll find on our <a href=\"/best-facial-cleansing-brushes\">best facial cleansing brushes</a> site. The Verso 5 also has a precision trimmer.","We included three rotary shavers among our most recent top 10 electric razors – the Verso 5, the <a href=\"/philips-norelco-7500-review\">Philips Norelco 7500</a> and the <a href=\"/remington-hyperflex-review\">Remington HyperFlex XR1470</a>. Of the three, the Philips Norelco was our favorite. The Verso 5 scored lowest in our rankings among both rotary and foil shavers because of its disappointing shaving performance and its subpar rechargeable battery. Our testers said it pulled longer facial hair and didn’t provide a consistently smooth shave.","“It was pretty good in some places, but bad in others,” one tester said. “The inconsistency made [your face] look worse, as though you tried to shave but missed some spots because you weren’t paying attention.”","Also, the Verso 5 has the least impressive battery we examined. A full recharge takes four hours for just 45 minutes of use time. By contrast, the battery of our top pick, the <a href=\"/wahl-shaver-review\">Wahl LifeProof 7061-100</a>, provides 90 minutes of use time on a 90-minute charge. With an MSRP of just $69.99, the Wahl also costs $30 less than the Verso 5.","While it requires some getting used to, the Verso 5’s handle is comfortable, and it has a textured, non-slip grip. Our testers said the shaver worked best on their cheeks and was harder to maneuver at the jawline, especially moving up toward their ears.","Like all the best electric razors, this shaver is waterproof and can be safely used in the shower. You can also shave with foam, but gel seems to clog the blades. Fortunately, this shaver is easy to clean. You simply remove the shaving head, blow out loose hairs and rinse it under running water.","The Verso 5 comes with a travel/storage pouch and has worldwide voltage adaptation. Remington warranties this shaver for two years and provides customer service by phone and email. If our rankings were based solely on consumer support, Remington products would earn our best scores."]},"id":"0e4560c0-b30a-45b9-929c-e0a02d1af09f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70230","url":"/remington-hyperflex-verso-5-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-11T18:41:41Z","datePublished":"2018-09-11T18:41:41Z","name":"Remington HyperFlex Verso 5 (XR1410)","synopsis":"The Remington HyperFlex Verso 5 (XR1410) is the only electric razor we tested with a palm-held design.","review":{"rating":80,"verdict":"The Remington HyperFlex Verso 5 (XR1410) has a unique design with multipurpose functionality.
