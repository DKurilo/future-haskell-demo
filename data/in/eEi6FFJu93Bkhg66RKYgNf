They strive to make their software easy to use and functional, providing both the essential conversion features as well as less-common editing capabilities. Their commitment to quality software is evident in the care they provide for their products; their customer support is one of the more impressive parts of 4Videosoft’s DVD to iPad converter, along with their video quality and astounding conversion speeds. This was one of only two products to outperform our top products in conversion speed. However, lower scores in the features category and a cluttered user interface brought it down in the rankings. With some improvements in these areas, 4Videosoft could do very well in this comparison.
