The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-photo-slideshow-software\"><em>Photo Slideshow Software</em></a><em> here.</em>","Photo MovieTheater will help you create basic photo slideshows in little time. This slideshow software is designed to help you share the photos you love most with your friends and family. It has an adequate selection of features and tools to help you edit and design your presentations, but it lacks many advanced features that would greatly enhance this application and raise its ranking on our lineup.","The design elements this slideshow software offers are simple, but they do an excellent job of helping you create appealing and attractive slideshows. There are 29 transition effects to choose from to add to your shows, and there is no limit on the number of images you can include. There are several background colors you can choose from, but we could not find any themed or pre-designed templates to include in our slideshow, which is a drawback.","When you import your photos into the photo slideshow maker, you must add them one at a time. Once your photos are uploaded and ready to go, you can easily drag and drop audio files and effects to add them to your show. You can also add text captions, voice recordings, video clips and clip art. However, we are disappointed that you can&#39;t control the timing of each slide.","Photo MovieTheater is one of the best slideshow software options for input and output offerings. There is a wide variety of input formats this software is compatible with, including JPG, JPEG, TIF, TIFF, AVI, MPEG, MOV and more. When it comes to output options, this slideshow creator supports more than 40 file formats. A few of these formats include AVI, WMV, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 and MOV. You can also create Blu-ray discs, DVDs and CDs of your slideshows. If you want to, you can upload your slideshows to your mobile device and watch them while you&#39;re on the go.","This photo slideshow program is fairly easy to use. The drag-and-drop functionality makes it simple to import your images and audio. However, Photo MovieTheater doesn&#39;t receive the highest ease-of-use score because we had a difficult time learning how to preview our slideshow. We had to ask customer service and wait for a response. Once we figured out how to preview the slideshow, the preview was choppy and difficult to watch.","When it comes to customer support, Photo MovieTheater has several resources. There are FAQs and several video and picture tutorials available on this photo slideshow&#39;s website to help you along your way. You can also watch the demos that are featured on the website for additional assistance. If you want to speak directly with a support representative, email support is available. However, telephone and live chat are not available."]},"id":"61275ec8-90c6-4c3a-86cd-b493bc9f79c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d1e195dd-7382-44cc-beb8-58ed20e6762e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Photo MovieTheater is an excellent choice for picture slideshow software, particularly if you need a multitude of input and output options.
