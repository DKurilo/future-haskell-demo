If you jumped into a police vehicle, it was either imaginary or self-propelled, which made the experience a little less memorable. Children today have the luxury of enjoying high-tech products like the Patrol H. Police bike from National Products. This vehicle looks like a real police bike, complete with lights and Police stickers. How much more official could they look?","The bike is equipped with two forward speeds, 2.5-MPH and 5-MPH, in addition to a single reverse speed of 2.5-MPH. It is quite like the real deal, with a hand accelerator in addition to sound effect, a headlight, hazard lights, tail lights and rear storage. The siren sound effect is designed to sound different from a real police siren, so you won&#39;t have to worry about confusing the two. If you are looking for a motorcycle that doesn&#39;t go as fast, our top pick for toddlers, the <a href=\"/best-ride-on-toys\">Harley Rocker Motorcycle</a> only accelerates to 2 mph.","Now your child can re-live the old cops and robbers game with the real deal. Chase down those robbers in style with this bike, and your child can cuff the perpetrator with confidence. If your neighborhood deals with children zipping around on their own electric vehicles, then this <a href=\"/best-ride-on-toys\">ride-on toy</a> vehicle will be the ideal solution to give them speeding tickets.","While the vehicle is capable of two different speeds, this particular model seems to have problems with the high-speed setting. In addition, while the battery is supposed to give upwards of three hours of use for the bike, it isn&#39;t uncommon for the battery life to deteriorate after a few months of use. The Kid Motorz Patrol H. Police bike comes with a simple 90-day warranty, so try to get the most use during that period to identify any potential issues with the bike.","The bike requires some assembly before use in addition to charging the battery. The battery must be charged for a total of 18 hours prior to the first use. Assembly of the vehicle includes the basics such as applying stickers to the body, though you can have everything in place within 30 minutes.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"d7c4d871-d2f5-41d0-9c19-516fab61a49a","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_55392","url":"/kid-motorz-patrol-h-police-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-11-15T17:17:07Z","datePublished":"2012-11-15T17:17:07Z","name":"Kid Motorz Patrol H.
