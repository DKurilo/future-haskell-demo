The <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/56811-educational-toys-for-elementary-students.html\">ant habitats</a> available from this company are not designed as a box that you fill with gel or sand; instead, it is an ant hill, which gives more of the illusion that your ants are in their natural habitat.","The ant habitat design is in a dome shape and two-sided views of the habitat allow you to easily see the tunnels the ants are building. With these products, once you place ants in the ant farm, you cannot move the farm or you will disrupt the ants building tunnels.","These products require much more interaction and learning value to help keep the ants alive. The inside of the ant farms is filled with sand so you must feed and water the ants regularly to keep them alive.","When you order an ant farm from Insect Lore, you will receive a certificate to redeem 25 harvester ants. However, you must pay the shipping of your ants, but they are guaranteed to be arrived alive. Additionally, if the weather is not ideal for shipping the ants, shipping will be delayed. This includes temperatures below 32 degrees Fahrenheit or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit.","Insect Lore highly discourages finding ants on your own and placing in their ant farms as smaller ants may escape from the ant farm. The Ant Hill design of these ant farms are specifically designed for harvester ants, and you will want to ensure that those are the only ants placed inside. The ant farms are built with an escape-proof locking lid that is designed for Harvester ants.","It is estimated the ants will live about two to four weeks in these ant farms with regular care. One of the benefits of these products is that you can add fresh sand to the ant habitat and start again after the ants have passed away. You can order refill kits on the Insect Lore website.","These products come with an instructions and activity book to help you get the most of your ant farm, and you can also learn more about ants on a FAQs section on the company website. If you have any other questions or concerns, you can contact the company via email and telephone."]},"id":"2823faf0-9243-44c2-9fe0-b473e0e19b36","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_68168","url":"/insect-lore-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-08-02T19:31:40Z","datePublished":"2016-08-02T19:31:40Z","name":"Insect Lore","synopsis":"Insect Lore provides an ant hill a unique twist.
