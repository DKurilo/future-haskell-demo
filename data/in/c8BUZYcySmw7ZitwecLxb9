However, the Kenwood DNX6960 does not have a motorized face panel and, therefore, has to sacrifice some of its screen size to accommodate the DVD/CD slot and some controls on the front of the unit."]},"id":"00f8d51f-db44-4b0b-b7c1-7bfa7b35c361","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Navigation &amp; Connectivity"},"id":"4d2353ac-03c5-4db4-b74e-8d1101580a93","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Kenwood DNX6960 in-dash navigation unit features a built-in Garmin GPS which uses a NAVTEQ map database. This database provides over 6 million points of interest (POIs). These POIs are pre-programmed locations in your GPS that enable you to find popular restaurants, hotels, gas stations and more, simply by typing in the name of the place you are looking for.","This in-dash navigation unit is also NAVTEQ Traffic ready. It doesn&#39;t have built-in traffic updates, but when you attach the KNA-NT100 traffic receiver (sold separately), you&#39;ll see live updates on how to avoid construction, accidents and other road blocks on your trip. This can help ensure you&#39;ll get to where you need to be as quickly as possible.","The touchscreen monitor is only 6.1 inches, which is one of the smallest screens we found in our in-dash navigation review; however six inches is still plenty of space to see the 2D or 3D maps clearly and use the controls without too many problems. You can also change the onscreen language and the voice prompt languages to better personalize the GPS to your needs.","Eco Route is a handy feature on the Kenwood DNX6960 in-dash navigation system because it can help you save money and the environment. When enabled, this function will guide you through the most fuel-efficient routes and can monitor your fuel usage and your CO2 output. Using this tool will help you drive more efficiently and reduce your carbon footprint."]},"id":"c4aeb632-770f-4d16-907b-1f80fa9bbb23","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Features"},"id":"a6677d4c-3f00-410e-8ff2-a0c2804d8734","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This double DIN receiver will take up a little more space in your dashboard than the traditional car stereo head unit, but it is well worth it. In addition to all the navigational features of the Kenwood DNX6960, there are a slew of multimedia options to keep you entertained. This Kenwood receiver is much more than a GPS.","The built-in Bluetooth enables you to make and accept calls without having to fumble around with your cell phone. It also lets you sync up your in-dash navigational receiver with any Bluetooth-enabled device. This means you can also play music from your iPod or other MP3 player on your car stereo without any physical connection.","The DNX6960 also features a built-in AM/FM tuner, and it is ready for satellite radio and HD Radio. If you want to listen to SIRIUS radio you&#39;ll need the CA-SR20V cable and the SIRIUS tuner, if you want to listen to XM Satellite Radio then you&#39;ll need the KCA-XM100V adapter and XM Mini Tuner, and if you want to listen to HD Radio then that requires the KTC-HR300 adapter. It is disappointing that these features are not built into the in-dash navigation receiver, but at least it is ready for this kind of technology.","Unlike some other models, this in-dash navigation system does not have a motorized front panel which hides the DVD/CD port. Instead, the DVD/CD slot is just above the monitor. The Kenwood DNX6960 can play DVDs and CDs, as well as DVD-R/RW and CD-R/RW formats. It also can play MP3s, WMAs, AACs, WAVs and more. If you&#39;re no longer using DVDs and CDs, you can also plug your preferred media player into the auxiliary input or use the USB port. This variety of multimedia options allows you to be entertained, no matter what format you are using.","If you have a camera on the rear of your vehicle, you can connect it to the DNX6960 in-dash navigation unit and have the video appear right on your dashboard. This can help prevent injury or accident when you&#39;re backing up. This system also comes with a remote control, so those in the back seat can control their movie watching while you continue to focus on the road."]},"id":"71f9770c-6102-4a7f-af6c-3d58efe27f18","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"a2e55f91-5fd8-49b4-9c07-4f1b93911cd2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The FAQs page was a little disappointing.
