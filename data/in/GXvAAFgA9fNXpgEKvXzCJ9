You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","While you&#39;re looking for a new <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">high definition camcorder</a>, video quality should be the first quality to look at. Most of these HD camcorders will record content in full 1080p HD, so other factors such as optical and digital zoom, ability to record in low light, design, and extra features should be taken into consideration. The Samsung QF20BN performs well because of its lightweight and sleek design, but it lacks some features that we became accustomed to in the other camcorders we reviewed.","The Samsung QF20BN has a 20x optical zoom, which is exactly average for the category. An optical zoom is nice, because the lens actually moves forward, getting closer to the image and preserving the resolution. This is opposed to a digital zoom which crops and zooms in on the center of an image. Too much digital zoom degrades the image quality. This HD camcorder only has a 40x digital zoom. Even if you max out the digital zoom, the image quality should be pretty close to HD, but not having the option to zoom in even further is annoying.","The lux rating on this HD video recorder is 3, comparatively high. If this HD video recorder had a lower lux rating it would perform better in low light situations. In good lighting situations though, it does record much better.","One of the best things about this high definition video camera is that it is small and very lightweight at only 6 ounces. The Samsung QF20BN is the lightest camcorder that we reviewed. This makes it compact enough to store and carry around with you. This is beneficial if you don&#39;t like carrying around a big, heavy camcorder on your trips to Disney World, the zoo or your kid&#39;s soccer game. Because it&#39;s so lightweight, the camcorder is sometimes hard to keep steady while you record, but this is a small price to pay for the added convenience. This camcorder also has built-in Wi-Fi so you can share your photos and videos instantly.","Getting support from Samsung shouldn&#39;t be too big of a problem. Samsung offers a variety of ways to get in touch with them if you have problems or questions about your HD camcorder. For quick assistance you can hit them up over live chat or phone support. You can also email them, or look up answers through their FAQs section or user forums. Samsung also has a standard one-year labor warranty and a 90-day guarantee on parts."]},"id":"4e32b380-c535-4aed-8cee-6595143691dc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a038062a-3fdf-4e83-8f80-e41a46fb40b6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Samsung QF20BN is a nice HD camcorder if you&#39;re looking for something very portable.
