Traditional tower computers tend to be bulky and take up a lot of room. <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-pc,review-2159.html\">All-in-one computers</a>, on the other hand, are virtually wire-free and take up a fraction of the space because all the parts are neatly tucked away inside its big monitor.","The Acer Aspire AZ3-605-UR23 is a 23-inch all-in-one desktop with a 1920x1080 display resolution that makes watching movies an enjoyable experience. This home PC comes with a DVD burner and allows you to listen to your CDs. However, if you&#39;re a big movie buff and have a huge collection of Blu-rays, then the lack of a Blu-ray drive might pose a problem.","With the 10-point touch functionality, you can swipe, pinch, slide your hands across the screen and navigate with ease. The ability to use two hands at once makes the process fast and allows you to share the touchscreen with another person simultaneously.","A big plus of this all-in-one desktop PC is that it comes with an HDMI-in port. With the HDMI, you can connect a newer game console and play games right on the PC with your friends and family.","The 1TB hard drive space of this home PC can accommodate movie lovers and music fanatics collection with enormous collections of media and still have room to spare.","One downside of this PC is that it only has two USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0 ports, which limits how many external devices you can connect to your PC at once. Uploading data will also be slower because it lacks a Thunderbolt port.","This all-in-one desktop does include a wireless keyboard and mouse, which adds to the sleek, wire free design.  And at roughly 20 pounds, it can be moved, with some strength, to a different location if conserving space is a prime issue.","For help and support, Acer provides channels to reach them by phone or email. However, there is also a live chat option you can take advantage of if you have an issue that&#39;s pressing."]},"id":"5f1dfb3b-64a6-4db0-b4fe-5607c27bf084","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"a13eb209-ec28-41e9-aa0f-cc80f6cd8244","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Acer Aspire AZ3-605-UR23 is a good all-in-one PC for watching movies because it comes with an HDMI-in port and has a display resolution of 1920 x 1080.
