Some programs, like F-Secure SAFE, come with a minimum of three licenses to protect multiple computers or laptops at once. There are a few free programs available, but they generally don’t recognize as many threats – plus they bog down your computer and have lots of annoying pop-up ads. If you want more protection with parental controls, a personal firewall or a password manager, check out Mac internet security suites that typically come with these extra tools for around $50.","<strong>Which antivirus is best for Mac?</strong>","<a href=\"/bitdefender-antivirus-for-mac-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac</a>, <a href=\"/trend-micro-review\">Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac</a> and <a href=\"/kaspersky-antivirus-for-mac-review\">Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac</a> are all great Mac antivirus programs that proved in our lab tests they are excellent at detecting, blocking and protecting against malware, including Trojans and ransomware. Because the most important function of antivirus for Mac is protecting against malware, Top Ten Reviews invests considerable time testing each program using live threats, so we can tell you exactly how the program works and how well it detects and blocks malware.","Windows threats don’t affect Mac devices, but we still test how well Mac antivirus tools detect these threats because they can hide among your files and accidentally be sent on to a PC through email or file sharing. <a href=\"/avast-review\">Avast Security for Mac</a>, AVG AntiVirus for Mac and Trend Micro all do an excellent job of detecting both Mac and Windows malware on Mac computers.","After protection, the biggest differences among Mac antivirus solutions are security features. Detection features are where and what the antivirus program scans on your computer. All of the leading programs scan USB drives and incoming email. Some Mac antivirus software includes a system vulnerability scan that looks for weak points in your computer, typically out-of-date software, and prompts you to install the latest version to strengthen those points. Programs such as Bitdefender present you with a legitimate link where you can download newer software rather than chance downloading a malicious link.","Extra security tools include parental controls that let you set up time limits or block family members from accessing dangerous websites. Password managers shield your username and password from key loggers as you log into email, bank accounts and social media pages. And safe banking tools protect you from identity thieves as you bank and shop online. These aren’t typically included with basic antivirus programs but are included with <a href=\"/best-mac-internet-security-software\">Mac internet security</a> suites.","Mobile protection isn’t included with antivirus programs, but a few solutions, such as <a href=\"/intego-virusbarrier-review\">Intego</a> and <a href=\"/eset-cybersecurity-for-mac-review\">ESET</a>, will scan your mobile phone or table for any threats and remove them if the device is connected to your computer through a USB port.","<strong>How do I remove viruses from my Mac?</strong>","The hardest part of cleaning a threat from a Mac computer is finding what the malware is called and where it is hiding, especially since there are sophisticated viruses that look and function like a legitimate app. There are sites that list common Mac malware and where they can be found using the Activity Monitor on your iOS. Once the threat is located, the next step is to stop the malicious application from running and quickly move it to the trash bin. This will keep the program from restarting. If there are any other folders or files that were installed along with the malicious application, make sure these are placed in the trash too; otherwise these files will continue to drain your computer’s resources and cause frustration. When you empty the trash bin these files will be permanently removed.","An easier way to ensure you quickly find and remove Mac viruses is to use an antivirus program like <a href=\"/bitdefender-antivirus-for-mac-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac</a> because it not only locates malicious apps and files, but automatically scrubs them from your computer for you. On top of that, because Mac antivirus programs are paid for through a yearly subscription, you can keep the program installed and use it to prevent a malware attack in the future.","<strong>What is the best antivirus software for Windows?</strong>","While <a href=\"/bitdefender-antivirus-for-mac-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac</a> is the best solution for Mac computers, <a href=\"/bitdefender-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2019</a> is the best for Windows machines. We discovered this after thousands of hours testing several antivirus solutions with over 500 live malware samples. On top of great malware protection, Bitdefender is also a good value because it includes extra security tools, like safe banking, a VPN and a password manager, along with its basic antivirus solution. Most competing software requires you to purchase a higher-priced internet security suite to get some of these same perks. The biggest drawback we noticed is that Bitdefender takes several steps to install and extra time to scan your computer for threats compared to other Windows antivirus solutions.","For a solution that doesn’t have a lot of extra tools and simply blocks malware from infecting your computer, we recommend <a href=\"/vipre-antivirus-antispyware-review\">VIPRE Advanced Security</a>. This antivirus software is a very light program that is really easy to install and use, plus it doesn’t zap your computer’s resources and cause slowdown."]},"id":"5916c47e-960d-4d26-9fcd-fab593b871f4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"333c96d3-724d-4c5e-9802-fc31480611cd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/bitdefender-antivirus-for-mac-review\">Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac</a>","<a href=\"/avast-review\">Avast Security for Mac Essential</a>","<a href=\"/norton-antivirus-for-mac-review\">Norton Security Standard</a>","<a href=\"/kaspersky-antivirus-for-mac-review\">Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac</a>","<a href=\"/f-secure-anti-virus-for-mac-review\">F-Secure SAFE</a>","<a href=\"/trend-micro-review\">Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac</a>","<a href=\"/avg-review\">AVG AntiVirus for Mac</a>","<a href=\"/webroot-review\">Webroot</a>","<a href=\"/intego-virusbarrier-review\">Intego Mac Internet Security X9</a>","<a href=\"/sophos-review\">Sophos Home for Mac</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"3ec6c90a-9210-487f-9dfa-3df61f9f5e80","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_352","url":"/best-mac-antivirus-software","authors":[{"email":"nicole.johnston@futurenet.com","slug":"nicole-johnston","url":"/author/nicole-johnston","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Nicole Johnston","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"nR6fcTbvfudgncYJbhzqDB","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-11T21:26:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-11T21:26:00Z","name":"Best Mac Antivirus Software of 2019","synopsis":"We ranked Mac antivirus programs from best to worst based on their AV-Test scores, system performance, scanning tools and support.
