You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Whirlpool WFC310S0 is a standard 4.8-cubic-foot <a href=\"/best-electric-cooktop-ranges\">electric range</a> that comes in three colors: white, black and stainless steel. This range is a good option for homeowners who do not spend hours in the kitchen baking and cooking every day. While this Whirlpool range is not as full featured as the best electric stoves, it is a reliable, affordable option for people who cook an occasional meal.","One of the best features of this cooking range is its ability to hold consistent baking temperatures, due largely in part to the AccuBake temperature management system. This system uses sensors to measure the current temperature of the oven and adjust the heat to make sure your food receives an even amount of heat at the correct temperature.","This electric stove has a keep-warm function that allows you to keep a dish warm while you cook other food on the range or just have to wait until mealtime comes around. You can also set a delayed time for the oven to heat up and cook your meal. This is a great feature for people who work long or odd hours and can&#39;t get home to stick a meal in the oven.","This range has four coil-style heating elements, two 6–inch and two 8-inch. The wattage tops out at 1,500 watts for the 6-inch burners and 2,600 for the 8-inch. The higher the wattage of a burner, the quicker it can heat up. The burners on the Whirlpool WFC310S0 take longer to heat up compared to our highest-ranked electric ranges, but provide steady heat.","The 4.8 cubic feet of oven space is large enough to hold an average-sized turkey, which is perfect if you are single or have a smaller family, but if you cook for a large household, you may want to consider getting a larger-capacity range so you can cook more food at once.","The storage drawer is lightweight and supported by plastic rollers, which have a tendency to misalign. This can be problematic if your pots and pans are heavy duty. This cooking range comes with two removable racks that you can adjust to five different levels. This helps you make the perfect birthday cake, broil meats evenly and fit your juicy Thanksgiving turkey or holiday ham in at the right height."]},"id":"98774ff7-67c4-4039-812d-aa918b30a850","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"43c71be6-fbc4-40a2-b6c7-c3702ac14862","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If all you need is a no-frills cooking range or you don&#39;t spend much time in the kitchen, then the Whirlpool WFC310S0 is a good choice as your next stove.
