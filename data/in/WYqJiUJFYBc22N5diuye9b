The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The Frigidaire Afinity FAFW3801LW front-load washer isn’t extravagant, but includes enough to get the basic laundry job done. You get five wash cycles and four options to choose from, and you have a choice of three soil levels, and five wash and rinse temperatures for each load of laundry.","It has a 3.26-cubic-foot washtub, which isn’t as large as many front-loading machines and is the smallest on our front-load washer review. However, you can still put a significant amount of laundry into one single load at a time, helping you remain more energy conscious with the laundry you do.","This front-loading washer does fall quite short in the features it offers, but we were impressed by the vibration control system and its fresh water rinse option.","The vibration control system helps to keep large, bulky loads of laundry balanced so your washer stays quiet and smooth while it’s running. Additionally, it has been deemed ideal for use on the second floor of a home.","The fresh water rinse option can be selected along with the wash cycle to make sure that towards the end of the cycle fresh water is used to rinse the load one more time to ensure no detergents or other additives are left on the laundry.","We are disappointed to see this front-load washing machine only available in the standard white color, but there are other models in the Frigidaire Afinity line that are available in additional colors. This Frigidaire Afinity front-load washer is 36 inches in height, is 27 inches wide and is 29-3/4 inches deep.","Frigidaire provides an impressive warranty for this front-load washer. For the first year, the parts and any labor you may need will be covered. Additionally, for 10 years, the motor is backed by the warranty the stainless steel washtub is covered for the functional lifetime of the product.","You can contact Frigidaire by phone for help and support or fill out an online contact form on their website for them to contact you via email for help and support. Frigidaire also has the user manual and some FAQs on its website, which are helpful."]},"id":"b4a0125f-7f77-490d-9a27-782e24dd9444","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"16715f50-8243-4006-8224-54c299a03481","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Frigidaire Afinity FAFW3801LW front-loader washer is basic and doesn’t give you many advanced or attractive features, but it will get the job of simple household laundry done with the five wash cycles and four options it does offer."]},"id":"dd249307-d284-49f1-a3bc-97bffc64cef1","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58382","url":"/frigidaire-afinity-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-09T22:01:55Z","datePublished":"2013-12-09T22:01:55Z","name":"Frigidaire Afinity FAFW3801LW","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","review":{"rating":61,"verdict":"The Frigidaire Afinity FAFW3801LW front-load washer is sufficient for basic household laundry.","pros":["You can select an additional rinse using fresh water at the end of the wash cycle."],"cons":["You only get five different wash cycles with this front-load washing machine."]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks as a top 10 product.","language":"en","dateModified":"2013-12-09T22:01:55Z","id":"WYqJiUJFYBc22N5diuye9b","meta":{"title":"Frigidaire Afinity FAFW3801LW Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Frigidaire Afinity FAFW3801LW front-load washer isn&#8217;t extravagant, but includes enough to get the basic laundry job done."},"products":[{"slug":"frigidaire-afinity-fafw3801lw","url":"/product/frigidaire-afinity-fafw3801lw","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:47:50Z","name":"Frigidaire Afinity FAFW3801LW","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:47:50Z","id":"WZ3wxorZmMH3U9TCZcAj4T","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T23:47:51Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/6L8vThLdh2JsV2nsU8ueU7.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:47:50Z","mimeType":"","name":"58354-frigidaire-afinity-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/58354-frigidaire-afinity-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:47:50Z","id":"6L8vThLdh2JsV2nsU8ueU7","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6L8vThLdh2JsV2nsU8ueU7.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Frigidaire Afinity FAFW3801LW Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Frigidaire Afinity FAFW3801LW front-load washer isn&#8217;t extravagant, but includes enough to get the basic laundry job done."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/6L8vThLdh2JsV2nsU8ueU7.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:47:50Z","mimeType":"","name":"58354-frigidaire-afinity-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/58354-frigidaire-afinity-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:47:50Z","id":"6L8vThLdh2JsV2nsU8ueU7","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6L8vThLdh2JsV2nsU8ueU7.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Frigidaire Afinity FAFW3801LW Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The Frigidaire Afinity FAFW3801LW front-load washer isn&#8217;t extravagant, but includes enough to get the basic laundry job done."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/home/laundry/best-front-load-washers/frigidaire-afinity-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:47:50Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:47:50Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"laundry","url":"/home-and-garden/laundry","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T23:47:50Z","name":"Laundry","dateModified":"2019-04-17T23:47:50Z","id":"CP3bUaVaeESJdSe8Vaof4H","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
