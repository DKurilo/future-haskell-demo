The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about <a href=\"/best-beat-making-software\">Beat Making Software</a> here.</em>","Sequel 3 beat software has drag-and-drop functionality and a large loop library to make your own beats. Sequel 3 has many of the tools and features that you should look for in beat making software, but its unfavorable interface can make things difficult, especially if you are new to the program.","Sequel 3 has a single screen layout where all of your essential recording tools are within the same area. Across the top section of the interface is the arrangement window, where you record and arrange your music, and the browser window, which is where all of the program&#39;s audio information is stored. The entire bottom section of the interface is interchangeable depending on whether you have the mixer, track inspector or performance sequencer open.","There are over 5,000 available loops and sounds within the interface. To add loops to your composition, you simply drag and drop them to the arrangement window. Making adjustments to the audio within the arrangement window is when the music maker software starts to show its functionality drawbacks. For instance, if you want to insert an effect to the track, you need to highlight the track, which will then pull up the track inspector window in the bottom half of the interface. From here you go through a lengthy process dealing with effect options and menus.  Other programs allow you to insert effects through the mixer with a click of a button.","The mixer is bare and presents little track information. The mixer is generally used to EQ each track and adjust volume levels, but you can&#39;t access the equalizer through the mixer. The equalizer is in the track inspector, which is an odd location. The equalizer is a simple 3-band equalizer where you can adjust the low, mid and high frequencies for each audio track. The basic mixer doesn&#39;t let you go in-depth with your audio adjustments, but it is simple to use.","Sequel 3 boasts three virtual instruments that can make an array of sounds. The HALion Sonic SE is perhaps the most versatile of all the virtual instruments. HALion Sonic SE is a synthesizer that produces many sounds from accordions to drums.","The VST Amp Simulator is a great tool to emulate multiple amp tones and styles. You can plug your guitar straight into your interface and have great guitar tone by loading any of the amp presets. The presets include guitar tones from Fender to Marshall guitar amps. The Amp Simulator is a highlight for this beat making software, and is also included with <a href=\"/cubase-elements-review\">Cubase Elements</a>.","This beat creation software also has live performance capabilities. You can record sections of your arrangement window and assign to specific pads in the performance window. When you click on a specific pad, it will automatically jump to that section in the arrangement window. The performance will continuously loop a section until you jump to another. This is great for solo performers or DJs that need long continuous loops.","Sequel 3 is available for both PC and Mac users. There are video tutorials on the manufacturer&#39;s website that are helpful to first-time users. You&#39;ll need to create a Steinberg account to use additional help features such as email."]},"id":"1d3ff8f3-e8a2-42bf-a9a2-8d1e9e14a639","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9d72bbd0-f0ce-4e99-b2a1-d42e348f52fe","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Sequel 3 has some highlight features including the performance track and VST Amp Simulator, but the software isn&#39;t as intuitive and easy to use as other beat making software.
