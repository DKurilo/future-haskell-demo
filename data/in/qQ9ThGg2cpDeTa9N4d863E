The best-selling <a href=\"/best-upright-vacuum-cleaners\">upright vacuum</a> in Dyson&#39;s product line-up gets our respect for its maneuverability, great filtration and overall dirt-trapping capabilities."]},"id":"adb462d8-490e-4b76-a805-4a53022735ce","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Performance"},"id":"9f63dc37-a98e-4e84-952f-f49b087df688","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Dyson DC25 has a neatly contoured, space-age appearance, but do not let that fool you into thinking this is a mere toy. This vacuum is equipped with a strong 1,200-watt motor that, together with the vacuum’s design, offers excellent cleaning power.","You get Dyson’s patented Root Cyclone technology with this bagless upright vacuum cleaner, which gives you powerful suction that does not wane as you continue cleaning. A motorized brush bar loosens dirt and dust from carpeting. The vacuum’s suction power pulls the resulting mess into the vacuum’s canister, and the Dyson DC25 separates the gunk from air by centrifugal force. The vacuum cleaner also adapts itself to different carpet heights, ensuring strong suction while in deep pile carpeting as well as carpet with shorter pile.","If you turn the brush bar off to protect bare floors or delicate floor coverings, you can clean those areas the same way with this vacuum cleaner’s suction power pulling in surface dirt, dust bunnies and whatever else is making floors unclean. You will find the rolling brush bar easy to use with its fingertip controls.","The Dyson DC25 Ball All Floors upright vacuum is equipped with a washable lifetime HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter that captures tiny particles of dirt, bacteria and allergens, and the result is that the vacuum blows air back into the house that is substantially cleaner than the air the vacuum sucked up in the first place.","The manufacturers of HEPA filters create filters that must live up to standards of air filtration comparable to those set by the United States Department of Energy. In addition, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has bestowed its patented “asthma and allergy friendly” certification to Dyson because of the superior filtration.","Since the filter is washable, you will not have to keep buying expensive replacement filters. Simply wash and rinse the filter, let it dry thoroughly and stick it back into the vacuum cleaner. In addition, since this is bagless, there will be no extra costs for bags, nor do you have to purchase any belts. Given its trim size, this vacuum also is easy to store."]},"id":"c900b093-391b-444f-82c1-5d9bdda298f3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Price"},"id":"83a3e5cf-ed8d-430e-a5e9-5e44c7465783","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["One of the many unique qualities about this upright vacuum is the fact that it perches on and moves around on a ball instead of four wheels. It might take you a little bit of time to get used to this different way of moving the machine, but Dyson fans swear by it.","You will find that with this unusual ball technology you can ease the Dyson DC25 in and around furniture and into cramped corners in a smooth and speedy fashion, making short work of what might have been a much more tedious job with a heavier and less well- designed vacuum. However, while you are sliding this vacuum amid the maze of furniture in your home, you are pulling up dirt deeply embedded in the carpeting or unpleasantly spread out on top of bare floors.","The proof of this vacuum’s power is clearly visible in the clear canister bin, which can hold one-third of a gallon of debris. When you observe just how much gunk has been lurking on your floors and how well the Dyson DC25 has removed it, you will understand why the Dyson DC25 upright vacuum has become the company’s most popular model.","Emptying the bin on this bagless upright is a quick and simple process. You just push a button and all the collected dust and dirt drops out from the bottom into the rubbish container of your choice, without you having to touch any mess or yank out any clogs.","The Dyson DC25 employs a 24.6-foot power cord and features a telescopic wand that, together, give the machine a cleaning reach of more than 40 feet. The wand is especially helpful when it comes to cleaning stairs and hard-to-reach places such as tall bookshelves. You can pull it out in one motion and it is all one piece. This saves you from having to put together different lengths of a wand device before you can keep on cleaning.","At only 16 pounds, this vacuum is substantially lighter than most other vacuum cleaners produced by major manufacturers, but it can do plenty of work and do it well without all that extra poundage. Its light weight not only makes the cleaning easier, but also makes it less arduous to carry it up and down stairs."]},"id":"8b38780a-366b-4bb1-94eb-fdc02a6bdc77","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Convenience &amp; Design"},"id":"2b4ee0bb-2dcb-4cb5-af45-bc225f5d46ca","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Besides the 16-foot “quick draw” wand, the Dyson DC25 comes with another “combination” nozzle that handles debris.
