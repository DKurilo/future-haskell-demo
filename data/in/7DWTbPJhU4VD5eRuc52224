This was received with skepticism by many users because previous iPhones have notoriously brittle glass screens. However, Apple claims this glass is the most durable on the market and was added to the iPhone to allow for easy wireless charging, which is the other major new feature. Our sister site, Tom&#39;s Guide, performed drop tests and found the glass to be more durable than expected. When dropped onto wood at heights exceeding 6 feet, the glass was unscathed. The only damage it sustained, a minor crack, came from dropping it onto concrete from about 4 feet.","Like the iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 Plus doesn&#39;t have a 3.5mm audio jack. Apple framed its omission as a way to remove old technology so that the phone could be slimmer. However, it has been a sticking point for many users, especially audiophiles who prefer the audio quality of a wired connection, which also doesn&#39;t drain the battery as fast as a wireless signal.
