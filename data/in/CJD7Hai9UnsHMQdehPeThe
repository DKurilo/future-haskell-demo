This <a href=\"/best-will-software\">will software</a> collection comes with two parts, one for creating your last will and testament and another for creating an advance healthcare directive (living will) with a durable healthcare power of attorney.

In general, most U.S. states, upon your death, will release your estate to your spouse and/or children. However, not every state does this, so composing a will is imperative if you want your wishes to be enforced. Standard Legal offers the tools you need to create a will that covers things such as specific gifting provisions, directing the sales of property and assets, final disposition documents and executor documents. This will software also includes “self-authenticating” features, which means in states that allow it you can endorse your will without having to use a notary public. One bonus feature that this software provides is an Assets and Accounts List form for organizing bank account, insurance, stocks, bonds and other liquid asset information.","The second part of Complete Family Wills is Living Will software. This software can handle complex healthcare directives and HIPPA medical release authorizations. The second part of this Standard Legal will software is a highly valuable inclusion, since it can help you create legal documents to relate what you want to have done if you become seriously injured or ill. These documents cover not just your living will but also the Durable Healthcare Power of Attorney. This person is the one you appoint to be your healthcare agent should you get into a position in which you cannot make those decisions for yourself. These legal healthcare documents can also cover life support situations and life or death healthcare decisions."]},"id":"09d912ba-c2fa-4942-9e67-c7aa65aac77a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Documents Created"},"id":"5e877397-d97c-43e0-b5c4-9f43783f1096","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Complete Family Wills is not as easy to use as some of the higher-ranked products; however, that does not mean it is difficult to use.
