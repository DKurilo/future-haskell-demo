You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","As navigation GPS units have to compete with smartphones, many are moving toward becoming an all-in-one device. The Magellan RoadMate 9250T-LMB offers a wide range of features to connect with many of the devices in your vehicle, but it may have crossed into the territory of being too much hardware for its own good.","The biggest issue with the Magellan RoadMate 9250T-LMB is its massive bulk. While bigger is better with many devices, the GPS should never obstruct the driver&#39;s view. With its huge 7-inch screen, this RoadMate is getting close to being too large. Since most people position their GPS devices on the windshield or dash, we&#39;re concerned that this unit creates an unnecessary blind spot. The alternative is to set the device below the dash, but then you have to look away from the road to see the instructions. This device doesn&#39;t need to be this big. On top of its problematic size, the battery only holds a half an hour worth of charge.","While the Magellan RoadMate 9250T-LMB fails in size, it makes up for it in navigation. The maps are large and easily visible, thanks to the huge screen. In addition to its great maps, lane assist shows the direction that each lane will travel and what lane you should get into for your next turn or exit. You can also count on this GPS for lifetime traffic and map updates. Unfortunately, there is no option for creating custom points of interest, but using the free map updates will ensure you always have current information. Also, this RoadMate does not offer voice recognition, which limits its hands-free potential. All things considered, you can rely on this GPS to get you where you&#39;re going.","The Magellan RoadMate 9250T-LMB offers some interesting extra features, like Bluetooth connectivity to your smartphone. This way, you&#39;ll be able to read texts from your GPS and take calls without holding your phone. If you own a backup camera, this device acts as a display with fantastic resolution and image quality.","Magellan&#39;s website is easy to navigate and FAQs, downloads and online copies of the instruction manual can be found on the support page. On that page, you will also find a phone number, an email address and another point of access to the knowledgebase forum. The service representatives are knowledgeable and quick to respond."]},"id":"f0fb5b01-2f9d-4fb5-907b-65e9481ee7f6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"f0d0e07e-7a05-4ceb-aa6e-68b30a687d72","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Magellan RoadMate 9250T-LMB is a good navigation GPS, but its large size makes it hard to recommend.
