As the credit card concept expanded, more issuers began using them in the 1920s, particularly hotel chains, to give consumers an alternative to carrying cash. By the 1950s, when the Diners Club, American Express and Bank of America all launched charge and credit cards, the idea of buying things on credit was picking up steam.","Some of the first cards, including the Diners Club card (which was made of cardboard), were charge cards, as opposed to credit cards. With a charge card, buyers could make purchases with their cards and later had to pay the entire balance due, rather than just a portion of the balance.","As salespeople did more business on the road in the 1960s, credit card companies began promoting their services heavily to employers. By this time, MasterCard and Visa   which evolved from the first Bank of America card   were considered time-saving instruments as much as credit services, and revolving credit balances had come into vogue. Rather than paying off debts in full with each cycle, users could carry balances forward to the next month while paying finance charges for this privilege. With finance charges becoming the norm, <a href=\"/best-credit-card-processing\">credit card processing</a> evolved into a lucrative business.","Next, with a rapid rise in card use in the 1970s, Congress began regulating credit card processing and business practices. It had one thing on the agenda: stopping the mass mailing of cards to people who had not applied for them. While the government was looking at ways to regulate the industry, Visa and MasterCard were exploring the development of associations for credit-card issuers. These associations allowed banks that wanted to issue cards to share the costs of promoting the Visa and MasterCard brands, among other things. In addition, the associations helped credit-card issuers find and work with processing services.","Throughout this period, American Express maintained a charge card and issued it mostly for business, entertainment and travel, but in the late 1980s, the company launched a credit card to compete in the revolving-credit market. The Discover card came out in the 1980s as well. It was designed to be used by a specific merchant network. Under this plan, Discover could be used only at establishments that had become part of the Discover network.","In recent years, credit card safety has come into question, particularly the ease with which cards or numbers can be stolen by identity thieves. Online services such as PayPal and Google Checkout have stepped in to offer credit options that dispense with a card altogether, at least for online payments for goods and services.","By the late 1990s, Americans were using more than 1 billion traditional credit cards. Add to that the large number of debit and check cards now in use, and it s clear that the concept and practice of paying with cards is unlikely to change significantly anytime soon. Businesses that adopt merchant accounts and provide the means for customers to make card payments offer the greatest flexibility for their customers and are often rewarded with higher sales."]},"id":"16c5d9fc-efeb-4849-bfa9-267e9321df74","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_6260","url":"/evolution-of-the-credit-card","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-hicks","url":"/author/jennifer-hicks","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Hicks","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"m6DJLsYwJmcJdjxe4yY9kY","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-07-11T16:45:20Z","datePublished":"2011-07-11T16:45:20Z","name":"Evolution of the Credit Card","synopsis":"The concept of purchasing goods and services on credit goes back as far as the mid-19th  century, when buyers used instruments such as metal charge plates and coins to carry out transactions with spec","review":{},"strapline":"The concept of purchasing goods and services on credit goes back as far as the mid-19th  century, when buyers used instruments such as metal charge plates and coins to carry out transactions with spec","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-05-19T20:10:05Z","id":"Lph3ajDc3oUb76MZbj3Hdj","meta":{"title":"Evolution of the Credit Card","description":"Buying on credit is nothing new."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:58:03Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/TkPhLRQUi6feGTKjV3ZmRh.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:58:03Z","mimeType":"","name":"6260-evolution-of-the-credit-card.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6260-evolution-of-the-credit-card.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:58:03Z","id":"TkPhLRQUi6feGTKjV3ZmRh","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TkPhLRQUi6feGTKjV3ZmRh.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Evolution of the Credit Card","description":"Buying on credit is nothing new."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/TkPhLRQUi6feGTKjV3ZmRh.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:58:03Z","mimeType":"","name":"6260-evolution-of-the-credit-card.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/6260-evolution-of-the-credit-card.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:58:03Z","id":"TkPhLRQUi6feGTKjV3ZmRh","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TkPhLRQUi6feGTKjV3ZmRh.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Evolution of the Credit Card","description":"Buying on credit is nothing new."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/business/articles/evolution-of-the-credit-card/","label":"","tags":[]}
