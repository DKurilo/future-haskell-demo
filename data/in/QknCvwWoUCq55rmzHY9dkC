Well, not quite, but you get the idea. Too many of us can relate to that feeling when you drop your phone and can&#39;t stop it from hitting the ground – your iPhone&#39;s life flashes before your eyes! Or even that feeling when your iPhone decided to take a swim. But with an iPhone case that&#39;s designed to protect your phone in these kinds of events, those feelings can be greatly lessened and even diminished.","Just as technology evolves, iPhone cases also evolve and have become much more than a simple sleeve of protection for your valuable device. Some iPhone cases can even be used to mount your smartphone in your car for navigation, and some even prop your phone up with a small kickstand for easy movie viewing and FaceTime chats. There are endless possibilities.","An iPhone case can be minimal and functional, simply protecting  your device, or it can show off your personality. We&#39;ve gathered information of a plethora of cases that do both.","<strong>iPhone Cases: What to Look For</strong>","iPhone cases have become all the rage in the last few years, but with so many to choose from, it can become difficult to decide which case will be the most functional and provide your top-of-the-line smartphone with some additional style. When you&#39;re looking for a case, keep in mind the following elements.","<strong>Performance</strong><br/>Every iPhone case has a job. It&#39;s a pretty simple one, but a job nonetheless. To protect. A quality iPhone case will protect your phone from scratches, dings, cracks and other terrifying traumas. But not all iPhone cases protect the same – some provide extreme protection while others provide just sufficient protection.","<strong>Design</strong><br/>Design is important in an iPhone case, not only for the overall look, but also for durability, functionality and variety. An iPhone case that keeps your device functional, while also being made of durable material to do its job in protecting your device, is golden.","<strong>Warranty</strong><br/>With as much as we use our iPhones every day, a good, lengthy warranty on the case that protects that iPhone is important. A one-year limited warranty is pretty standard for an iPhone case. Most warranties guarantee against manufacturer and factory defects.","iPhone cases can express your personality and style, but protection is still key in a good case. An iPhone case should provide you with peace of mind that your treasured device is safe, even if it does take a tumble."]},"id":"91d2c439-2afa-4db7-8566-cdce00bec369","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_986","url":"/best-iphone-cases","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeff-ropelato","url":"/author/jeff-ropelato","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeff Ropelato","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"ZFTp4R9MHcSeWJm9weTSoE","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-09-06T18:38:26Z","datePublished":"2012-10-30T18:56:03Z","name":"iPhone Cases Review","synopsis":"iPhone cases provide style and protect your phone from elements and accidents.
