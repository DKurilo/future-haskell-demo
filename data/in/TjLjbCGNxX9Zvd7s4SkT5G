In this round of reviews, weâ€™ve added several weeksâ€™ of researching home networking products, with 25 hours dedicated solely to the study of Ethernet switches, to our years of evaluating and testing networking gear. Weâ€™ve learned their pros, their cons, how they work, their differences from other tech and most importantly which ones are the smartest investments. After all that research, we know this tech backwards and forwards, and weâ€™re sharing our wealth of knowledge in an easily-digestible form. We want your Ethernet connections to be plentiful and up to the task of keeping your desktops, laptops, gaming consoles, printers, TVs and anything else you want to connect to your router performing at top speeds. We sort through hundreds of products, seller listings, user reviews and online content to highlight only the best products so that you can make informed buying decisions easily.","<strong>How We Evaluated</strong><br/>Our team is intimately familiar with networking products after spending weeks researching the subject. We spent 25 hours learning about Ethernet switches alone. In all our testing and researching processes, we strive to recreate the consumer experience as closely as possible so that we can provide the information you want and need in the same buying process. Our study of Ethernet switches began by asking the same questions you would ask when looking to add another piece of equipment to your home or officeâ€™s network: What is an Ethernet switch? Why would someone need one? Which are the best options? We found the answers to these questions by digging through the wealth of information available to us online in the form of product descriptions, features lists, user reviews and manufacturer resources. We found highly rated, top performing Ethernet switches and compared them against each other in a battle royal of technical specs and product features.","<strong>Types of Ethernet SwitchesÂ </strong><br/>The first differentiation between different types of Ethernet switches is whether a switch is modular or fixed configuration. Modular switches are flexible because you can add to them to meet different needs. Fixed configuration switches have a set number of ports and components.","Fixed configuration switches can be further divided into managed and unmanaged switches. Managed switches are flexible and give you more control over your network. The three products we recommend are all unmanaged switches, which require no programming or configuration. These are easier to use and set up than managed switches and work well for home networks and small businesses. They are also less expensive than managed switches.","<strong>What to Look For:Â </strong>","Price<br/>Unmanaged Ethernet switches are inexpensive. Many of the products we reviewed cost $25 or less and have five or eight ports. Many products in this price range support Gigabit speeds as well. For most people, an affordable, plug-and-play unmanaged switch is best. Managed switches are more complex and cost anywhere from $100 to over $1,000.","Ports<br/>It is important to buy an Ethernet switch with the appropriate number of ports to fit your needs. We recommend choosing a product with enough ports to connect all your computers, consoles and other devices plus one to connect the switch to your router. Typically, switches are available with five, eight, 16, 24 or 48 ports.","Speed<br/>Most people will be best served by a Gigabit Ethernet switch supporting 10/100/1000 Mbps switching speeds, with some switches able to handle twice that while in Full-Duplex mode. Fast Ethernet switches are ten times slower, by comparison, and still cost about the same. In your network, you want all your components to be at or above the speeds you intend to use, otherwise something like a switch could create limitations. Even if you donâ€™t have anything in your network that can handle Gigabit speeds, purchasing a Gigabit Ethernet switch is a sound investment if you plan to upgrade any connected devices in the future.","<strong>What is an Ethernet Switch?</strong>","An Ethernet switch is a home networking device designed to connect several wired Ethernet devices to a network through one Ethernet connection to your router. Ethernet switches are useful if you have more wired devices than ports on your router, or if there are several wired devices in the same area that is far away from your router. Switches organize the information passing through the router to optimize transfer speeds. In this way, switches differ from older Ethernet hubs, which are similar devices that split a single Ethernet connection among multiple inputs and outputs. Instead of sorting the information and sending data only to the intended destinations, hubs repeat data to all locations besides the origin, which can slow down a network significantly.","Ethernet switches are also distinct from routers. Routers manage your home network. They connect to your modem and every other internet-using device in your home, either through wired or wireless connections. Routers generally have more than one Ethernet port, as well as network switching capabilities similar to those of Ethernet switches. Although a router with multiple ports could be used in place of a switch, an Ethernet switch cannot replace a router in your home networking setup, for various functional and security reasons. Your Ethernet switch should be connected to your router through a wired connection. The order of networking equipment from your ISP connection should be the modem, router, Ethernet switch (optional) and your device. Because they are wired, Ethernet switches are also different from wireless network switches and wireless access points.","<strong>More Guides for Home Networking:</strong>","<a href=\"/best-cable-modems\">Best Cable Modems</a>","<a href=\"/best-wireless-routers\">Best Wireless Routers</a>","<a href=\"/best-wi-fi-boosters\">Best Wi-Fi Extenders</a>"]},"id":"cf7cbf43-0b5a-4c63-9918-97aed4c08704","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_132","url":"/best-ethernet-switches","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-18T08:02:55Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-01-18T19:12:00Z","datePublished":"2019-01-18T19:12:00Z","name":"Best Ethernet Switches of 2019","synopsis":"The more common type of switch, known as a form factor switch, has up to 48 ports and is typically used in smaller networks or at home.","review":{},"strapline":"The more common type of switch, known as a form factor switch, has up to 48 ports and is typically used in smaller networks or at home.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-01-22T19:57:33Z","id":"TjLjbCGNxX9Zvd7s4SkT5G","meta":{"title":"Best Ethernet Switches of 2019 -
