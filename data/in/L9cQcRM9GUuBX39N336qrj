This frame is great for instant gratification – go on an adventure, take the photos, come back and enjoy the memories right away.","This is a winner in terms of user friendliness; there is nothing easier than simply plugging in the memory card from your camera and enjoying your photos. The problem is you might not have a memory card or a camera. Most photos now live on cell phones or computers, but if you still use a digital camera, this photo frame might be just right.","The VFM820-50 has no internal storage, and the options for getting photos on screen are lacking, especially since there isn’t a USB port. However, if you look in ViewSonic&#39;s catalog, there are other, pricier options that do have USB compatibility.","We were only able to evaluate it using the test photos on our camera card, while we were able to try other digital photo frames on a range of source material, including USB jump drives, photos from our social media accounts and even the internal memory on some electronic photo frames. We found that the real problem with this frame is its lukewarm photo reproduction. The photos we were able to test looked good but not amazing, especially in comparison to the image quality of other frames we reviewed.","Digital frames you can hang on the wall are more versatile, and that is not an option with this device.  Still, it is easy to fit on even the most crowded desktop with its ultra-slim profile. There is no remote control, but the buttons and menu make it pretty easy to maneuver this frame."]},"id":"9da96229-6ad6-468f-8911-e8ccbae04bf4","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"fdd2fcbc-8878-472c-9b17-eded2a1245e0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The best digital picture frames offer many options for getting your digital photos on their screens, and the ViewSonic VFM820-50 only has one.
