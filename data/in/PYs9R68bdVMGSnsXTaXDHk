Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The ASUS RT-N10<strong> </strong>EZ N Wireless Router, from ASUSTek Computer Inc., lacks the parental controls of other routers but supports guest networking, a feature lacking in comparable routers. If price is a consideration as you select one of the <a href=\"/best-wireless-routers\">wireless routers</a>, this one rocks.","The ASUS RT-N10 EZ N has a theoretical wireless data speed of 150Mbps because it conforms to the single-stream 802.11n specification, as opposed to the dual-stream wireless n specification. So it is at least three times faster than the previous wireless g generation products but about half as fast as the fastest wireless n routers. Consistent with its role among entry-level home wireless routers, the internet-connection port is Fast Ethernet (as are its local area network ports). Wireless n routers designed for extreme gamers and profession office environments have Gigabit Ethernet ports instead of Fast Ethernet.","In order to make the most of available bandwidth, users can assign bandwidth priorities so that the router knows which multimedia applications need guaranteed performance. ASUSTek Computer calls this feature EZQoS (marketing speak for Wi-Fi Multimedia Quality of Service). Wi-Fi Multimedia (formerly known as Wireless Multimedia Extensions) prioritizes traffic according to four categories: voice, video, best effort and background. The standard takes into account various environmental and traffic conditions. Without Quality of Service, every application has an equal opportunity to transmit over the Wi-Fi network, which is fine for web browsers, file transfers or email. Applications such as interactive gaming and video streaming require Quality of Service in order to elevate their priority above applications that are less sensitive to latency.","The firewall includes Network Address Translation (NAT) and Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI). NAT presents a single network IP address to the internet, behind which all of the network-attached devices can hide. SPI examines data packets to discover any clues that a hacker might be the source. The router can encrypt wireless sessions with WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) or WPA/WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access). WEP is not the best encryption but it is necessary to support legacy clients. WPA2 represents the state of the art for encrypting wireless sessions. The router also detects and logs intrusions. Other security features are guest networking and the ability to authenticate based on Media Access Control address. The product can also filter ports, IP packets, URL keywords and Media Access Control addresses.","ASUS RT-N10 EZ N includes an &#34;EZSetup&#34; utility to configure internet and wireless connectivity. Administration is via browser. Remote management is supported.","ASUSTek Computer provides downloadable firmware and utilities from its website, which also posts coverage details and allows users to manage the status of repairs. The product includes a one-year warranty. Technical support is provided in a user forum."]},"id":"88a72e8a-6e7b-4a0a-837f-0e41d5e8722e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"1992f515-f0d6-4e45-8612-368e71aebeae","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The ASUS RT-N10<strong> </strong>EZ N Wireless Router is rich in features and easy to install, configure and manage.
