The original review is below, but check out our current top <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-3d-printers,review-2236.html\">3D Printers</a> here.</em>","The Ditto Pro is a 3D plastic printer for PLA filament. When selecting the file you want to print, the included software helps you customize the print speed and quality settings for the best possible printed models. This printer also comes with a one-year warranty and is compatible with many different operating systems.","Desktop 3D printers usually don&#39;t have extremely large print spaces, as they are meant to fit in your home office or garage. The Ditto Pro has an average print capacity and can print items up to about 9 x 7 x 9 inches in size. Prints speeds can reach up to 120 mm per second, which ensures you get fast, quality prints. The print resolution is variable and ranges from .05 to .03 mm in thickness. Depending on the quality of print you aim for, the Ditto Pro can deliver.","With the Ditto Pro, only 1.75 mm PLA filament is compatible, as ABS filament isn’t supported. However, the machine accepts universal cartridges, so you can purchase PLA either from the manufacturer or from a retail supplier. There is also only one print head, so multicolor printing isn’t an option.","The Ditto Pro is designed with an open C frame, which is exactly what it sounds like. Unlike other 3D printers, however, the frame is made out of a single piece of aluminum. The Ditto Pro weighs a little more than 22 pounds, making it easy to move. The glass plate is removable, so you don’t have to struggle getting your parts off the plate while it&#39;s still on the printer. Other useful qualities include a quick swap extruder and automatic temperature settings. The LCD screen and dial make the Ditto Pro an easy printer to navigate. The biggest problem with this printer’s design is the lack of a heated platform, which would allow you to print ABS.","The best home 3D printers are easy to connect to, giving you lots of printing freedom. The Ditto Pro is SD card ready, so you can save your files to the card, plug it in and start printing without connecting your computer. Alternatively, you can plug in the USB cord and print from there. The Ditto Pro printer and software are also compatible with Windows and Mac operating systems, but not Linux.","This 3D printer comes equipped with many of the accessories you need to start printing right away. Along with your printer, you&#39;ll find a power supply, USB cable and starter filament cartridge in the box. There are no maintenance tools, but there is also no assembly required, so you won&#39;t need them for the initial set up. The Tinkerine Suite software is available from the Tinkerine website and is free to download and use with your printer.","Tinkerine, a Canadian company, backs the Ditto Pro and provides a one-year warranty for this 3D printer. It&#39;s easy to contact representatives via email or phone for technical support. You can also reference the manual, forum and FAQs if you have further questions. Video tutorials are not available on the site, though, so you have to rely on the manual for most of your printer use."]},"id":"e013741c-aac1-4da8-904c-185631a0fb28","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b0467c32-2eab-490f-a019-0a75437c2c5b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Compared to other 3D printers we reviewed, the Ditto Pro is a lighter, more equipped printer.
