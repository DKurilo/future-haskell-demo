Its Kreepy Krauly cleaner line offers a full range of robotic, suction and <a href=\"/best-pressure-pool-cleaners\">pressure pool cleaners</a>. The Legend is designed with a large intake valve for pools that are surrounded by landscaping. For homeowners who need large debris removed from their pool, including acorns, twigs, leaves and even rocks, this pressure pool cleaner is a great solution.","This pool cleaner could help reduce wear and tear on your pool’s filter, leaving your skimmer to remove bacterial agents from the water. Also, its efficiency should help reduce dependency upon chemicals to keep the water clean. The Legend includes many contemporary features of a pressure cleaner. It has a large debris filter bag and extra-large intake throat to suck up debris. It requires a booster pump for optimal operation. You need to ensure the booster pump is timed to operate alongside your pool’s pump or it will eventually burn out. The Legend has a four-wheel design to help keep it from tipping. The front-wheel drive helps pull the vacuum up walls and over obstacles like drains. The <a href=\"/kreepy-krauly-review\">Kreepy Krauly Racer</a> also has a four-wheel design, but it has smaller wheels in back to give it a little more maneuverability in the water. Both models are designed for stability.","A backup valve fires every three minutes automatically to ensure that your entire pool surface is cleaned efficiently. The pressure relief valve helps control water flow and consistent speed during the cleaning cycle. The vacuum has a lightweight body so it should be able to cover all pool surfaces, including stairs. A rear hose sweeps the corners and pool surfaces to dislodge and scrub silt and fine particles. The vacuum is strong enough to clean the average-size pool in one to three hours. The wheel treads should provide decent traction and are gentle enough for any pool surface, including vinyl. The kit includes a 30-foot feed hose. Pentair supplies a one-year limited warranty.","A booster pump must be installed if you don’t already have one. You may need to adjust the length of the feed hose based on the size of your pool. You should observe the cleaning process at least once to ensure that the vacuum doesn’t get tangled.","This is a moderately priced pool cleaner from a reputable manufacturer. It is versatile enough for most pool sizes and can clean all pool surfaces. Just be aware that a booster pump is required for operation."]},"id":"87db0d08-9137-421b-847c-755c1efd7782","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_66574","url":"/kreepy-krauly-legend-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-08-14T18:31:54Z","datePublished":"2015-08-14T18:31:54Z","name":"Kreepy Krauly Legend","synopsis":"Pentair has been servicing the home and commercial pool market for decades.
