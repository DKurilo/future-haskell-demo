You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Google&#39;s Nexus 5 is the company&#39;s latest and best <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a>. Manufactured by LG, the Nexus 5 enjoys an incredibly fast processor and is the first phone that features the newest version of Android: 4.4, also known as KitKat. Although KitKat brings some great improvements to the operating system, it&#39;s been installed on a phone that, processor aside, is underwhelming. With a weak camera and poor battery life, it&#39;s not as dependable as some of the other devices you can buy.","The Nexus 5 features an IPS display slightly less than 5 inches from corner to corner. With 1080p resolution, it is stunningly crisp, vibrant and easy to see from any angle. The display dominates the front of a phone with an otherwise simple design; available in black or white, the Nexus 5 is comfortable to hold, but it&#39;s not much more than a rounded rectangle.","That screen provides a window into Android 4.4, the newest version of Google&#39;s mobile OS. KitKat brings with it a cleaner, more streamlined interface, under-the-hood improvements to stability and performance, and Google Now accessibility from the home screen. This last feature can be particularly useful; if you&#39;re on a home screen, you can simple say &#34;OK, Google&#34; and the phone will react to your voice, without your needing to press a button.","As nice as KitKat can be, especially for fans of Android, the phone&#39;s hardware features don&#39;t quite measure up to its software. The 8-megapixel camera takes pictures through a surprisingly small ƒ/2.5 aperture. When it comes to aperture size, lower numbers mean bigger apertures, which in turn mean more light hitting the camera&#39;s sensor and better-quality pictures. Most modern phones have apertures around ƒ/2.2. Lesser-quality cameras have ƒ/2.4 apertures. The Nexus 5&#39;s aperture is the smallest of all the top smartphones we&#39;ve reviewed, and you can see it in its photos: dull, lifeless and prone to blur.","The Nexus 5&#39;s battery is equally disappointing. While you can get about 15 hours of talk time off of the phone, activities that use the screen drain its battery quickly – you&#39;ll only be able to watch video or surf the web for a combined total of about five hours before taking the battery to empty from a full charge. Given how often we tend to turn on a smartphone&#39;s screen throughout the day, you could have trouble making it through a heavy workday without plugging the phone in somewhere along the way."]},"id":"6bc3351e-adb7-485c-8595-a0ff830d4331","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"976e230c-2958-43a3-ba49-9dfff4cd048c","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For $350 off-contract, the Nexus 5 is a good deal if you want to buy and own a smartphone.
