is <a href=\"/best-genealogy-software\">genealogy software for Mac</a> that creates extensive charts and reports about your family. You can connect to FamilySearch and other online databases through the software to search for family records. This software is easy to navigate, with intuitive menus and a clean interface. You don&#39;t have to dig through menus and sidebars to find the features you want. However, this Mac genealogy software lacks a tool for inputting DNA results. This isn&#39;t a major omission, but it would&#39;ve come in handy for helping you find origins in your ancestry.","Reunion is great for printing custom family tree charts. It has six chart templates and 14 report templates. The charts include a standard pedigree, descendant, timeline or fan chart. This program also generates several documents we rarely see. The Events Report shows a chronological list of events for everyone in your family, and the Multimedia Usage Report provides a list of media and source links to help you catch any unsourced pieces. The On-This-Date Report shows information about a person and their family for a specific date.","The charting and media options make Reunion good for creating webpages. It exports your information to a custom webpage where you can edit the content and layout using Reunion&#39;s tools. You can also create a report specifically designed for the web with this Mac genealogy software. On your page, you can link your family tree chart to family cards, person sheets, media and sources.","Because a lot of genealogical research occurs online, it&#39;s important that you can search the web within your family tree software, and Reunion has these web-enabled features. You can import GEDCOM files from online databases to the software. When you import a GEDCOM file, Reunion automatically places the information from it directly into your database. This Mac software also makes it easy to add images you find online. When you find online images, you can just drag and drop the images into Reunion to add them to the program.","When it comes to charting and reporting features, Reunion is one of the best genealogy software packages for Mac. It has features to organize extensive lists of individuals. The Sort Children tool arranges children by birthdates in all families or families with a marked parent. You can also chart patterns based on this information. For further organization, the numbering option lets you override standard numbering and track smaller subsets within your family file.","Citations need to link to their sources and be in a standard format, especially if you plan to share your work in a professional or academic context. Reunion creates correctly formatted citations for print and digital sources for you. Using the simple data fields, you just type in the author, title, date and any other required details for Reunion to create a correctly formatted citation. You can even add custom fields if there are any details you want to add about your source. Although you can export your work, these source citations won&#39;t export with your text data. If you plan to publish or share your work, this could be a problem.","Reunion has a helpful website with video tutorials and a FAQs section to answer questions and increase your expertise in using the software. A talk forum on the website lets you interact with other users of the software. You can reach customer service via email or phone, and the support team is friendly and helpful. The website specifies that phone service is limited to 15 minutes a day, but customer service reps are also available via live chat."]},"id":"4540a422-27d8-4abe-bdb0-ec7393751780","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"884a20f9-289b-41ab-acdd-fedc71cf6a63","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Reunion&#39;s charting and reporting tools can tackle a variety of documents.
