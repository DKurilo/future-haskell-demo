BlackBerry’s claim to fame has always been its exceptional mobile email functionality and manufacturer Research In Motion (RIM) has steadfastly insisted that a physical keyboard is best suited for typing.

Using the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES), the device is fully compatible with Microsoft Exchange, IBM Lotus Domino, and Novell GroupWise. That allows for remote synchronization not only of email but also of corporate calendars, contact lists, note pads and to-do lists. It also gives access to other selected organizational data bases. Integration with existing corporate email is simple and IT administrators have the ability to set over 400 different access and security permissions. Data transmission is secured by integrated 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES). In the event of a lost or stolen device, sensitive data can be remotely wiped from it. For users who don’t need the BES, synchronization with computer based calendar, contact list and task lists such as MS Outlook can be accomplished using the included BlackBerry Desktop Manager.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"c78f996c-c62c-4eb2-b5c9-46cff8ef64eb","type":"text"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Storm features a 3.2-megapixel, 2x zoom, auto-focus camera with a flash.

It hangs onto its business phone roots but offers an excellent suite of multimedia and consumer features. Its SureTouch screen makes it excellent for typing compared to other touchscreens but still isn’t as usable as a physical keyboard for that purpose. We’ll have to wait and see how reliable the suspended screen proves to be. Its media player is terrific except when compared to iPhone’s integrated iPod. Overall, there aren’t many devices that pack as much of a punch as this one.<br/><br/>"]},"id":"a8f919aa-9bfe-4aa8-974f-6df683b1ca40","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_27436","url":"/blackberry-storm-9530-24219-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-11-24T07:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-11-24T07:00:00Z","name":"BlackBerry Storm storm 9530","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":45,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-06-02T22:16:26Z","id":"uWLydj3rWjZmRiCn8oiYMX","meta":{"title":"BlackBerry Storm storm 9530 Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
