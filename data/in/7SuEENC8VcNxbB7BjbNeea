500s are intensely stylish and sleek for <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-headphones,review-1988.html\">bass headphones</a>. With rumbling bass at high volumes and a convenient cable, complete with remote, these are some of the best headphones for bass. Despite the heavy earcups, the headband design doesn&#39;t wobble or constrict your head, so your bass beats can keep pumping.","The Pro 500s have all the right specs to boost the bass in your playlist. High power output provides all 1,000 megawatts of clear sound. The over-ear, closed design is perfect for headphones with good bass. The 50 mm drivers allow for strong, deep bass reproduction, and the 20-20,000Hz frequency matches human hearing exactly so you&#39;ll never miss a beat. Even though the Pro 500s don&#39;t go impressively low compared to other bass headphones, they still pack a punch at high volumes. This set has no noise isolation, so if you want to hear booming bass, everyone else has to as well.","With an inline remote and microphone, the Yamaha Pro 500s offers you control of your music. The Pro 500s don&#39;t require battery powered noise cancellation, which is great if you don&#39;t want to worry about charging batteries. The included solid carrying case protects your bass headphones from harm or damage.","Like Yamaha&#39;s line of motorcycles, these headphones are sleek, smoking hot and very heavy. At 13 ounces, these bass headphones are not lightweights. They are however very solid and glossy. Two colors and two cables increase the style and usability. You can even fold these solid bass headphones for compact carrying and storage. The earcups get hot and start to feel heavy and uncomfortable after an extended listening period. The ear cushions don&#39;t give and feel more like plastic than pillows.","Yamaha&#39;s music division backs you and your Pro 500s with email and phone support â€“ just look for the Audio &amp; Visual links on the website. You can contact Yamaha directly or through social media sites like Facebook or Twitter for any question or comment. Although conveniently categorized by product, the FAQs only boast two questions for the Pro 500. Yamaha representatives however let us know that they are working on improving the FAQ page of the website. On the support page you can access manual downloads, one-year warranty information, safety information and more."]},"id":"7af46b38-5812-4cef-8665-32279187f9b1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"19c733f2-0879-4eb6-b6a3-61040320ffd7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The best bass headphones have great overall sound quality, a lightweight design and noise isolation for the ultimate bass experience.
