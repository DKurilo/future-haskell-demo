The interior size and adjustable rack positions make it a good choice for casseroles, full sized chickens and other large dinner dishes. Oster sells this extra-large toaster oven for $99.99, which is really good considering the features and size. We found it selling on Amazon for $111.00 at the time of publishing this review so you&#39;re likely better off buying it from the manufacturer.","This is by far the largest toaster oven in our comparison, the second largest being the <a href=\"/kitchenaid-kco253cu-review\">KitchenAid KCO253CU</a>. The digital display is very easy to use and set, but it isn&#39;t very informative during the cooking process and it doesn&#39;t display the current temperature inside the oven. During our bread and bagel testing, the bread didn&#39;t toast evenly. The best toasted slices were the ones in the very middle of unit but the ones in the back and front were only half golden. In our frozen burrito test, we followed the cooking directions found both on the food box and in the toaster oven&#39;s manual. The tortilla burned more than with any other device and the interior had to cool down for quite a while before it could be eaten.","The cookie test didn&#39;t fare any better, being burnt on top and around the edges but super doughy inside. We had to cook them awhile longer before they were ready to eat, but by then the outsides had gotten pretty burned. During the reheat test, the pizza slices reached a warm temperature very quickly. So much so that we found keeping to the allotted 10 minutes burned the cheese, pepperoni and crust. On the bright side, this means you can heat frozen pizzas and reheat previously cooked pizzas in little time. If you take the time to experiment with the rack locations, temperatures and cook times you should be able to get this device to work for you.","Each rack can hold 9 slices of bread a piece so you could technically toast 18 slices at once if you wanted to. Though it&#39;s likely the bottom rack wouldn&#39;t turn out as well as the top rack. In addition to the Toast setting, this device also gives you Bake, Turbo Convection, Broil, Warm and Defrost. It has a pizza preset button to help you cook your frozen pizzas quickly, which is great when you need a quick meal for yourself or your family. The stick resistant interior makes it easier to remove food debris and the wide door makes it especially easy to insert or remove the racks and crumb tray.","There is a 90-minute timer with an automatic shutoff feature so you don&#39;t have to worry about the device overheating. A bake pan is included, but no broiling rack. This toaster oven is only covered by a one-year warranty, which is average, but small considering the cost and size of this unit. We were really impressed by the exterior temperature of this device as it maintained the coolest temperature when in use only reaching 93 degrees on the back side and only 92 degrees on the sides and top. This is incredibly safer than the over 100+ degree temperatures that were common with the other ovens we tested. The handle was slightly warmer than room temperature so you won&#39;t have to worry about a hot handle."]},"id":"f688d445-0891-4f63-8180-d58d211d4532","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"68f3b16a-9dfa-471d-9fbc-d34a198d1de0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Ideal for cooking large meals, this extra-large Oster toaster oven is perfect for families or individuals who don&#39;t own a stove.
