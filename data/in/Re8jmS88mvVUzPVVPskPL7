Its budget DVD players are usually light on features but don’t compromise on image quality, so while you may not be able to watch the latest 3D movie or surf the web, you’ll still be able to enjoy crisp, detailed image quality.","Some Toshiba DVD players are region-free, but not all, so if you want to watch discs from more than one region, make sure you double-check before purchase. The high-end products allow you to stream content from services such as Hulu.","The majority of Toshiba Blu-ray DVD players have HDMI connectivity, although some connect to your home theater system via SCART. Feature-rich models usually offer internet connectivity, with both wireless and Ethernet options. Some have a USB port so you can easily connect a USB peripheral like a camera to retrieve images, or a USB flash drive to access stored music, movies and files. A Wi-Fi Direct or local area network capability allows you to connect compatible wireless peripherals to your DVD player to easily share content between devices. If you choose a model with this capability, you’ll be able to connect PCs, laptops, smartphones, tablets, cameras and similar wireless devices.","Image quality varies across the Toshiba Blu-ray and DVD player line, starting at 720p, or HD. Many models offer 1080p Full HD, and select products have 4K Ultra HD. A number of the high-end offerings from Toshiba offer 3D playback, making them solid options for additions to a 3D-capable home theater setup. Some Toshiba players automatically improve image quality. This is known as upscaling, which brings low-resolution DVDs to near-HD quality or 1080p to near-Ultra HD.","Most of the smart Blu-ray and DVD players from Toshiba that can connect to the internet feature native apps. These can include catch-up TV services, social media, YouTube, Spotify and PhotoBox, among others. Select models also support web browsing. BD-Live provides many extra features, including deleted scenes, bonus content, online chat and gaming. With high-end products, you’ll also have access to the Toshiba Cloud portal and services, where you can download apps, share content, and download the app so you can control your DVD player from your smart device and maintain a calendar for appointments and important notes."]},"id":"78565f90-ce8c-427c-95e0-a2a30b54bb55","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53441","url":"/toshiba-sd7300-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-08-16T18:31:53Z","datePublished":"2011-08-16T18:31:53Z","name":"Toshiba","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-08-16T18:31:53Z","id":"Re8jmS88mvVUzPVVPskPL7","meta":{"title":"Toshiba Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"With Blu-ray and DVD players for every budget, Toshiba offers feature-packed performance, quality and value.
