You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Easy Hi-Q Recorder is <a href=\"/best-voice-recording-software\">voice recording software</a> by Roemer Software that can be conveniently used for a variety of audio recording applications mainly because of its multiple audio-in options, recording timer and scheduler, and voice-activated recording features. Its latest version is compatible with Windows XP, 7 and 8 and features a straightforward interface.","The audio recording software supports audio input from a microphone and line-in. A “loop back” cable can also be used to connect the speaker line-out port to the line-in to record just about any computer sound – but remember to scale down the output volume just in case. In addition, audio feed can be sourced from PC playback, audio playback, video playback and internet streaming.","Furthermore, your computer’s Wave-Out or Stereo Mix options can be used to record “What You Hear” audio, but the hardware devices may need to be unhidden and enabled in Windows.","You can access the recording window by clicking on the option button; an instruction box will appear with a guide to setting up a hardware connection and system software for recording and playback functions. This guide is quite helpful for first-time users.","Easy Hi-Q Recorder does not offer audio filters to apply to a file once you’ve recorded your voice. The only real editing options are to trim silence and to change between mono and stereo.","You can change file formats by playing a file and recording it to a different format. This process is a bit of a hassle but works well. The automatic split recording tool can be used to split files during recording, to a desired size or time duration.","Files in MP3, WAV, WMA and at least 17 other formats are playable within the voice recording software. However, files can only be recorded and saved to MP3, OGG, WMA and WAV formats.","The program is easy to use, for the most part. The centralized recording options window, with its instructional pop-ups, make things easy to navigate.","The help files within the software are somewhat inadequate, in contrast to the wonderful instructional pop-ups in the option window. The developers offer email support in case you need personalized help, or you can peruse the informational resources on the company’s website, which include tutorials, a FAQs section and regular updates for the program."]},"id":"803cbbd2-8921-4e48-a061-7571679370d0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"af1945f6-67c6-4a86-867e-2b4f477da4bc","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Easy Hi-Q Recorder is basic voice recording software, but it works.
