To illuminate the dark, night vision goggles amplify the little ambient light present in a dark environment or illuminate it with infrared light. A few top night vision goggles include the <a href=\"/outdoor/camping/best-night-vision-goggles/luna-optics-review/\">Luna Optics LN-EM1-MS</a>, the <a href=\"/outdoor/camping/best-night-vision-goggles/bushnell-review/\">Bushnell Equinox Z</a> and the <a href=\"/outdoor/camping/best-night-vision-goggles/night-owl-review/\">Night Owl Optics 5-Power NOXM50</a>.","Night vision goggles used to be only for military use, but as the technology matured and became affordable, these goggles entered the consumer market. Night vision optics work in two ways: light amplification and thermal imaging. Light amplification involves enhancing moonlight, starlight or infrared light. Thermal imaging, or heat vision, also relies on infrared light as it picks up heat given off by objects, animals and people in the visual range of infrared goggles.","<strong>Night Vision Goggles: What to Look For</strong>","There are four generations of night vision devices, and each comes with a different set of capabilities. Here&#39;s what to look out for as you compare the best night vision goggles and pick the right one for your needs.","<strong>Gain </strong><br/>Gain refers to the ability to enhance images even as it gets darker. Typically, night vision falters as the amount of ambient light dwindles and the viewing distance increases. Some night vision goggles compensate by using longer lenses and infrared light, but these are only effective up to a certain point because increasing the gain often reduces clarity. The ideal night vision goggles can boost gain in low light without significantly sacrificing focus.","<strong>Range </strong><br/>To capture objects that are far afield, night vision goggles need a magnification factor higher than 1x. A long and powerful lens is required to achieve this. Unfortunately, long lenses perform poorly in low light. To view objects far away in near-total darkness, a high-speed lens with moderate magnification is best. Such lenses capture more light and have higher gains and longer ranges.","<strong>Image Quality </strong><br/>Night vision goggles produce monochromatic green images because the human eye perceives contrasts more easily in green than any other color. The best night vision images are, therefore, those that remain sharp at the center and the edges. To avoid blurring and distortion, the goggles must produce high-definition images and have a high resolution.","<strong>Mounting Gear </strong><br/>Night vision goggles are worn over the head. Therefore, they must be lightweight and comfortable. Straps and other mounting gear should not chafe the skin, and the rims of the binoculars or monocular should not dig too deep into the eye socket. Comfort and ergonomics are important considerations for those planning to wear their goggles for prolonged periods.","Whether for hunting or security, night vision goggles give you the ability to perceive what the naked eye can&#39;t see. Finding the goggles that match your budget and needs is crucial."]},"id":"8f0e8e2f-f57d-4097-9732-3fa9a160622c","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"6177999a-30ba-4d39-a04b-9411f3114d4a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SYIM3S/?tag=ttr_night-vision-goggles-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1376[art|NA[pid|61700[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Armasight Vega</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WGQ9YI/?tag=ttr_night-vision-goggles-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1376[art|NA[pid|61702[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ATN PVS7-3</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C71K73U/?tag=ttr_night-vision-goggles-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1376[art|NA[pid|61696[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">ATN Viper X-1</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I9CDU44/?tag=ttr_night-vision-goggles-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1376[art|NA[pid|61698[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Bushnell</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UCFTSJW/?tag=ttr_night-vision-goggles-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1376[art|NA[pid|61704[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">EOTech</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00153F5QA/?tag=ttr_night-vision-goggles-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1376[art|NA[pid|61699[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">EyeClops</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006WA4756/?tag=ttr_night-vision-goggles-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1376[art|NA[pid|61695[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Luna Optics</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BVUSSU/?tag=ttr_night-vision-goggles-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1376[art|NA[pid|61701[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Night Owl</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TG2POM/?tag=ttr_night-vision-goggles-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1376[art|NA[pid|61703[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Spy Net</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002HBOQK/?tag=ttr_night-vision-goggles-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1376[art|NA[pid|61697[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Yukon</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"f5e5ff4c-09dc-40a3-afc8-1ed78adb6ecc","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1376","url":"/best-night-vision-goggles","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-08T16:05:37Z","datePublished":"2015-08-10T22:16:28Z","name":"Night Vision Goggles Review","synopsis":"Night vision goggles vary widely by price and capabilities.
