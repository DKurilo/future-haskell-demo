The question of whether the Comodo Antivirus package is any good is an important matter that will be discussed in-depth.","Comodo Antivirus runs off an engine that is quite stable and robust. It can handle almost anything that is thrown at it. One feature offered in the free package is real-time scanning. This means that before files are used on an individual basis, Comodo checks them for viruses. Its host-intrusion protection system blocks spyware, which can utterly ruin a perfectly good computer. Comodo Antivirus also offers heuristic detection, which is something that is not often included in free antivirus software. Heuristic detection methods analyze the behavior of viruses that cannot be identified in order to provide proper identification.","Comodo Antivirus can perform full system scans as well as partial system scans. It can also scan removable drives, including USB drives, CDs and DVDs. Comodo can scan everything, including cell phones, and remove any electronic intruders. Comodo uses an incremental scanning system that marks files and folder that have been deemed safe. This makes for much faster average scan times. In addition, you have the option to create a fully customizable list of safe software and files, which can further reducing the average scan time. Updates are released daily that help keep Comodo&#39;s antivirus capabilities at the very top of their game. Most of the features mentioned previously can be modified in accordance with your preferences. Finally, operating the user interface is quite easy, even for novice computer users.","The number of alerts and notifications that Comodo Antivirus initially gives you can be a minor annoyance. Any suspicious or strange behavior on your computer system will be the subject of a security alert. Comodo&#39;s firewall is one of the primary culprits generating all of these alerts. Over time, the number of alerts grows smaller as the antivirus software learns which software and internet connections are most often used by the computer.","Comodo Antivirus s effect on a system&#39;s performance is notably minimal. Minor hiccups may occur while opening large files, but it happens only rarely. Comodo&#39;s detection rate is excellent, especially when compared to the minimal effect on the system&#39;s performance while the software is running.","Comodo Antivirus is one of the most feature-packed antivirus applications available. Some paid, professional antivirus software packs have fewer options and utilities than Comodo. Set and forget antivirus software is simply a must-have for every computer in order to keep it safe from unwanted intrusions. The newest version of Comodo Antivirus uses a cloud-based method of scanning for viruses and worms, and provides in-depth analysis of files that are not recognizable.","At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Don t Have To. "]},"id":"40e81a34-ad0d-4594-87b0-cc1522160903","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_5657","url":"/comodo-antivirus-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"thomas-reynolds","url":"/author/thomas-reynolds","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Thomas Reynolds","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"AymTE9mL6hPDppuojPk3bm","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-03-28T20:38:57Z","datePublished":"2011-03-28T20:38:57Z","name":"Comodo Antivirus Review","synopsis":"There is simply nothing better than free antivirus software, and with so many available, it can be hard to make a decision.","review":{},"strapline":"There is simply nothing better than free antivirus software, and with so many available, it can be hard to make a decision.","language":"en","dateModified":"2011-03-28T20:41:28Z","id":"2V8vuRi8HSph3PoNbQLjkF","meta":{"title":"Comodo Antivirus Review","description":"An in-depth analysis of Comodo Antivirus and its features."},"products":[],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:56:22Z","type":"feature","template":"standard","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/5833zkn5CPpmYGxuVEfyyE.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:56:22Z","mimeType":"","name":"5657-comodo-antivirus-review.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5657-comodo-antivirus-review.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:56:22Z","id":"5833zkn5CPpmYGxuVEfyyE","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5833zkn5CPpmYGxuVEfyyE.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Comodo Antivirus Review","description":"An in-depth analysis of Comodo Antivirus and its features."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/5833zkn5CPpmYGxuVEfyyE.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:56:22Z","mimeType":"","name":"5657-comodo-antivirus-review.jpg","importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/articles/5657-comodo-antivirus-review.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:56:22Z","id":"5833zkn5CPpmYGxuVEfyyE","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5833zkn5CPpmYGxuVEfyyE.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Comodo Antivirus Review","description":"An in-depth analysis of Comodo Antivirus and its features."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/software/articles/comodo-antivirus-review/","label":"","tags":[]}
