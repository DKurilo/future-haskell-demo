If lying in bed feels like you re on a piece of wood, you might need a pillow top mattress. If you spend the night tossing and turning only to wake up with countless aches and pains, you probably need a pillow top mattress. Pillow top mattresses are the solution to solving the pains of a regular spring mattress, utilizing multiple layers of foam and pillow cushioning to give you that unmatched level of comfort needed to fall asleep and stay asleep. Three pillow top mattresses available are the <a href=\"/best-mattress\">Serta iSeries Ceremony</a>, <a href=\"/best-mattress\">Sleeping Beauty</a> and the <a href=\"/best-mattress\">Birchmere Plush Euro</a>.","<strong>Pillow Top Mattresses: What to Look For</strong>","The best mattress is one suited to your body s needs, and only you can determine that. Even the best mattress reviews and clinical studies will tell you how personalized mattress comfort is. If you have back or neck pain, you might prefer a healthy medium between firm and soft. However, do your own primary research to find your optimal firmness level. Ask a doctor if necessary. And by all means, go to a mattress store to try out many mattress types. Pillow top mattresses offer many sleepers the perfect amount of firm support and soft body contouring, so be sure to try them out. As you examine these mattresses, keep in mind the following attributes.","<strong>Firmness</strong><br/>A pillow top bed contains an added layer of cushioning foam atop a traditional spring mattress. The density of the foam contributes to the mattress s level of firmness, allowing even a pillow top to become quite firm. At the same time, the key selling point of a pillow top is how soft it can become. A soft top layer effectively alleviates pressure points and relieves the causes of pain that most often awake you from sleep.","<strong>Materials</strong><br/>There&#39;s more to a mattress than springs. A quality pillow top mattress has high-grade memory foam that&#39;s odorless, layered for comfort and durable enough to go decades without losing its shape. The best mattresses also have springs   or spring alternatives   that isolate movement and hold their form long after the warranty expires. The mattress frame and surrounding tacking should also be high quality as well as pleasing to the eye.","<strong>Size</strong><br/>Most people change positions while in bed at night, and a bed that proves too small will keep you from moving freely in your sleep. The standard dimensions of a mattress range from the king at 76 x 80 inches and the queen at 60 x 80 inches to the full at 53 x 75 inches and the twin at 38 x 75 inches. A king size pillow top mattress obviously offers the most room to stretch out, but since it also costs the most, other sizes are also smart considerations.","<strong>Warranty</strong><br/>A common issue faced by owners of pillow top mattresses is a gradual indentation or the loss of foam integrity. The presence of a dip in the mattress can become quite apparent and detract from a pleasant night s rest, which means you need a warranty that will protect against common and uncommon problems alike. And not just any warranty, a warranty that will protect it for years to come. Beds are significant investments, and as such they should be guaranteed to last.","The pillow top mattress continues to prove popular due to the soft yet supportive surface it presents sleepers. After spending the night on one big pillow, you ll never want to go back to spring top mattresses."]},"id":"9929df15-68d1-4994-ba97-098ccae84108","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"aafc054c-be99-4561-9167-78d61cb44392","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.costco.com/Birchmere-Plush-Euro-Pillowtop-Queen-Mattress-Set.product.100004296.html\">Birchmere Plush Euro Queen</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LQ1RPG/?&tag=ttr_pillow-top-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1102[art|NA[pid|57280[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Dorel Signature Mattress</a>","<a href=\"http://www.us-mattress.com/sealy-pp-gel-series-kitchener-pl-ept.html\">Posturepedic Gel Series</a>","<a href=\"http://goto.target.com/c/13013/81938/2092?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsealy-posturepedic-hames-valley-plush-euro-pillowtop-mattress-set%2F-%2FA-50194931%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26CPNG%3DPLA_Furniture%252BShopping%26adgroup%3DInnerspring%2BMattress_SC%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9029826%26gclid%3DCM7umpSFlssCFZOCfgod3_QPgg%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds\">Posturepedic Harbor Valley</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007UQWYNI/?&tag=ttr_pillow-top-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1102[art|NA[pid|57283[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Serta iSeries Ceremony</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X6SHNBM/?&tag=ttr_pillow-top-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1102[art|NA[pid|57285[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Simmons Beautyrest</a>","<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7243375-11934115-1412021621000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.1800mattress.com%2Fsleeping-beauty-sleeping-beauty-advantage-pillow-top-mattress%2F800-KD26865%252F0LPS.html&cjsku=800-KD26865%2F0LPS\">Sleeping Beauty</a>","<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Slumber-Dream-Pillow-Mattress-King/dp/B01MEGH47G//?tag=ttr_pillow-top-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1102[art|NA[pid|57282[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Slumber 1</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188ARYM/?&tag=ttr_pillow-top-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1102[art|NA[pid|57276[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Textrade Full Inner Spring</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188CJ1G/?&tag=ttr_pillow-top-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1102[art|NA[pid|57281[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Textrade King Inner Spring</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"93b0a6f1-0ef5-4ffe-a8e9-3dd70da2573b","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1102","url":"/best-pillow-top-mattresses","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-06-17T17:29:14Z","datePublished":"2013-09-25T15:04:57Z","name":"Pillow Top Mattresses Review","synopsis":"A pillow top mattress ends those nights of tossing and turning and alleviates the back pain commonly associated with simple spring mattresses.","review":{},"strapline":"A pillow top mattress ends those nights of tossing and turning and alleviates the back pain commonly associated with simple spring mattresses.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-03-08T00:47:01Z","id":"VYb6bZgkFgU3KfxkAQF42o","meta":{"title":"The Best Pillow Top Mattresses - Top Ten Reviews","description":"Which is the best pillow top mattress for you?
