While it does not excel at producing even, enticing slices, it is a great budget option for a <a href=\"/best-meat-slicers\">food slicer</a>.","This slicer features a 150-watt gear-driven motor and a 7.5-inch serrated blade. Additionally, the removable blade is made of stainless steel, making it easy to keep sanitary. You can easily adjust the thickness of the slice when the machine is off or during a slicing session.","The FSOP-150 has a recessed power switch, set about an inch into the left side of the body. This is a good safety feature to see, as it reduces the likelihood of the unit being bumped and the switch accidentally turning the blade on. Additionally, it comes with a plastic food pusher, which acts as a barrier between your hand and the blade. Small spikes maintain traction and pressure with whatever food you are slicing so it doesn&#39;t slip as it meets the blade.","It moved around on the countertop quite a bit when we tested it, which made it feel less safe to use than more stable slicers. Its lack of countertop stability also hurts its ability to make a clean slice, and it left jagged edges on most food types we sliced with it. To get more even slices that look attractive on a party platter, check out the <a href=\"/chef-s-choice-review\">Chef&#39;s Choice 610 by EdgeCraft</a>.","As we unboxed the slicer, it had a series of tough-to-peel plastic sticker coatings that we had to remove from the carriage; they may be difficult to remove if you have arthritis. During our testing, the machine sounded labored any time it was actively slicing. Despite these two issues, it is otherwise easy to use. It puts out about 62 dB of sound when the blade is running, making it one of the quieter units we reviewed.","It is extremely easy to clean, as you can tilt the carriage over a sink to rinse it off, and the blade only takes about a second to remove and another to reattach it. Weighing in at 12 pounds, it is fairly light, so it does not add any hassle to the cleaning process.","The slicer comes with a one-year manufacturer warranty, which gives you plenty of time to use the product while covered. If you ever have any questions about or problems with it, you can contact Chard&#39;s customer service representatives via email or telephone. The contact information can be found on its website."]},"id":"41bc5c7b-53ae-49ea-a496-161fb42e6689","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d9567140-1a25-4b52-8a39-73a9a55f0ec9","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Chard FSOP-150 meat slicer is a good option budget slicer for home use.
