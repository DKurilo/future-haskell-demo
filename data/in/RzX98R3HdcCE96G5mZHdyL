You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Bibble 5 Pro can simplify your photo organization with tools that help you group together similar photos. The interface has clearly labeled management and editing options. This <a href=\"/best-photo-manager-software\">photo management software</a> has multiple management tools that assist you in clearly distinguishing between pictures, making it easy to sort through thousands of images.","With Bibble 5 Pro, you can easily organize your photos with labels and tags. It only takes a couple seconds to rate your photos according to how much you like each one. Then add in keywords that remind you of the photo, such as ocean, blue, whale and mountains. Through Bibble, you can add color labels of red, gold, green, blue and fuchsia to your photos to help you find them quickly. You can tag your photos, rename files and access the metadata for your images.","You can sort your photos in Bibble 5 by file name, date, rating, label, tag, focal length, shutter speed, F-number, ISO, whether you used the flash or not, and more. You can even customize how Bibble 5 Pro sorts your photos so you can find exactly what you&#39;re looking for. The left side of the interface gives you a Directory View of your files. This directory shows the path so you can see exactly where each photo file is stored on your computer.","In addition to managing your files through Bibble, you can adjust your images. You can straighten the picture if your horizon is crooked, increase or decrease the exposure, adjust the white balance and change the hue. If you need to adjust the noise level in the photo, you can use Bibble 5 Pro&#39;s Noise Ninja. This photo management software is nondestructive, so you don&#39;t have to worry about losing your original work because it saves multiple versions of the same image.","While Bibble has multiple photo management options, it only has one sharing option – slideshows. This is a valuable feature; however, the software lacks many of the common sharing options. Other photo management software offers links to online galleries; social networking sites such as Facebook, Google+; Flickr; and printing options that enable you to create calendars, photo books and other specialty products. Instead of focusing on the electronic and online sharing options, Bibble 5 Pro&#39;s interest is in helping you print your photos.","Bibble 5 is good at converting RAW files. This photo management software uses a multi-threaded image processing engine. Be aware that the layers work differently on this software than the layers on Photoshop.","You can refer to the user manual, tutorials or FAQs if you have questions on how to use the photo management software. You can also participate in the user forums online. If you have technical questions, you can email Bibble Labs, Inc. However, the manufacturer doesn&#39;t offer a telephone number for technical support."]},"id":"5ef0b447-c9a9-4d89-b9ff-65e0f50483ce","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"585b2a6c-ec77-4eb1-aaab-ffa0c0bc9e8f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Bibble 5 Pro photo management software will assist you in creating an organizational system that allows you to quickly find the pictures you need when you need them.
