Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Purchasing a <a href=\"/best-tv-wall-mounts\">TV wall mount</a> may seem secondary to picking out the perfect flat-screen TV, but we think these elements go hand in hand. A solid TV wall mount means a safe and secure TV. The Planet 3 Tilting Wall Mount is one such product that will support and beautifully display your brand new TV.","The Planet 3 Tilting Wall Mount is one of the few mounts we&#39;ve reviewed that can tilt in multiple directions. You can adjust this wall mount up or down – 15 degrees each way – making it possible for a personalized viewing experience. When in a non-tilted position, the mount allows the TV to be fairly flush to the wall, with a profile of approximately 2 inches.","Its solid-steel construction feels sturdy and secure when during installation, and it can support a TV weighing up to 180 pounds and 37 to 63 inches at its widest point. Most flat-screen TVs within this range have standard VESA installation patterns on the back, and the Planet 3 Tilting Wall Mount can support VESA patterns of 100 x 100 up to 800 x 500.","Installing something as crucial to the safety of your TV as a wall mount can be a little scary. The last thing you want is the mount and TV to pull out of the wall. To ease your mind and aid in this somewhat difficult situation, Planet 3 includes a user manual with specific installation instructions. The company also supplies the mounting hardware you will need for most VESA patterns. This means you won&#39;t have to run to the hardware store and guess at which kind of mounting hardware you&#39;ll need.","As long as your TV is between 37 and 63 inches, weighing no more than 180 pounds, Planet 3 has supplied all of the appropriate hardware. A level is included with the wall mount, but you will need to have your own stud finder. User reviews also point to easy installation, with some users bragging that installation took them less than 20 minutes.","The rail design of the Planet 3 Tilting Wall Mount lends itself to being easily adjusted up, down and side to side. We especially appreciate the ability to move your mounted TV horizontally. This feature makes it possible for your TV to adjust to your room&#39;s setup over the years.","Another consumer-conscious feature is Planet 3&#39;s concern for the environment. All Planet 3&#39;s walls mounts and packaging are recyclable and environmentally friendly. With your purchase, Planet 3 will donate 1 percent of the purchase price to Creating a Healthy Planet.","We were unable to find Planet 3&#39;s direct contact information online – only that of third-party vendors like Wal-Mart and Amazon. Although your user manual will have a way to contact Planet 3, we wish there were ways to contact the company online. If you do purchase this wall mount through Amazon, Wal-Mart or some other third party, you can also fall back on their customer support. Additionally, a one-year manufacturer&#39;s warranty is included with the mount."]},"id":"175fadb5-df3a-48cc-a88b-a32e79632055","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"59a5b35b-a75d-43ba-af78-bcef68db7e6a","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the Planet 3 Tilting Wall Mount may not have the best warranty or the largest weight capacity, we think its 37- to 63-inch TV size range and 180-pound capacity are still pretty impressive.
