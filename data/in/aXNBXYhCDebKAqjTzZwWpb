This disorder is characterized by unequal vision stimulation and begins developing at a very early stage of childhood. With this disease, the eyes do not see in a synchronized way and the burden of vision falls specifically on just one eye. At some point, the brain shuts off the impaired eye and the individual only has vision in the other eye.","Amblyopia is a result of either an uncorrected refractive error or a result of some kind of trauma to the eye at a very young age. Some of the symptoms of this disorder are:"]},"id":"5eb9e699-165f-4c8c-810d-bfe769ffd164","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Eye strain","Headaches","Squinting","Loss of vision in one eye"],"type":"ul"},"id":"d8cb3f28-1919-431e-9d43-fb3a78f27d15","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Amblyopia is treatable when it is found early and seen by an optometrist. If this is not corrected by the time the children turns nine, it is very possible the brain will begin shutting down the vision acquired by the impaired eye. Also, the brain is learning and beginning to ignore this vision and once this happens, the brain cannot unlearn it. Treating Amblyopia before the age of nine is extremely critical.","<strong>Using Contact Lenses to Treat Amblyopia <br/></strong>Typically the method for treatment of Amblyopia is through vision therapy exercises, use of an eye-patch, surgery, and vision correction eyeglasses. These methods aren t also pretty or self-esteem building and they can turn out to be very expensive. Research and technology have come a long way and using contact lenses to treat Amblyopia is the easiest and best way, as well as most economical, in treating the symptoms of Amblyopia.","Treatment with contact lenses is very simple and straightforward. The vision impairment in the eye is corrected with the help of contact lenses, instead of using regular eyeglasses. The child is fitted with contact lenses in the eye with weak vision capabilities. While the vision is being corrected, the brain is learning to acquire a clearer picture of sight and continues to use that eye.","<strong>Benefits of Using Contact Lenses <br/></strong>Cosmetically, contact lenses are the best way to treat Amblyopia. This is because the treatment is invisible to the child s friends, teachers, and everyone else. This helps create a confidence in the child while they are being treated for the disorder. Using contact lenses are also better because you don t have to worry about doing exercises at home or making additional trips for therapy or doctor appointments. And the biggest benefit of all is that it s relatively cheaper.","<strong>What Contact Lenses Should You Buy<br/></strong>Treatment for Amblyopia begins with prosthetic contact lenses. These unique contact lenses are specifically made for correcting disfigurement of cornea and improve its appearance. Although the lenses are prosthetic, they are similar to regular contact lenses. But they can only be prescribed by an eye doctor as they are not available over the counter.","It is very important to get your child examined by an eye doctor if you have any concerns. Regular eye check-ups are vital for good eye health. Your eye doctor will be able to determine if you child has Amblyopia and get them fitted with the correct contact lens.","For more helpful contact lens articles, check out our Contact Lens Learning Center for a large selection of contact lens articles.
