It has a lightweight and portable design, registers a wide temperature range and is easy to use, making it a versatile and durable cooking aid.","Any food thermometer is only as good as the temperature readings it provides. In addition to a temperature range of -40 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (-40 to 230 degrees Celsius), it also has an accuracy range of plus or minus 1 degree. The manufacturer has advertised this thermometer will register temperatures within six seconds, though it took an average of 18 seconds to get a full temperature reading in our testing. However, this gap discrepancy is not unusual. The advertised initial response time  only registers a percentage of the actual temperature. Our testing measured how long it took to home in on an precise and accurate reading.","Temperature readings were somewhat difficult to view on this thermometer’s small LCD display, as each number is less than a half-inch tall. Additionally, there is no backlight. If you need better visibility in a meat thermometer, try the <a href=\"/best-meat-thermometers\">ThermoWorks Thermopop TX-3100</a>.","We found that its single button let us easily change between Fahrenheit and Celsius measurements. The same button is used to calibrate or deactivate the device. This digital meat thermometer activates quickly, and its auto-off feature cuts the power after 10 minutes if no change in temperature has occurred.","The Taylor Pro 9842 thermometer is a great tool for any kitchen or grill, and it comes at a very pocketbook-friendly cost. The display is not as easy to read as others, but otherwise this meat thermometer is easy to use. It takes some time to generate a temperature reading, but once a temperature is identified the device is among the most accurate models we tested. If you’re looking for a simple and straightforward meat thermometer, this device wastes no time on frill features and focuses on reliable temperature readings."]},"id":"a645846f-c778-43a5-aef1-bdd39b85dfb8","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58149","url":"/taylor-commercial-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"linda-thomson","url":"/author/linda-thomson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Linda Thomson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"SD7AJ8PTDFstvquABQDpsH","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-11-13T20:58:55Z","datePublished":"2013-11-13T20:58:55Z","name":"Taylor Pro 9842","synopsis":"The Taylor 9482 Commercial is an instant-read meat thermometer that does a fine job for all-around use in the kitchen, as our testing showed.
