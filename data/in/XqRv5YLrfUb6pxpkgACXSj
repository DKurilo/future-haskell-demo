There are no apps that will connect with a DVD player and stream it to your device over a Wi-Fi network, let alone one that syncs a DVD movie to your phone and allows you to carry it around in your pocket. With Aimersoft DVD Ripper, all you need to do is select the iPhone 4S option from the library of output profiles and click Start. Then the application rips the movie and converts it to the exact specifications of the iPhone 4S. When it’s done, you have a file that is perfectly tailored for your device. The same is true if you have a different kind of iPhone, iPad or any other iOS device.","This application also has output profiles that optimize rips for Android and BlackBerry phones as well as other mobile devices. The list of profiles is long when it comes to specific makes and models of devices, whether it be a Samsung, Nokia, Sony, HTC – the list goes on and on. The bottom line is that if you have a mainstream mobile device, there is a high likelihood that this application can rip a DVD into a format that is suited for your needs.","There are many other compatible devices, too. Most console gaming systems have large hard drives that are designed to hold large qualities of movies that can be played on demand without a physical disc. Aimersoft DVD Ripper can convert your DVDs for these systems; Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation all have profiles. Their mobile counterparts such as the PSP and Nintendo DS also have the ability to play movies and have profiles for DVD conversion.","If you want just a plain-Jane file, like an MOV, AVI or MP4, you can convert for these, too.

Aimersoft DVD Ripper has the ability to act as a DVD to MP3 converter. It also can convert the audio found on your disc to a number of other formats, including M4A, WMA, WAV, AC3, OGG and more. The quality of the converted sound is identical to the sound on the disc.","One of the things that this application cannot do is perform a straight rip of the DVD’s files and folders to your hard drive. In order to rip a video off a DVD, you must perform a conversion. You can perform what Aimersoft calls a “lossless DVD copy,” which extracts the VOB file but not the file structure of the disc. This is an odd omission, but it’s not uncommon for software in this category. If you need a progam that can do this more easily, consider <a href=\"/winx-dvd-ripper-platinum-review\">WinX DVD Ripper</a>.","This DVD ripper also allows you to perform basic edits on videos before you rip them.
