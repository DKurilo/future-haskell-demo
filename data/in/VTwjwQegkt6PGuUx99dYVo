At home, you have access to microwaves, stoves and other electricity that enables you to heat up a bottle quickly. However, if you are away from home, finding a way to warm up a cold bottle for a crying baby can be a challenge. One solution is travel bottle warmers. For parents and caregivers always on the go, portable bottle warmers that require minimal planning, such as the <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-travel-bottle-warmers/warmze-review/\">WarmZe</a>, <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-travel-bottle-warmers/iiamo-go-review/\">Iiamo Go</a> and <a href=\"/home/kitchen/best-travel-bottle-warmers/tommee-tippee-travel-bottle-warmer-review/\">Tommee Tippee</a>, can be lifesavers. To learn more, read our <a href=\"/home-and-garden\">articles on travel bottle warmers</a>.","<strong>Travel Bottle Warmers: What to Look For</strong>","Once you have a baby, leaving your home and going somewhere becomes more difficult and requires preplanning. However, with the right supplies in your diaper bag, you can leave the house for a lunch date or travel long distances with your baby. A portable bottle warmer in your bag enables you to leave the house at a moment&#39;s notice and still be able to warm your baby&#39;s milk. Look for a bottle warmer that is portable enough to fit in the diaper bag and easy to use when you are on the go. Equally important are the warmer&#39;s features that ensure the speed of the warm-up and the temperature of the milk is best for your baby.","<strong>Portability</strong><br/>In order for a baby bottle warmer to fit into your diaper bag, it needs to be portable and intended for use without electricity. The majority of travel bottle warmers are compact and use various technologies to heat up the bottle, including sleeves, gel packs and bottle inserts, and you even plug some of them into your car. Most of the bottle warmers are either small enough to be kept in a pocket of your diaper bag or come with a carry case. <br/>While portable bottle warmers are intended for use on the go, many of the products are not allowed by the Transportation Security Administration. If you plan to use one on an airplane, make sure you choose a portable bottle warmer that will not be confiscated by airport security.","<strong>Features</strong><br/>Different travel bottle warmers use different heating technology. As such, the bottle warmers differ in how long it takes to heat the bottle and how long the bottle stays warm. Most portable bottle warmers take somewhere from 15 to 30 minutes to heat a bottle. With some of the bottle warmers using chemical reactions to create heat, you may be wary of harmful substances being used to create the phenomenon. Ensure that the bottle warmer is free of BPA (Bisphenol A) and phthalate, an acid used most commonly in plastics.","Most travel bottle warmers are reusable. Thus, they require time to either sterilize or prepare the heating element. While you can use them anywhere, if you need to prepare the heating element, you need access to electricity or hot water. Bottle warmers that are insulated or come with an insulated case keep the bottle warm, or cold, for a longer period of time.","<strong>Ease of Use</strong><br/>Many bottle warmers require prior planning. Some require boiling water to reactivate the heating element or a car adapter to work. Several rely on a one-time-use heat source to warm the bottle and eliminate preparation time altogether; however, you will need to spend more money to replace the heat source. Ones that require minimal planning, are reusable and can be used with ease when you are trying to calm a hungry baby are the best bottle warmers.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>In case you have any questions or concerns about your bottle warmer, the companies&#39; websites offer support phone numbers, email addresses and links to their social media pages. Most of the companies have a FAQs page to address common questions customers have had with the products.","With babies, everything takes twice the time and requires planning on your part. Whether you are simply running errands or traveling across the country, a travel bottle warmer allows you to leave your home and feed your baby anywhere. While the bottle warmers still require some forethought, they offer you the freedom to be away from your home or electricity for an extended period of time."]},"id":"df9017f8-e108-49fe-ab8c-0be11f71fa6e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"96aa8315-79f4-41ed-9a22-c233974e8cf4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EDKD2JE/?&tag=ttr_travel-bottle-warmer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1023[art|NA[pid|55568[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">WarmZe</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004C1O1GC/?&tag=ttr_travel-bottle-warmer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1023[art|NA[pid|55569[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Iiamo Go</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I110D8/?&tag=ttr_travel-bottle-warmer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1023[art|NA[pid|55567[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature</a>","<a href=\"http://www.diapers.com/p/productname-229933\">Yoomi</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B0VT32/?&tag=ttr_travel-bottle-warmer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1023[art|NA[pid|55571[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">BambinOz</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00648KZ8O/?&tag=ttr_travel-bottle-warmer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1023[art|NA[pid|55572[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Make My Day Bottle Warmer</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006SFUD2G/?&tag=ttr_travel-bottle-warmer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1023[art|NA[pid|55574[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Munchkin Travel Bottle Warmer</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C6OL84/?&tag=ttr_travel-bottle-warmer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1023[art|NA[pid|55573[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Prince Lionheart On-the-Go Bottle Warmer</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005PK1D42/?&tag=ttr_travel-bottle-warmer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1023[art|NA[pid|55575[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Diono Warm &#39;n Go</a>","<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00858APM2/?&tag=ttr_travel-bottle-warmer-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|1023[art|NA[pid|55576[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">Dexbaby Automobile Bottle Warmer</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"faf31d94-26b9-46be-beb4-0ba9fed5c90a","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_1023","url":"/best-travel-bottle-warmers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeff-ropelato","url":"/author/jeff-ropelato","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeff Ropelato","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"ZFTp4R9MHcSeWJm9weTSoE","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2012-12-05T20:32:17Z","datePublished":"2013-01-03T18:38:35Z","name":"Travel Bottle Warmer Review","synopsis":"Whether you are flying or driving across country or just running errands, a travel bottle warmer is useful for you as a parent.
