The Nest x Yale is an above-average smart lock, but unable to match the quality of Schlage and August.","The Nest x Yale costs $279 for a bundle that comes with a Nest Connect Wi-Fi adapter. Along with the <a href=\"/august-smart-lock-pro-review\">August Smart Lock Pro</a>, this is the most expensive smart lock we reviewed, over $100 more expensive than average.

First, the Nest x Yale lacks a keyhole, relying only on key codes and mobile app controls to open. This means no-one can pick the lock and must damage the lock to get it open, which triggers a siren.","Second, the Nest x Yale won&#39;t let you use common codes for the lock when adding them from the app. When we put in test codes of 1234 or 7777, it refused to accept them, prompting us to choose a more complex code.

That said, you need a Nest Connect or Nest Guard for this, as these are the only devices it can directly link to since the Nest x Yale uses Thread, a form of ZigBee developed by Nest.","Once it has Wi-Fi, the Nest x Yale works alongside other Nest products such as the <a href=\"/nest-review\">Nest Learning Thermostat</a>, <a href=\"/nest-cam-review\">Nest Cam</a> security camera and Nest Hello video doorbell. We had hoped that Nest x Yale would communicate directly with the Nest Hello as August&#39;s lock and doorbell do, but the integration isn&#39;t as seamless. Nest doesn&#39;t list any other <a href=\"https://workswith.nest.com/\">compatible smart home platforms</a> specifically for the lock, but we expect to see more over time.","While we found most smart locks easy to use, the Nest x Yale is one of the more user-friendly options available. It responds rapidly to commands from the mobile app and you can add guests quickly. You can have up to 20 codes for the lock which doesn&#39;t seem like very many, but it&#39;s enough for most homes.
