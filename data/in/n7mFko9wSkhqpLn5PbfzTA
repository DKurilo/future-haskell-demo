You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information. </em>","The Craftsman 37441 mower offers several features that make it fit to mow any lawn and make your yardwork that much easier. Our tests of this <a href=\"/best-gas-lawn-mowers\">gas lawn mower</a> yielded impressive results, showing it adjusts well to changes in direction and speed, which is essential for any yard. While it lacks some features that many of the top-rated lawn mowers have, this Craftsman lawn mower cuts grass quickly and effectively.","During the testing process, we looked at how the build of the lawn mower contributes to its overall performance. Even though this mower lacks an electrical start button, it&#39;s still easy to start, only requiring one pull on the string. It has a 21-inch blade that helps you mow the lawn at a fast rate. With the six different cutting positions, you can adjust where the blades lay and how high off the ground they rest. The mower allows you to adjust the blades between 1.25 and 3.75 inches from the ground.","The best part of this lawn mower&#39;s performance is the ease of direction. When we tested its ability to turn, it had no problems, and its performance quality did not decrease with changes in speed. The mower is much easier to control than the larger ones on our lineup, and with the variable front-wheel drive, you can maneuver it around the lawn quite easily. This maneuverability is particularly helpful since the mower does not have a cushion on the handle to protect your hands.","Compared to other lawn mower brands, this Craftsman runs quietly. We measured the noise level at 85 dB, which is the quietest of any of the lawn mower brands in our review. For contrast, the loudest mower we encountered is the <a href=\"/poulan-pro-review\">Poulan Pro</a> at nearly 100 dB. Not only does this mower cut grass without making much noise, but it also does not vibrate much when in use. High vibration would make it particularly uncomfortable to hold, especially given the uncushioned handles.","While this mower has the engine power to mow your lawn quickly, the small bag capacity requires you to empty it often. The manufacturer lists the bag capacity at only 1.9 bushels. Additionally, we found that a significant amount of dust escapes the bag as you mow.","This mower includes several convenient features to help you maintain it. It has a quick wash port you can connect to your hose to quickly rinse the debris out from underneath the mower. It also features Just Check and Add technology, which saves you time and eliminates the need to drain or change oil. You simply add oil when it indicates you should. Another convenient feature of this mower is its catching options. You can mulch, or use the side discharge or bag to collect the cut grass.","Craftsman backs this lawn mower with a two-year warranty and offers good customer support options on its website. You can contact customer service representatives by phone or email. There is an online copy of the mower&#39;s manual on the website, as well as a service center locator."]},"id":"98ec4d87-799b-425b-bb3e-92da0dc29882","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"077e081a-a13a-444b-82d5-5f302620e84f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["All of the Craftsman 37441&#39;s features perform well, and it has a strong design and ease of use.
