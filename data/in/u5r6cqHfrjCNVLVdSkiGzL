You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Pigeon Tyke is a user-friendly frame that makes it easy for lots of people to share photos on the same frame, even if they are many time zones away. This <a href=\"/best-digital-photo-frames\">digital photo frame</a> is tailor made for a grandparent that lives far away. They do not have to subscribe to any social media sites to enjoy a steady stream of new photos from their family that may be far away. As soon as family members download the Pigeon app, they just have to tap on it when they take a photo they want to share and it will appear on the frame. If you want something that makes greater use of technology and presents more versatility, try the <a href=\"/pix-star-review\">Pix-Star Foto Connect</a>. <a href=\"/pix-star-review\"><br/></a>","This digital picture frame is easy to use in other ways too. When we were testing for our digital photo frame reviews this one was out of the box and ready to use in minutes. Once you enter the password for your wireless internet you can use the frame.","Photo quality is not the most impressive with the Pigeon Tyke. All of our test photos looked dim. The whites looked sort of gray and the image generally was degraded unless you were looking at it straight-on from fairly nearby. That&#39;s a definite drawback since one reason you get a digital frame is to create a nice display that can be viewed by lots of people. Crowding around the Pigeon Tyke to really see a photo will be almost as bad as crowding around your phone&#39;s screen.","The Tyke acts more like a traditional frame than most Wi-Fi digital frames because it will display the same photo for a very long period of time if you set it to do so. You can have it display the same photo for 120 hours at a time if you like, or much shorter intervals. Most competitors don&#39;t allow you that much flexibility with display times.","The Pigeon Tyke should be relatively easy on your energy bill. A motion sensor means that you can leave it plugged in without having it run all of the time. It will exhibit its photos only when it detects motion in the room. It comes equipped to hang on the wall or to be set on a table."]},"id":"ce453adb-76b9-43ff-8bc2-5d25f04ee3bc","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"225ebaf4-c0a5-41bb-be61-ed9f84e40fc3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Pigeon Tyke is not the best at reproducing photos faithfully, but they still looked OK in our tests, and this frame is unbeatable for ease of use.
