This kind of danger mostly affects the elderly, but people of any age with certain disabilities can also be susceptible to this danger. Here are a few tips you can take that can help prevent a potential fall.","1.\t<strong>See your doctor</strong>   If you believe that a fall would seriously incapacitate you, make an appointment with your physician immediately. Discussing your concerns with your doctor is probably the most vital preventative step you can take to avoid a potential emergency. Your doctor knows your specific medical needs better than any person other than yourself, so your doctor can make solid recommendations and write prescriptions for medication that could help lessen your risk.","2.\t<strong>Stay active</strong>   Inactivity contributes to a great deal of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis and more. If you are as physically active as possible, you will drastically reduce the likelihood that you&#39;ll end up in a situation where you cannot bounce back after a nasty fall.","3.\t<strong>Get your vision checked</strong>   Sometimes falls are caused because someone simply couldn&#39;t see what is in front of them. If you wear corrective lenses or contacts, make sure your prescription is up to date. If you&#39;ve never worn glasses, be sure to see an ophthalmologist from time to time, especially if you think your eyesight is getting worse.","4.\t<strong>Equip your home</strong>   If you suffer from a condition that makes you more vulnerable to unexpected falls, you should install some simple safety devices around your home. Equipment such as grab bars and railings in trouble spots like stairs and in the bathroom can go a long way toward helping you from hitting the ground if you lose your balance.","5.\t<strong>Take your vitamins</strong>   This may sound like something parents tell their children. It is, though, because it&#39;s such a great piece of advice. Adults, like children, often don&#39;t get the vitamins and minerals they need to live a fully healthy lifestyle. Taking daily supplements can help prevent health conditions that would make you more vulnerable to falls or make a simple fall more likely to become a life-threating event.","6.\t<strong>Maintain your home</strong>   Homes are where most falls take place, so take care that you remove any potential dangers that may be in your path. Simple chores such as keeping your driveway free of ice and snow and keeping a supply of light bulbs on hand so that your house is always illuminated can go a long way toward keeping you on your feet and not lying on the floor.","These are just a few simple things you can do to reduce the likelihood that you&#39;ll experience a potentially catastrophic fall. While no precautions can protect against all possible accidents, taking steps to reduce the risk of a fall is always a good idea."]},"id":"7714904f-ac2b-4e40-86be-7cb11c130878","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_8009","url":"/how-to-avoid-a-fall","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"danny-chadwick","url":"/author/danny-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Danny Chadwick","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"DhF8Hg8QQde8MtLyq8X8JN","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-08-02T17:50:02Z","datePublished":"2013-08-02T17:50:02Z","name":"How to Avoid a Fall","synopsis":"One of the most compelling reasons to employ a medical alert system is the fact that you may fall and be unable to rise to your feet again.","review":{},"strapline":"One of the most compelling reasons to employ a medical alert system is the fact that you may fall and be unable to rise to your feet again.","language":"en","dateModified":"2014-08-13T21:03:46Z","id":"V2FpewejVjkkeC3co9V8qk","meta":{"title":"How to Avoid a Fall","description":"Falling and not being able to get back up can be a life-threatening event.
