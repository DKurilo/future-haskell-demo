It produces more racing wheels than just about any other manufacturer. The T80 Racing Wheel is one of Thrustmaster&#39;s latest additions. Made to work with the PS4, PS3 and PC, the T80 has several useful features, decent design and excellent customization options. There are a few things missing that hold the T80 back a bit, like a floor grip on the pedals and a stick shift. However, by and large, the T80 is a solid gaming steering wheel.","You have access to a total of 13 buttons, some of which you can reprogram to suit your needs for different games. The T80 is the only PC steering wheel on our lineup that has a wheel rotation of 1,080 degrees. Most high-end racing wheels only go to 900 degrees, giving you 2.5 rotations â€“ just like a real car. However, the T80 goes even further, which gives you more control options in your games. You don&#39;t have to use all 1,080 degrees if you don&#39;t want to, as you can adjust the steering sensitivity.","We were disappointed to see that there isn&#39;t even an option to include a stick shift. Instead, you have to rely on two paddle shifters located on the back of the wheel. While this is not a major issue, the whole point of racing wheels is to immerse yourself in your games. There simply aren&#39;t any real cars that have paddle shifters on the wheel instead of a stick shift, and that hurts the immersion somewhat.","The T80 steering wheel is 11 inches in diameter, which is a good size. It gives your hands plenty of room. The wheel setup is very light, which could be cause for concern. You don&#39;t want the pedals or the wheel to move around much while you&#39;re racing down tight roads. The best PC steering wheels are somewhat hefty to prevent them from sliding around."]},"id":"11e3cef9-44cc-44b3-8361-9e99347ab118","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d21e33e3-b48c-460b-96f6-83d804dc516e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Thrustmaster T80 Racing Wheel is a solid set that can give you more control of your racing games.
