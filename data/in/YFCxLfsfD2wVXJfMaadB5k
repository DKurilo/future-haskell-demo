This amplified HDTV antenna searches for TV signal in a wide radius and pulls in many channels, whether you are in a suburban area or a city.","Our signal testing was done in two locations: in our office building downtown and in an apartment a few miles south. Our office building has taller buildings and trees surrounding the building. These obstructions cause disrupted TV signal. The fact that we tested these HDTV antennas on the bottom floor of our buildings makes the surrounding buildings more of an issue.","With the Terk indoor HDTV antenna, we were able to receive 26 total channels in our office. This was the second most only behind the best HDTV antenna in our comparison. The antenna is amplified and boasts a strong search radius of 50 miles like the <a href=\"/1byone-review\">1byone Amplified</a> HDTV antenna.","This HD digital antenna received ABC and PBS, but we missed out on CBS and NBC. Both ABC and PBS had continuous light breakup, which was a bit annoying, but it was still watchable. It also picked up a bunch of local channels and subchannels that came through with mild breakup.","At our second location – the second-floor apartment – there is an empty field beyond the building, so there are no immediate obstacles to block TV signal. Here, we were able to pick up 30 channels. This is more than at our office, and it&#39;s in the upper range for our comparison overall. We received the major channels with HD quality streaming, although PBS had its share of interference.","Even though it didn’t pick up many more channels in a more suburbanized area, the reception was much better. People in those areas will most likely have the best luck with this antenna. Keep in mind the number of channels you receive will vary based on your location.","The Terk antenna is made of hard plastic. It doesn’t resemble the paper-like, flimsy antennas that many manufacturers produce. This digital HD antenna has a stand that props the antenna up so it can stand alone on a table top. It can also be mounted to a wall. Like the <a href=\"/amazonbasics-review\">AmazonBasics Ultra Thin Indoor,</a> the coaxial cable is 10 feet long, which gives you a good amount of leeway to find a good spot for reception in your home, something you’ll need to do when installing your receiver.","The Terk HDTV antenna is covered by a standard one-year warranty. If you have any questions or concerns about the Terk antenna, you can contact customer support through phone or email."]},"id":"d84766de-0631-464c-bb15-fe664e07d4c6","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"59ef322a-74c4-4f6d-b80b-228df0bb2bd2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Terk HDTV antenna performs a bit better in suburban areas than in a city, in our experience.
