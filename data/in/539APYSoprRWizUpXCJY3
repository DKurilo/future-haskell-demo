This digital thermostat may not have most of the energy-management features you will find on other thermostats, but it has multistage heating and up to four programmable periods per day.","The TX9600TS thermostat works on two-stage heating but only one stage of cooling. This isn&#39;t a problem, since the majority of air conditioning units on the market are only single-stage units. Single-stage cooling means the unit only has one fan speed, instead of building up speed in increments, using less energy. You can program a whole-house fan with this thermostat to keep the air in your home well ventilated. The Lux TX9600TS has a temperature swing of .25 degrees, the smallest in our review, meaning that it maintains your home&#39;s target temperature better than any other unit.","Programming the TX9600TS is easy, and you can program each day of the week individually. There isn&#39;t a one-touch override button, so if you want to reset your schedule, you either have to reset the entire device or reprogram the days individually. However, the thermostat lets you go from automatic to manual mode, which is a temporary temperature override feature. There are also hold and vacation features for when you are away for more than a couple of days.","If you are familiar with touchscreen technology, you know small typeface can cause a headache. The TX9600TS has large numbers and letters so you donâ€™t need to squint when programming the unit. The thermostat&#39;s screen is also backlit for easy viewing at night. You can install this thermostat yourself using the installation manuals on the Lux website. This unit is the only product in our review that does not have Wi-Fi or home automation capability.","This home thermostat isn&#39;t feature-rich, but Lux makes up for this by offering a three-year warranty on the thermostat without even requiring registration. You can contact Lux support via email and telephone. Lux does not offer live-chat or forum services."]},"id":"70eec36b-0a0b-4e92-9bba-c692cbbe46f9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"929eb67c-010e-49c8-b6ff-6a80e8dc683f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["For extra features, such as Wi-Fi and humidity sensors, you might want to consider some of the higher-ranked smart thermostats, but the Lux TX9600TS is still a major upgrade if you manually control your thermostat.
