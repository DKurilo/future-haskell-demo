You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Among <a href=\"/best-prepaid-cell-phones\">prepaid cell phone services</a>, Page Plus is unique. It’s one of the few prepaid providers that operates on <a href=\"/verizon-wireless-review\">Verizon</a>’s network. That’s a big deal – Verizon’s coverage is universally recognized as the strongest and most reliable in America, and it charges accordingly. But many people&#39;s focus is on affordability, where Page Plus falls a bit short.","The best prepaid cell phone plans give you lots of value for your dollar. Page Plus has some decent options, but they would be better if there was a bit more data allocated at every tier or lower prices per tier. The higher cost is unsurprising, since Verizon is notoriously expensive.","Page Plus’s entry-level plan gives you 250 minutes, 250 texts and a measly 10MB of data for $12 per month (or $10 with autopay). The data allocation is almost uselessly small, but the plan is otherwise on par with what you can get for similar prices at other providers. Likewise, the $30 plan gives you unlimited texts and 1GB of data, plus 1,500 minutes of talk time each month. Again, that&#39;s almost on par with the competition, but the 1,500-minute restriction seems unnecessary when virtually every other provider gives you unlimited talk for the same price.","Page Plus’ $40 plan is actually pretty reasonable, with unlimited talk, texts and 3GB of high-speed data. Other companies like <a href=\"/metropcs-review\">MetroPCS</a> and <a href=\"/boost-mobile-review\">Boost Mobile</a> charge the same amount, but they don’t have Verizon’s network to back them up like Page Plus does. Things start going downhill after that: The $55 plan gives you unlimited talk, text and 8GB of data, but you can get unlimited data for less at other prepaid carriers. The $70 plan is an even poorer deal, serving up just 10GB of data – again, you can get truly unlimited prepaid smartphone plans for the same or less at several other providers.","With the best coverage among prepaid cell phone service but an uninspired lineup of plans, is Page Plus worthy of a recommendation? For us, the clincher comes down to service and support, and it’s here that things start to go off the rails.","Page Plus is owned and operated by TracFone Wireless, a prepaid phone company with notoriously poor customer service. We’ve investigated many of its brands over the years – Net10 Wireless, Page Plus Cellular, Straight Talk Wireless and others – and we’re always disappointed with what we find. Reps are rarely knowledgeable and always sales-focused, so conversations tend to devolve unless you get pushy. To be fair, we’ve had good experiences with TracFone’s reps too, but they’re the exception, not the rule."]},"id":"24ffd1c3-725e-46ef-8dff-c3402c6f8744","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c20b8e7e-4530-4f22-8fdc-52172f26ff24","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["If you’re looking at prepaid providers, you probably care about price more than anything else. From that perspective, Page Plus is nothing special – you can always get either identical or better deals elsewhere and will probably enjoy working with a friendlier customer service team along the way. The one big exception is Page Plus’ $40 3GB plan. It’s a standard price for a standard allocation, and if that fits your needs, you might as well take advantage of Verizon’s impressive coverage."]},"id":"48134514-ba2e-409d-a3eb-d221cfe7bcbc","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3167","url":"/page-plus-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-05-20T17:10:55Z","datePublished":"2009-05-20T17:10:55Z","name":"Page Plus Cellular","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it is no longer available.","review":{"rating":80,"verdict":"The allure of the best coverage in the country can be strong, but Page Plus struggles to back up that coverage with compelling prices or service.
