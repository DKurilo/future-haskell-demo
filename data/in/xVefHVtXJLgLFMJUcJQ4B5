This is also a secure way to send and receive signed documents. A signed fax is a legally binding document, making fax technology very important to the legal, medical, real estate, government and economic sectors.","<strong>2. It&#39;s More Secure Than Email or Print Fax</strong>","A fax sent over the Internet is safer than email because it can&#39;t be stolen by email hackers on either the sending or receiving end of the communication.

When you use online fax, a printed copy of your online document is securely delivered to them immediately without your having to take the time to stop by your local copy place to use their fax machine.","<strong>4. It&#39;s More Personal Than Email</strong>","Every business in Japan still uses fax. There&#39;s something Japanese businesses find impersonal about email and online forms that keeps them from making the transition to email. That, combined with being able to create customized faxes with guaranteed security, makes faxing a continued hit overseas. Filling out forms by hand and faxing them online gives us all a break from our constant typing and digital lifestyles. It can even make your form stand out from the crowd if you are submitting an application.","<strong>5. It&#39;s the Only Way to Send Documents to Some Companies and Institutions</strong>","Many businesses still either use fax machines or fax over the internet to share sensitive or custom documents with their partners and clients. To work with these businesses, which include some government institutions, schools, and medical facilities, you will need to either invest in a fax machine, which requires expensive maintenance and electricity, or send faxes over the internet, which can be free in some cases.","Now that you&#39;ve learned some important reasons to try online fax services, all that&#39;s left to do is learn how to fax over the internet. Start by downloading well-reviewed online fax software. Set up an account, upload documents to your computer using a scanner or camera, and you&#39;re ready to fax.
