One of its greatest strengths is the ability to record your speech and analyze phonemes, and then model the movement of your tongue and compare it to that of a native English speaker, to foster better pronunciation.","In addition to the mouth diagrams that can model each letter you pronounce to show tongue positions when speaking, there are audio-wave charts that show your pronunciation as a line graph, compared to that of a native speaker. This tool makes learning English effective because it produces a chart of pronunciation and charts of your voice pitch, timing and loudness. You can practice until your tongue movement and voice charts match those of native English speakers.","This ESL application offers an online user interface that is clean, modern and easy to use. There is no need to read lengthy instructions. Just log in and begin learning.","EyeSpeak English offers lessons on all the fundamentals of English speech, including basic English grammar, conversations, education and learning, business communication and job interviews, airlines and hotels.","It teaches through practice exercises, games and listening comprehension. The English listening exercises focus on improving your speech, teaching you about words that sound alike, and word practice. There&#39;s a dictionary through which you access the tongue-modeling tool. You can adjust the speed of the modeling and corresponding audio.","Games include Save the Castle, Escape the Shark and Spell it Right. You must choose the right words to extinguish a castle fire in Save the Castle, find missing words to call a ship to rescue a person or the person gets eaten by a shark in Escape the Shark, and in Spell it Right, you listen to words and spell them correctly to turn monsters into helpers to build a tower. These games are simple but effective in reinforcing vocabulary and language through repetition. This ESL application does not offer crossword puzzles or flash cards.","EyeSpeak instructs only in English. In that sense, it&#39;s a virtual-immersion environment, but there are no cues or translations in your native language.","Basic English grammar offered in the application includes exercises on tenses, contractions, questions, verbs, negative sentences, singular and plural usages.","EyeSpeak English does not offer videos, CDs or books in its instruction. It lacks a glossary, personalized learning paths, and word and root search.","This English application offers full help and support, including FAQs, email, telephone and live chat. The company is based in New Zealand. We received replies to our several email queries within 24 hours."]},"id":"5d56d156-12ec-4f1e-934f-5e5bd76917c7","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"082f8159-141a-47ad-96d5-65ca8f1ecbbf","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["EyeSpeak English&#39;s unique feature is its tool that models your tongue movement when you speak, and then lets you compare it to the movement of native English speakers&#39; tongues.
