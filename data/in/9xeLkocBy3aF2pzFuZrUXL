While those are active, real-time trackers that can send you location updates by text or email, the iTrail is a historical tracker, giving you a history log of where the unit has been. You can use it to see where your child or teen driver has been at any point throughout the day, and what speed they were traveling. It collects accurate data, so we can recommend it if you are okay with using a tracker that doesn&#39;t receive real-time location updates.","The iTrail’s features include a waterproof casing, a data logger, a rechargeable long-life battery and a sleep function to preserve battery life. The built-in motion detector will wake the device when you&#39;re ready to use it again. You can export the data to a variety of formats, including Excel (CSV), Word, PDF, HTML, Google Earth and more. It can also store up to a staggering 120 hours of travel data.","To use the iTrail passive GPS tracker, once you’ve installed the drivers and software to set up and activate the device, turn it on and you’re set. If it’s been off for longer than four hours, give it about 40-60 seconds for the GPS to sync. You then attach it to your child’s backpack or bike, or the dashboard of your teen driver’s car. As they travel throughout the day, to school, a friend’s house, the mall, the iTrail will be logging their travel history.","When they arrive back home, you simply attach this passive GPS tracker to your Windows PC via USB, and use the software to see on a map where the unit has traveled, the time and date of each new position reported, and the speed it was traveling. You can create a report and view in Excel, Word, and more, or see it in Google Earth, which is an excellent mapping software app.","This small unit is easy to set up and use, but you need to install the driver first on your Windows PC before you connect the iTrail via USB to your computer. Once you’ve properly set the passive GPS tracker up, it’s easy to see where the unit has been.","SleuthGear, the team behind iTrail, offers several help and support options, including a user manual, updated drivers and software on their site, an excellent FAQs page and an extensive and easy-to-follow written tutorial on setting up and using this passive GPS tracker. If you need further help or technical support, you can reach the company directly by email."]},"id":"121246aa-ee2f-4f91-b187-ee404d408e53","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"b2e5de23-d729-417a-99de-3d6d25483ed4","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While it’s not an active, real-time GPS tracker, the iTrail still functions well as a historical geographic and speed logger, giving accurate results where your child or teen driver has been traveling.
