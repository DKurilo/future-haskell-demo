Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Netgear AC750 Wi-Fi booster is extremely effective at evenly distributing Wi-Fi throughout your home to your many devices. The feature that sets this Wi-Fi extender apart from most others is it supports 802.11ac Wi-Fi devices, thus upgrading your router if it doesn’t currently have that capability. With the dual band capabilities the 11ac technology will speed up your internet service even more than the average booster.","The AC750 is very compact and plugs right into the wall without a cord. It is a breeze to install and is equally easy to use. It’s the perfect booster for people with kids who use a lot of bandwidth with their many devices, because this booster’s dual band capabilities let you split the bandwidth and run signals on 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands simultaneously.","One unique feature of this Wi-Fi repeater is that LED arrows on the device tell you where to position the booster for optimum coverage. The trick in placing the booster is getting the right distance from the router without losing signal strength. The LED lights will save you time by avoiding the trial and error process of going too far or not far enough. The LED light will let you know your signal strength and make it easy to know where to place the device for optimal Wi-Fi coverage.","The AC750 also supports wired devices and functions as a basic access point. The Ethernet port lets you connect wired devices to your Wi-Fi network. It can operate in two Wi-Fi modes, extender mode to boost the existing Wi-Fi, or access point mode to create Wi-Fi access for 11ac devices, thus essentially upgrading a router that does not have 11ac technology.","Because of its compact size there is only room for one Ethernet port. If you need more than that you may want to consider the sister product, the Netgear AC1200, which has five Ethernet ports and a unique USB 3.0 port. This unit also lacks a USB connector.","Its dual band capabilities allow you to simultaneously access the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz Wi-Fi bands to avoid lags that can result from bandwidth congestion. Kids seem to use up more bandwidth with each succeeding generation, so having different options for directing bandwidth traffic could become increasingly important. This device will let you run off either band alone or both at the same time. The dual bandwidth capabilities combine for speeds of up to 750 Mbps, which means that lag time and glitches will fade away.","This booster has a distinct look to go along with its unique functionality. Its compact size and discreet, strategic placement capabilities will make this a nice fit for anyone who has limited desktop space. Setup is easy. The two external antennas are almost as big as the device itself, but the antennas also increase its speed and Wi-Fi coverage. As a package, the booster fits compactly onto your power outlet, taking up a little more space than the average night light.","Setup is easy and when you get it placed in optimal position, with the help of the LED arrows, you can virtually forget about it. The free app for Android devices lets you test and confirm that your Wi-Fi network is performing at top capacity in its current location or it will let you know if it could get better performance somewhere else.","Many of your questions after purchasing this product can be answered on Netgear’s generous and helpful FAQs page. This device has a one-year warranty, but technical support over the phone only lasts for 90 days. There is a live chat option, which you should be able to access anytime, but when we clicked on it, we weren’t able to connect. Help is also available via email, but you may have to wait for a couple days to get a response to your questions if you go that route."]},"id":"2c873030-4493-4114-a4da-68a17ae08eab","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"9742daf5-79d4-426f-be00-0162b86e4d74","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The sign of a good Wi-Fi booster is if you can forget it’s there.
