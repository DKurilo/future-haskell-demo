The chord voicing you use when playing the keyboard determines how the chord symbols are notated. For example, if you play an inverted D major chord, the chord is notated as D/F#.","If you are creating rehearsal scores for your band or choir and feel like you need to communicate more to the musicians, you can place virtual sticky notes throughout the score with helpful hints and tips.","The copy and paste functions are also powerful and easy to use. You can click the cursor anywhere in a measure to select all the notes in that measure, and then hold down the shift key and click anywhere in another measure to select all the notes in a series of measures. You can copy and paste the selected measures as many times as you want and then edit the copied measures however you want.","Sibelius First is a hefty program, weighing in at 500MB of hard disk space. The program takes up that kind of room because it is packed to the rafters with features to make your music composition experience as easy and fun as possible.","This software has a great full-sized virtual piano keyboard that is absolutely perfect for easy composition. All you need to do is click the keys on the virtual keyboard and the notes are automatically inserted into the score. Creating chords with the virtual piano is incredibly intuitive compared to any of the other virtual pianos we tried.","We like the mixer included with this notation program, which allows you to control the level of each voice in your score. The program also includes a nice MIDI-to-WAV conversion feature that lets you save your score as a digital audio file that can be burned to CD and shared with friends.","This music notation software includes the PhotoScore feature that lets you scan sheet music. The scanned music is then converted into transcribed notation in Sibelius First. This feature is useful if you want to transpose or edit an existing piece of music. The AudioScore feature lets you transcribe notes on a staff by playing an instrument into a microphone.","Avid has done a great job of giving you an impressive set of tools and features that will help you create professional-quality sheet music in an outstanding and affordable entry-level music notation software package.
