It&#39;s one of the most well-rounded trail cams we&#39;ve reviewed.","This game camera is motion-activated, and it stores its captured images and videos on an SD card. When you want to check it, you&#39;ll need to physically retrieve the SD card from the camera.","It has a 50-degree field of view, which is about average for a trail cam. While this field of view isn&#39;t quite as forgiving as the 55-degree field found on some of the best trail cameras, it still is sufficient for most hunters&#39; needs.","The camera detects movement using a passive infrared sensor with a detection angle of 50 degrees. It has a detection range of 60 feet, which means this is one of the most powerful detection circuits we reviewed. Its speed is also well above average. The camera has a trigger speed of 0.5 seconds, which means it takes a picture only 0.5 seconds after sensing movement. This is the second-fastest trigger speed among cameras we reviewed.","It also has an above-average recovery time. Recovery time is the amount of time it takes for the camera, after taking a picture or video, to be ready to trigger again. The G30&#39;s recovery time of five seconds ranks fourth in our lineup.","The camera has a bank of infrared LEDs that can illuminate subjects up to 80 feet away at night. Since many popular game animals are nocturnal, a powerful infrared flash is important for a game camera. This camera can also take time-lapse photos at set intervals. This can be one of the most useful features if you&#39;re going to scout a large field. Even if the animals are too far away to trip the detection circuit, you&#39;ll still have a chance to capture images of them.","Stealth Cam has friendly and knowledgeable customer service representatives. We were able to easily reach representatives without long hold times, and those representatives had a thorough knowledge of the Stealth Cam products."]},"id":"1694ac13-2cf6-43d3-b094-6ace9fa50549","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"c9701e00-3842-4457-b16a-2875eea2944f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Stealth Cam G30 falls just outside our top three, but it has no glaring weaknesses.
