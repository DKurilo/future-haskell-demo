It allows you to send and receive money with friends and family and to share notes and have conversations. Although secured with bank-level encryption and safeguards, you should use it for friend and family transactions only, not sales or business.","You can pay anyone instantly using money you have in your Venmo account, or you can link to a bank account or debit card. You can send money to people in the U.S. with a phone number or email, whether or not they have Venmo. They need to create a Venmo account to claim their payment, however. You can find friends automatically by syncing your Facebook or phone contacts.","Person-to-person transfers are free with Venmo in most cases. It does not charge if you transfer directly from your Venmo account or if your bank account is linked to Venmo. It does not charge for most debit card transfers. However, some debit card and credit card transactions incur a three percent fee when sending money. Receiving money is always free.","Venmo is one of the few peer-to-peer payment apps that contains a social component. In addition to recording and posting your transactions, it allows for comments and coordination. You can dictate whether a post goes to only you or your friends involved or if it is publicly posted for any Venmo member to see. Further, friends can comment on or like your post. This could be handy when coordinating an event, such as if you are collecting money for the tickets. You can tag your friends for their share and keep them appraised of meet-up times, locations or last-minute changes.","You can secure transactions by adding a PIN code to your app, which you need to input whenever making a transaction. If youâ€™ve lost your phone or suspect that it is being used in an unauthorized way, you can prevent it from accessing your Venmo account and revoking access from that device. Venmo uses bank-grade security systems and data encryption to protect you and to guard against any unauthorized access to your personal or financial information.","Venmo does not permit merchants to make sales via Venmo, nor does it offer buyer or seller protection. You should only use this P2P payment app with people you trust, and you should not use it for buying and selling of goods, such as on Craigslist.","Venmo is a good app for sending and receiving funds among family and friends. The mobile app is easy to use, and the social component makes it handy for organizing events. It shouldn&#39;t be used for business transactions, however."]},"id":"91fad8c9-ab17-4e9b-b074-78edf29d871d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67661","url":"/venmo-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-02-05T17:33:07Z","datePublished":"2016-02-05T17:33:07Z","name":"Venmo","synopsis":"Venmo is a popular person-to-person payment application for both Apple and Android systems.
