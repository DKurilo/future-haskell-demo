The original review is below, but check out our current top products about </em><a href=\"/best-hardwood-floor-vacuum-cleaners\"><em>Hardwood Floor Vacuum Cleaners</em></a><em> here.</em>","When you are looking for a hard floor vacuum, two of the most important factors to consider are ease of use and cleaning power. The Neato BotVac 75  robotic vacuum provides an ideal combination of those two factors.","While most robot vacuums are circular, the BotVac has a square front and a round back. The unique shape means that the vacuum can get deep into corners, saving you from having to do any additional vacuuming in those tight spaces. The BotVac also has edge-cleaning brushes, which spin along the sides of the robot vacuum to clean the space between the vacuum and the wall.","In addition to its unique shape, Neato Robotics also designed a patented vision system for the BotVac that uses lasers to scan a room and plot out the most efficient way to clean it. Some competing robot vacuums use mathematical algorithms to determine their cleaning path, which can lead to lot of noisy bumping back and forth throughout a room. The laser-guided planning means a Neato machine will clean a room in less time and with less noise than many of its competitors. The downside of this efficient approach is that the BotVac  rarely goes over the same spot twice, which can mean a less thoroughly cleaned floor if yours is especially dirty. This should concern you less if you plan on using the BotVac primarily as a bare floor vacuum, as it has sufficient cleaning power to clean hard surfaces in one pass.","Like most high-end robot vacuums, the BotVac has a stair-sensor so that it will not fall off a ledge while cleaning. It also comes with magnetic boundary strips that you can lay down around your house to mark no-vacuum zones. You control the device with a small on-board screen surrounded by several buttons, and you can command it to clean immediately or schedule a cleaning for a later time.","One of the most interesting features of the Neato BotVac is its recharge process. When it is in the middle of a job and senses that it is running out of battery power, it returns to its charging base for a recharge. When it finishes recharging, the vacuum returns to where it left off cleaning and completes the job.","The Neato BotVac&#39;s cleaning process is one of its best attributes. It boasts a brush, dustbin and filter that are all larger than most competing robot vacuums. The result is debris pick-up that, while not up to the standard of a comparably priced conventional vacuum, is more than adequate for a wood floor vacuum.","Robot vacuums make some of the best hardwood floor vacuum cleaners because of their automatic operation and steadily improving cleaning power. The more refined robot vacuums, such as the Neato BotVac 75, are ready and able to take on the task of cleaning your hardwood floors on their own."]},"id":"997dbfd0-89af-45c3-bafb-b87ca26e335f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_59428","url":"/neato-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-04-28T15:36:35Z","datePublished":"2014-04-28T15:36:35Z","name":"Neato BotVac 75","synopsis":"Editor's Note: This review has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it no longer ranks in our lineup.
