You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Black &amp; Decker 4-Slice Toaster Oven is one of the most energy-efficient ovens in our lineup, using only 1,150 watts when operating, which means it adds less to your electricity bill. Despite its small size, this <a href=\"/best-toaster-ovens\">toaster oven</a> still offers baking and broiling functions, though it does not have a defrost setting to thaw frozen food. You can set the temperature between 150 and 450 degrees.","When preheating the oven, we found that it heats up quickly; however, the accuracy of the temperature varies. When set at 350 degrees Fahrenheit, the toaster oven remained well below that temperature throughout the cooking process. Despite the varying temperature, all of the food cooked evenly.","This four-slice toaster oven is very compact, only weighing 7.5 pounds, so it&#39;s easy to move from storage to your countertop. It has one rack that you can adjust to fit whatever you are cooking. The design is more complicated than those of other toaster ovens we reviewed. The dial uses symbols instead of labels, which can be confusing until you learn what each one means. Also, without a display screen, it is difficult to tell what setting, temperature and time you have the unit on.","This black toaster oven lacks several safety features. Without an automatic rack ejector, you have to manually pull out your rack and food. It also has a high exterior temperature on top of the unit when cooking. We measured it at 225 degrees Fahrenheit. We also found that the handle becomes pretty warm as well, reaching 115 degrees. While this heat makes the toaster oven difficult to use, it does come with an automatic shut-off that turns off the toaster after the timer ends.","You can only set the timer for a maximum of 30 minutes, which can be restrictive. However, you can adjust the timer while you are cooking to increase its time. This small toaster oven comes with four cooking functions: toast, bake, broil and keep warm. With the adjustable rack, you can determine how close you want your food to be to the heating elements.","This compact toaster oven does not feature a nonstick interior. However, it&#39;s still fairly easy to clean using the appropriate cleaning supplies specified in the manual. In addition to the cooking rack, this toaster oven comes with a bake pan and a broiling rack. It is also covered for two years, which is a longer warranty than most of the other ovens in our lineup offer."]},"id":"f1e5d6c7-b686-4faa-94a6-384d8abc8724","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d09f3067-26d3-48d1-9803-4a99a1da942e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Black &amp; Decker 4-Slice Toaster Oven TO1303SB bakes, broils and heats food.
