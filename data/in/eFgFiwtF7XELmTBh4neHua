This company has a reputation for carrying cool glasses with modern designs, and it has an impressive initiative that provides glasses to underprivileged people around the world. Still, it is not the best online eyeglasses store for everyone. Warby Parker has great frames for men and women, but it doesn’t sell children’s frames. It also does not have as many lens options as other online glasses sites. The site is still worth checking out because its frame styles, shipping options and customer support are all exceptional.","This online eyewear provider only sells one name-brand frame line, Leith Clark, but its own frames are comparable in style and material. This is one of the best places to find trendy eyeglasses online, as it has a variety of frame styles, including retro, vintage, classic and aviator. The company doesn’t carry frames made specifically for sports, but it has a large selection of sunglasses. Warby Parker has full- and half-rim frames but not any rimless ones.","This online eyeglass store sells single-vision and bifocal prescription lenses. However, it cannot make glasses with trifocal or progressive lenses like <a href=\"/aclens-review\">AC Lens</a> or <a href=\"/eyeglasses-com-review\">Eyeglasses.com.</a> Warby Parker uses polycarbonate material to craft its lenses, making them thin and light, and it offers high-index lenses for stronger prescriptions. These lenses come with anti-scratch and anti-glare coatings and provide UV protection from the sun’s harmful rays. Both prescription and nonprescription sunglasses are polarized to reduce glare. You can also purchase photochromic lenses, which automatically darken in bright light, but the store doesn’t offer custom lens tints.","This online glasses company sends your completed glasses in about 10 to 12 business days when you order prescription lenses and five business days for nonprescription ones. Shipping is free in the contiguous U.S., and you can have the company expedite your order for an additional fee.","If you do not like frames you order, the company has a 30-day, no-questions-asked return policy. This is a great benefit for anyone new to this kind of shopping who might be apprehensive about buying prescriptions glasses online. Warby Parker’s glasses also have a one-year warranty, and the company will replace your glasses if scratches appear in that time.","One of the store’s best features is its home try-on program, a rare feature among online eyewear companies. Warby Parker can send you five pairs of frames of your choice for free. You get to try the frames out for five days before sending them back. You can also use a virtual try-on system to get an idea of how the frames will look on you. If you&#39;re still unsure what you want, the website will make recommendations for you based on your face shape and style preferences. ","This company has the best customer support in our review. Customer service representatives were friendly, helpful and attentive as they answered all our questions. You can reach the company by phone, email or live chat. The website is very easy to navigate as well. Warby Parker even has a FAQs section and an order guide to help you find the right frames to match your style."]},"id":"29b6d269-b840-48b4-a29d-676ab585aca0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"420dae4c-0f7f-4e5b-acb7-92f0a0b4f6a3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Warby Parker has some of the most stylish, trendy frames we saw.
