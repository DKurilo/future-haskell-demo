This programmable thermostat features a large, interactive touchscreen and customized programming for every day of the week. While it does resemble its big brother, the XL900, in design, the XL800 does lack features like a humidity sensor and has fewer cooling stages but makes up for it with easy programming and maintenance reminders.","The XL800 is perfect for those who want to program each day individually. You can manually set it up to run four schedules per day. There is also a copy feature, letting you copy one day&#39;s settings and paste them into another day. This is great considering it can take some time going between days when you are programming a thermostat.","The smart thermostat features a 10-inch screen that is easy to navigate and punch the buttons on the screen. You can override any current schedules that you have with one button as well as change it to manual functions just for the day. While it&#39;s easy to program, installing this digital thermostat requires a professional.","One feature that sets the XL800 apart from other thermostats is its ability to store everything to permanent memory. Whether it’s a schedule or programming features, you can go back months later and find old information, even if you deleted it.","This thermostat would rank higher if it had multi-stage heating and cooling. Unfortunately, it only works on single-stage heating and cooling. It does have armchair programming with a removable screen, which is a convenience we enjoy. The XL800 thermostat also displays outdoor temperature and has a vacation program feature that will hold the temperature for up to 256 days. And with minimum and maximum temperature settings, you can avoid constantly running the heater or air-conditioning unit, saving energy and money.","The XL800 comes with a registered 10-year warranty, limited to internal functional parts, with optional warranties coming from dealers. The site has extensive resources for you should you require help. There are installation videos, information on tax credits and even live chat. Although, the staff at Trane isn&#39;t trained to answer technical questions so you will need to seek out a dealer."]},"id":"dc691f4d-24e7-4d1b-ab39-f0d2627396b2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"037a5fef-a112-423f-a189-d342b0f5eec3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Trane XL800 is equipped to save you money and energy.
