It’s a good-looking product, and it comes with everything you need to install it, including the shower head, flexible metal hose, bracket, thread-seal tape and even a thank-you card. Overall, it’s a good <a href=\"/best-handheld-showerheads\">handheld shower head</a> with satisfying spray settings and enough color options to match every shower in your house.","One thing we found a bit suspicious is that the back of the installation instructions had a guide on how to remove the shower head’s flow regulator. This made us wonder if perhaps the shower head was designed to use larger amounts of water, and the included flow restrictor and instructions on how to remove it are a workaround. We feel like manufacturers should ship out products the way they’re meant to be used. The ShowerMaxx also does not have a WaterSense buying option, so you can’t buy it in some areas of the U.S.","Thankfully, we didn’t have to do any alterations to get the ShowerMaxx hand shower to work. We ran our tests with the shower head as received from the manufacturer, using 48psi (pounds per square inch) of water pressure, and found that the ShowerMaxx had a very average actual flow rate, at 1.5 gpm (gallons per minute). It performed well in our benchmark trials and with our testers, though we preferred the massage settings available with the <a href=\"/waterpik-review\">Waterpik PowerSpray+ Twin Turbo</a> and the rain settings on the <a href=\"/speakman-review\">Speakman Rio</a>.","It has six settings: rainfall, circular massage, power massage, rainfall with circular massage, rainfall with power massage and water-saving trickle. We found the rainfall setting to be less like rain and more like a normal, moderate-pressure spray, perfect for typical shower use and rinsing. The settings are decently distinct and have good pressure, though coverage can feel a bit lacking sometimes. You switch through these settings with a thumb lever at the base of the face.","This product had the most color choices of any shower head we considered and is available in chrome, brass, bronze and nickel, so there’s an option to match any bathroom. It also features self-cleaning silicone jet nozzles for easy upkeep. ShowerMaxx offers a lifetime warranty on its hand showers, and you can contact customer support via email or live chat on the company’s website."]},"id":"1ca51a2e-4edb-4eff-ae8c-1590f4733259","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_69733","url":"/showermaxx-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-02-16T15:12:32Z","datePublished":"2018-02-16T15:12:32Z","name":"ShowerMaxx Handheld Spa Head 6 Spray Settings","synopsis":"Right out of the box, the ShowerMaxx shower head made an overall good impression.","review":{"rating":82,"verdict":"The ShowerMaxx hand shower creates a relaxing shower experience with decent water pressure, coverage and spray settings.","pros":["There are four finish options, so it can match your existing bathroom fixtures."],"cons":["It is only available with a 2.5-gpm flow rate, so it doesn&#039;t meet regulations in some areas."]},"strapline":"Right out of the box, the ShowerMaxx shower head made an overall good impression.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-03-02T00:00:00Z","id":"kFR5H9wvo5xVTsrLDPtdWS","meta":{"title":"ShowerMaxx Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The ShowerMaxx hand shower creates a relaxing shower experience with decent water pressure, coverage and spray settings."},"products":[{"slug":"showermaxx-handheld-spa-head-6-spray-settings","url":"/product/showermaxx-handheld-spa-head-6-spray-settings","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:21Z","name":"ShowerMaxx Handheld Spa Head 6 Spray Settings","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:21Z","id":"UptYUNmjtzCtuXsfi4cNem","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T20:06:21Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/aGb8SuaRncvvbRntbR4nDC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:21Z","mimeType":"","name":"8f499ba0f15d11229783f7d97a8a98a2.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/8f499ba0f15d11229783f7d97a8a98a2.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:21Z","id":"aGb8SuaRncvvbRntbR4nDC","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aGb8SuaRncvvbRntbR4nDC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"ShowerMaxx Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The ShowerMaxx hand shower creates a relaxing shower experience with decent water pressure, coverage and spray settings."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/aGb8SuaRncvvbRntbR4nDC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:21Z","mimeType":"","name":"8f499ba0f15d11229783f7d97a8a98a2.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/8f499ba0f15d11229783f7d97a8a98a2.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:21Z","id":"aGb8SuaRncvvbRntbR4nDC","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aGb8SuaRncvvbRntbR4nDC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"ShowerMaxx Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"The ShowerMaxx hand shower creates a relaxing shower experience with decent water pressure, coverage and spray settings."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/health/wellness/best-handheld-showerheads/showermaxx-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"health-and-beauty","url":"/health-and-beauty","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:21Z","name":"Health & Beauty","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:21Z","id":"5johNE4w3ctxAug7oACGPh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"personal-care","url":"/health-and-beauty/personal-care","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T20:06:21Z","name":"Personal Care","dateModified":"2019-04-16T20:06:21Z","id":"N6Vr7FEXykAcbcKQHGXUJ","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
