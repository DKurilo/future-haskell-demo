Unless you scan them into a digital format, you risk losing all of your memories. The <a href=\"/best-photo-scanning-services\">photo scanning services</a> offered by ScanMyPhotos provide long-lasting backups for all of your photographs by scanning them into digital formats that are suitable for printing, framing or storing in a photo album.","ScanMyPhotos produces high-quality digital copies of your photographs in either 300 or 600 dots per inch (dpi) JPEG files. Once scanned, the service puts them on archival DVD that can last for up to 80 years if properly cared for. You need to make sure to store the DVD in a cool place, though, to keep it from warping and other damage.","If you have old photographic slides, you can have them scanned into digital copies with ScanMyPhotos&#39; scanning services. It has two types of services available, and the standard service doesn&#39;t include color adjustments. If your slides are faded and need color correction, you have to upgrade to the premium service.","Your old home videos can also degrade over time, no matter how well you take care of them or where you store them. ScanMyPhotos offers video transfer as part of its scanning services. This service lets you send in your VHS, VHS-C and Hi8 home video tapes to have them converted to a common DVD format that plays on most standard DVD players. The drawback, of course, is that you have to actually send your precious memories to the company for transfer and hope that they don&#39;t get damaged during the process or shipping.","Many old family photographs end up with scratches and fading over the years. ScanMyPhotos is able to restore those and provide long-lasting copies. A team of artists work on your photos to get rid of flaws like tears, fading and other types of damage. Be prepared to pay a premium for this service, though, as it takes time to perfect the photographs. The turnaround time for a single restoration project is 20 days, so expect to wait a while for this service, too.","If you have a number of family photographs, video tapes, slides or negatives, ScanMyPhotos is a possible choice for a photo scanning service. Keep in mind the costs and turnaround time, though."]},"id":"bbe91407-a43a-435a-894f-47407f9bfadb","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_64751","url":"/scanmyphotos-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-05-12T15:38:54Z","datePublished":"2015-05-12T15:38:54Z","name":"ScanMyPhotos","synopsis":"Regardless of how well you take care of your photographs, they eventually degrade and deteriorate over time.
