Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Philips Norelco 7300 <a href=\"/best-electric-razors\">electric razor</a> offers a lot of benefits that the best shavers do, and it has 50 minutes of cordless running time, which is longer than most. This unit includes a battery indicator, a precision trimmer and a quick-charge option. It has rotary shaving technology, which is the best kind of electric razor for men who have thick facial hair that grows in more than one direction.","During our shaving test, this rotary shaver didn’t provide a very smooth shave. There was some stubble left after shaving. It was most difficult to get all the hair under the chin, and the jaw line was also a problem area.","We also found that this electric shaver irritated the face a little at first, but it wasn&#39;t as bad after we got used to the razor. We had to shave at least four times over the same area in order to get a close shave. The <a href=\"/philips-norelco-review\">Philips Norelco 7700</a> is another rotary razor with DualPrecision heads that are designed to attack short stubble for a clean shave.","This Philips Norelco razor takes an hour to recharge from a dead battery, which is normal. It also offers a quick-charge option that allows you to plug it in for five minutes to get just enough power for a single shave.","This unit measures 7.2 inches long, 2.5 inches wide and 2.3 inches high, and it weighs 2 pounds. This is a bit heavier than most electric razors, but during our testing it felt normal to hold.","The razor comes with both a charging dock and a cleaning station. You can also clean the razor by just rinsing it under tap water. We found that it was easy to clean under tap water and only took 20 seconds to clean after shaving. You don&#39;t get any extra attachments, but that&#39;s normal for electric razors that aren&#39;t made to shave more than facial hair.","Philips backs the Norelco 7300 with a two-year warranty. This coverage is pretty standard for electric razors. You can contact Philips for help and support by phone or by live chat on its website. You can&#39;t, however, get support by email from Philips. It does offer a list of FAQs on its website, though."]},"id":"a840d95b-b54a-4f59-a124-64ec5d9ace39","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"2140ed40-fd18-4919-b748-aee65f31e3b6","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Philips Norelco 7300 isn&#39;t among the very best electric razors for men, but it is a great rotary razor, and it has a lot of benefits, including a cleaning station, charging dock, battery indicator and precision trimmer.
