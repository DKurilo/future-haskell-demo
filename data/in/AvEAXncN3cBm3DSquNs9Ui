Writing a check can take even longer – particularly if you have to send it through the mail. Most of the major U.S. banks offer <a href=\"/best-p2p-payments\">person-to-person (P2P) payment</a> transactions through their mobile apps or websites. Zelle is a company that facilitates these transfers for its member banks.","This peer-to-peer payments provider works through mobile banking apps from Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, First Bank, US Bank and Wells Fargo. However, you can still use the service for free even if you don&#39;t bank at one of these institutions by registering on Zelle&#39;s website.","Zelle doesn&#39;t do any of the actual transferring of funds but rather provides the information the member banks need in order to complete the transaction. For you, that means logging in to the mobile banking app or Zelle&#39;s website and providing the person&#39;s email address or mobile number and the amount of money you want to send. It&#39;s as easy as paying bills online and costs nothing. Your recipient needs to have an account at a U.S. bank, however, so it may not work if you want to send money to a friend or family member living outside the country.","If a friend or family member requests money from you, you get an email or text notification. If you don&#39;t have an account with a member bank, you can set up a Zelle profile to reply to the request and authorize or deny the payment.","Zelle (formerly ClearXchange) was founded by large, national banks, so the security protocols that this P2P payment service uses are bank-grade and match what the banks use. You are as secure transferring funds via this P2P payment site as you would be with your online banking service, since, in fact, your bank enacts the actual transfers. Zelle times out if you linger too long on the website – even if you&#39;re not logged in. This keeps you from accidentally leaving the site open with your account information left vulnerable.","Zelle makes P2P payment transfers easy and secure by facilitating them at a bank level. It&#39;s a good choice for people who don&#39;t want to deal with a separate account for P2P payments but who need to sometimes send or receive money from family or a friend."]},"id":"b8fb9085-6743-464d-af34-0e6f81c303f2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_67654","url":"/clearxchange-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-02-05T15:32:47Z","datePublished":"2016-02-05T15:32:47Z","name":"Zelle","synopsis":"Editor's Note: ClearXchange has changed its name to Zelle, so we have updated the company's name in our review.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor's Note: ClearXchange has changed its name to Zelle, so we have updated the company's name in our review.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-05-06T00:00:00Z","id":"AvEAXncN3cBm3DSquNs9Ui","meta":{"title":"ClearXchange P2P Payments Review - Pros and Cons","description":"ClearXchange allows customers of its member banks to send and receive person-to-person payments through online or mobile banking.
