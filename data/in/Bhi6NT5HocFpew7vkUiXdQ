The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-front-load-washers\"><em>Front-Load Washers</em></a><em> here.</em>","The GE Profile Series PFWS4600LWW front-loading washer has 11 wash cycles, eight options, five soil levels, and six wash and rinse temperatures. Additionally, this GE Profile Series front-load washer boasts a 4.3-cubic-foot washtub, which is a decent size that allows you to fit quite a bit of laundry into one load.","This front-load washer has the pleasure of baring the Energy Star label, but falls on the short end of energy costs and consumption compared to many of the washers on our lineup. It’s estimated that it will cost you $21 annually and consume 201-kilowatt hours every year. This is the highest amount of money and energy out of all the front-load washing machines we reviewed.","Along with its large capacity washtub that can help you do less loads of laundry, saving you energy, you also get an eWash option that is designed to save energy when used on specific wash cycles.","This GE front-load washer gives you fairly standard wash cycles along with a handful of specialty ones. The 11 wash cycles include: whites/heavy duty, colors/normal, wrinkle free, active wear, hand wash, delicates, speed wash, drain and spin, and a basket clean cycle. The specialty wash cycles include options for athletic shoes, fleece, fragile cottons, pet bedding, single-item wash and a handful more.","One of our favorite features on this front-loading washer is its overnight ready option, which allows you to do a small load of laundry in an eight-hour time frame that will be washed and dried without having to move the wash to an actual dryer. Additionally, this washer includes steam features that help to reduce wrinkles, remove stubborn stains and more.","GE provides an excellent warranty for this front-load washing machine. For the first year, the washer parts and any labor that may be necessary is covered. Additionally, GE provides an additional warranty to the appliance’s motor from year two to five, and the appliance’s washtub is covered for the lifetime of the product.","GE can be contacted for help and support by phone or email. However, if you want to get support via email, you first need to fill out an online contact form on the GE website for the manufacturer to contact you via email. GE also provides the product user manual, FAQs and product tutorials on its website for your reference."]},"id":"cdd729d5-22a8-4ed6-8676-10d27ecf21a1","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"adb8628f-4d66-48d2-ac4e-ee87480eadfd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GE Profile Series PFWS4600LWW front-load washer is both practical and advanced with the standard wash cycles and specialty cycles it includes.
