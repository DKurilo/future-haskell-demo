OneTouch Verio IQ is one of the most recognizable <a href=\"/best-glucometers\">glucometers</a> on the market. It has a number of unique and helpful features that can help you monitor fluctuations and subtle patterns in your blood glucose levels. While its test strips are available everywhere, they are also among the most expensive.","The Verio IQ received an A- in our accuracy tests because it had only a few readings that were outside of the acceptable range. In addition, the test strips never produced error readings and never failed. They require very little blood to take a reading.","To determine the accuracy grade, I ran multiple tests every day for three weeks. During each testing session, I used all 11 glucometers with the same blood sample. I then averaged the readings and created an acceptable range, with 15 percent above and below the average as the maximum and minimum. Any readings that fell outside this range were deemed as likely inaccurate. Over time, I collated the results and graded them accordingly.","Of course, it&#39;s important to note that these tests weren&#39;t based on true glucose levels or performed on a large scale. As such, you should treat these results as anecdotal rather than an absolute indication of accuracy. The FDA requires all glucometers sold in the U.S. to be accurate within 15 percent of the true glucose level, 95 percent of the time, and meters go through rigorous testing before they are released to the public.","One of the best things about the Verio IQ is the availability of its test strips. You can find them almost everywhere, even local pharmacies like Walgreens. And the test strips are effective at drinking up your blood, despite being a little awkward at first – you have to touch the side of the strip to the sample rather than the tip as with most glucometer test strips.","That said, the cost of the Verio IQ’s tests strips is its biggest downside. While the price has gone down since 2016, when each strip cost an average of $1.40, they are still the most expensive ones we reviewed. Now they cost an average of $1.22 per strip. By comparison, the <a href=\"/true-metrix-review\">TRUE METRIX AIR</a> strips cost about 24 cents per strip and the <a href=\"/onetouch-ultra-review\">OneTouch Ultra 2</a> strips cost about 33 cents per strip. (This does not take insurance coverage into consideration.)","The OneTouch Verio IQ’s highlight is its large, easy-to-read display. With nearly half of diabetics suffering from some vision impairment, this is a necessary feature to consider. Still, it doesn’t have a voice feature that reads your levels to you like some other glucometers do.","As soon as you insert a glucose test strip, the color screen lights up, so you can read your test results in any lighting condition. There are special color icons and flags that notify you of different problems such as high or low glucose levels or a low battery. With the Verio IQ, you can also set your own normal range between 20 and 600 ml/dL.","The Verio IQ glucose meter can hold up to 750 readings at one time, which means the monitor can help you accurately identify trends and patterns. Its proprietary Pattern Alert technology shows you what&#39;s happening over time so you can gain better control over your blood sugar levels. All of this happens in the glucometer, though you can transfer data to your computer. However, it doesn’t come with data management software.","The OneTouch Verio glucose test strips don’t require coding, and they have a side-fill design – the device can read the small 0.4-microliter blood sample from either side of the strip. The glucometer scans each blood sample 500 times while correcting for interferences such as the presence of antibiotics or pain-relief medicine. LifeScan, the meter’s maker, also offers a lancing system for drawing the blood sample and gives you a choice of either a 30- or 33-gauge lancet. The manufacturer recommends you only use these lancets for fingertip testing, but palm testing is an alternative if you purchase special lancets separately.","LifeScan&#39;s OneTouch Verio IQ runs on a rechargeable battery, and each kit includes an AC adapter and USB cable for recharging. This blood sugar meter measures 3.46 x 1.85 x 0.47 inches, and it weighs a mere 1.66 ounces with the battery installed. It also comes with a three-year warranty from the manufacturer. A software management system is available for free download after you register your glucose meter on the company&#39;s website, but you need to purchase a data cable from OneTouch to link your glucose meter to your computer.","The OneTouch Verio IQ is a good choice for learning your blood sugar level patterns and trends. Keep in mind that the test strips are fairly expensive, and the system does not support alternative testing sites. Still, this glucose meter has a lot to offer with its LCD color screen, well-lit display and accurate trending."]},"id":"32a06fcf-c4b3-45fb-a50b-cd112aba18da","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60912","url":"/onetouch-verio-iq-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-23T15:53:29Z","datePublished":"2014-10-23T15:53:29Z","name":"OneTouch Verio IQ","synopsis":"LifeScan’s OneTouch Verio IQ is one of the most recognizable glucometers on the market.","review":{"rating":72,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"LifeScan’s OneTouch Verio IQ is one of the most recognizable glucometers on the market.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-02-22T00:00:00Z","id":"g6gYWv4JZ2W3rMmuttv7HS","meta":{"title":"OneTouch Verio IQ Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The OneTouch Verio IQ stores up to 750 readings to help you manage your diabetes.
