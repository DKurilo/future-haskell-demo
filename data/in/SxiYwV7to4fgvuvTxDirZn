Look to see whether your computer has a USB 2.0 or 1.1 or FireWire port then choose a DVD player that will work with that port. Keep in mind that a USB 1.1 is extremely slow and that ports can be added at a reasonable price. If you use a unique disc type, such as DVD-RAM, CD-Text or CD+G look to see that these formats are supported.","Below are the criteria TopTenREVIEWS used to evaluate external DVD Drives:","<strong>Feature Set</strong><br/>We evaluated all of the features available with the DVD burner such as whether they have the ability to copy to dual layer discs and if they are compatible with popular <a href=\"/best-dvd-copy-software\">DVD copying software</a>. We also looked at what kind of software package comes with the hardware and noted the types of ports they require.","<strong>Burner Speed</strong><br/>Burning speed is especially significant when choosing a DVD burner. However, the type of blank media used to read/write/rewrite also impact speed.","<strong>Help &amp; Support</strong><br/>This ranking depends on how quick the product manufacturer responded to our email inquiries about their product. We sent an email to the technical support team of every product we reviewed. This criterion also considers some of the other help/support contact methods available such as live chat, telephone, FAQs, a searchable knowledge base, troubleshooting guides, easy driver downloads, etc."," Be sure to check out our top ranked <strong>external DVD burners</strong>: <a href=\"/computers/peripherals/best-external-dvd-burners/plextor-px-88ou-review/\">Plextor PX-880U</a>, <a href=\"/computers/peripherals/best-external-dvd-burners/hp-dvd556s-review/\">HP dvd556s</a> and <a href=\"/computers/peripherals/best-external-dvd-burners/lg-gp08nu20-review/\">LG GP08NU20</a>."]},"id":"9d9da827-5c4a-4aec-8e40-bd61d0f87a2d","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"91e9d05f-d363-4f03-9389-d91245602361","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FJTH5I/?&tag=ttr_external-dvd-burners-20&ascsubtag=[site|ttr[cat|148[art|NA[pid|48615[tid|NA[bbc|NA\">HP dvd556s</a>","<a href=\"http://www.circuitcity.com/rpsm/oid/118299/rpem/ccd/productDetailSpecification.do#tabs\">I/O Magic</a>"],"type":"ul"},"id":"d9f79fd5-83d6-412b-bd64-700bd0121dcc","type":"list"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"comparison_page_148","url":"/best-external-dvd-burners","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeff-ropelato","url":"/author/jeff-ropelato","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jeff Ropelato","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"ZFTp4R9MHcSeWJm9weTSoE","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2006-03-01T07:00:00Z","datePublished":"2011-09-12T15:05:49Z","name":"External DVD Burners","synopsis":"Save your original DVDs and CDs, create music mixes or author your own video.
