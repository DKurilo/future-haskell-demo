You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Amazon Fire Phone should have been amazing. It has four extra cameras that do nothing but track your face so you can enjoy a fun, faux-3D user interface. It boasts Firefly, an app that lets you scan any retail package and bring it up in the Amazon store. It has a 2.2GHz processor that trounces benchmarks, a respectable battery that can push through a day and a half of use, and a premium metal-and-glass chassis.","Yet instead of garnering an immediate following, the Fire Phone is a disappointment. Granted, Amazon&#39;s put together a solid, functional <a href=\"/best-smartphones\">smartphone</a> that could easily serve as your pocket computer for the next two years, but it doesn&#39;t do anything exceedingly well. Its killer features, Dynamic Perspective and Firefly, are underwhelming. Its operating system is awkward and fails to provide the intuitive accessibility Amazon promised in its early teasers. And the phone itself is a brick – thick, heavy and ugly.","<strong>Dynamic Perspective</strong>","Every smartphone has a feature we can&#39;t wait to get to in our reviews, and for the Fire Phone, that feature is Dynamic Perspective. Where other top smartphones have two cameras, one in front and one in back, the Fire Phone has six. Five of them are on the front of the device, and four of those do nothing but track your face at all times. They can even see you in the dark, thanks to the infrared lamps paired with each low-power lens.","Creepiness factor aside, it&#39;s a huge amount of technology dedicated to a single purpose: giving you a quasi-3D interface that tilts around on the screen as you physically tilt the phone. The software tries to make it seem like what&#39;s on the screen is rotating in 3D space with the movement of the phone, but it doesn&#39;t do a good job. Everything rotates slightly too far – in some cases, way too far – which turns what could be a subtly beautiful effect into a garish annoyance.","Thankfully, you can turn Dynamic Perspective off. Once you do, however, those four extra cameras are just wasted weight in a phone that, at 5.64 ounces, is already shockingly heavy for its size.","<strong>Firefly</strong>","The other Amazonian exclusive is Firefly, a feature that uses the rear camera to identify products and find them in Amazon&#39;s store. Firefly works best when it&#39;s used as a price comparator: You&#39;re in Best Buy or Wal-Mart, see something you like, and you long-press the dedicated camera button to launch your phone directly into the app. Assuming Firefly recognizes the product, your phone will tell you whether Amazon has it at a cheaper price. (They normally do.) You can then buy the product right from your phone, getting it shipped to you within a couple days thanks to the free year of Amazon Prime that comes with every Fire Phone.","Firefly can also be handy when you want to stock up on items around the home. Almost out of shampoo? Scan the bottle and order more before you run out completely. It&#39;s a great idea that Amazon fanatics will love, but we wish it were more dependable. In our testing, it only found products that were in their original packages, and even then had about a 60 percent success rate. Fortunately, Firefly is for more than just buying things: You can also scan printed phone numbers, QR codes, barcodes, email addresses and URLs, to name a few.","<strong>The Rest of the Story</strong>","Beneath Dynamic Perspective and Firefly sits Amazon&#39;s Fire OS 3.5. While technically based on Android, the operating system bears little resemblance to Google&#39;s interface. In its early teaser videos for the Fire Phone, Amazon boasted about the OS&#39;s intuitive nature; in truth, the interface is clunky and awkward. Menu drawers slide out of either side of the screen, but their contents change from app to app and sometimes aren&#39;t there at all. More than once, we tried to open a drawer and thought we were doing a gesture wrong, only to finally realize that the app in question didn&#39;t have that drawer at all.","The most recognizable element of Fire OS is probably the Carousel: a rotating, one-icon-at-a-time sequence of recently used applications. The Carousel takes up half the home screen, and its linear nature can make finding the app you want a slow process. By dragging up on the app drawer at the bottom of the screen, you can open a grid-based list of every application on your phone; we found ourselves keeping it open almost exclusively.","Being able to easily access your apps is crucial, but downloading new apps is equally important to a great phone. Sadly, the limited nature of Amazon&#39;s Appstore means doing what you want on your phone isn&#39;t always an option. Many industry-leading apps aren&#39;t yet available on Amazon&#39;s ecosystem, while some – like Google&#39;s Maps, Drive and Gmail – are unlikely to ever show up."]},"id":"18e11785-0a93-4c09-a766-8afb2d4bd323","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"3857cb34-ee23-463c-b10d-f8f9393c0993","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["It&#39;s tough to hate on Amazon.
