While not setting any new standards of excellence, it is a full featured smartphone at a reasonable price and is worthy of consideration.","Standout Features"]},"id":"7265769d-d74c-4194-95ec-bc0b9e04fc3b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["3-inch Resistive Touch Screen","Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional OS","GPS and Wi-Fi","Digital Camera and Video Recorder"],"type":"ul"},"id":"c6198ca7-b614-4d0f-9959-07cdbff1ef79","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<br/>Features","Restive Touch Screen","We all know that touch screens are popular and, for the most part, one isn’t radically different from another. The LG Instinct’s screen is bright and clear but not exceptional. It has a 3-inch diagonal measure and 240 x 400 pixel resolution making it mainstream. It does feature haptic feedback, a slight vibration to the finger, which helps in confirming that you’ve pressed what you intended. Unlike most other touch screens, it is resistive rather than capacitive. That means that you have the option on touching it with your finger or the included stylus. Rather oddly, the device lacks a slot for storing the stylus. It has a built-in accelerometer which automatically changes the display orientation from portrait to landscape when the device is rotated. In portrait orientation, the keyboard is full QWERTY, while in portrait mode, the virtual keyboard resembles the SureType, two-letters-per-key arrangement featured on the <a href=\"/blackberry-8130pnkvzn-21154-review\">BlackBerry Pearl. </a>It also senses ambient light and adjusts the screen brightness accordingly.","Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional OS","Though WinMo is not generally recognized as the most intuitive, user friendly, operating system for smartphones, it does have the advantage of coming complete with the full MS Office Mobile suite of programs so document viewing, creation, and editing is available. It also provides full support for MS Exchange and Outlook allowing for wireless synchronization with your enterprise email, calendar, and address book. Support for personal POP3 and IMAP email formats is also included.","Multimedia Features","The LG Incite has a basic 3-megapixel camera which offers several resolution quality and effect options but lacks flash and auto-focus features. It also can be used as a video recorder but both the still photos and videos are lackluster. For audio and video playback, the device is equipped Windows Media Player 10 featuring a customizable equalizer and typical playlist options.","GPS and Wi-Fi","The LG Incite comes equipped with a GPS receiver that, when combined with the AT&amp;T Navigator service, affords audible, turn-by-turn directions. Its Wi-Fi capability will provide data transfer speeds even faster than AT&amp;T’s 3G network, especially in areas where cellular service is weak.","Battery Life","Talk time for the Incite is estimated at 520 minutes with 504 hours of predicted standby time.","Design","Dominated by its attractive touch screen, the LG Incite falls into line with the design philosophy that is prevalent in this category. It’s sleek and very shiny. So shiny, if fact, that you may be tempted to handle it with a polishing cloth.","The Incite is a worthy first U.S. smartphone for LG. It offers all of the expected smartphone capabilities but doesn’t represent a threat to the very best phones in this category. It is, however, an exceptional device for the price."]},"id":"3c02612d-98ab-4ab6-ad25-8631203d3ae5","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_28120","url":"/lg-3140220-25073-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-02-04T07:00:00Z","datePublished":"2009-02-04T07:00:00Z","name":"LG Incite CT810 3140220","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":49,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2009-02-13T23:38:41Z","id":"WNUuPt2TzorS2U8NGbKeHi","meta":{"title":"LG Incite CT810 Review | Top Ten Reviews","description":"Visit Top Ten Reviews to read the latest reviews and opinions.
