While the average response speed was twice as slow as GreatCall, it was still fast enough to tie for second fastest in the tests, averaging under 30 seconds. However, the quality of the interactions with emergency responders is why this service earned my pick. There was not a single negative call.       <br />\n       <br />\nWhile the responders follow a script, just like other services, every person was calm, spoke clearly and always maintained a positive tone. They never sounded bored, in a rush or simply going through the motions. Every responder asked at least twice if I was okay. They always confirmed my information and indicated when they were going to end the call and encouraged me to press the button if I needed help. These all may seem like minor details, but the difference really stands out when you're comparing ten medical alert services one after the other. This sort of service goes a long way towards alleviating the inherent anxiety of calling an emergency call center.        <br />\n       <br />\nAnother reason why Medical Guardian is one of the best medical alert services is the Freedom Guardian, a medical alert smartwatch. This is a water-resistant smartwatch capable of receiving text-messages and providing alerts from your phone, such as a reminder for a doctor's appointment. It connects to a cellular network and features a large red button for calling help. You talk to emergency responders from the watch. It's ideal for seniors who want a more discreet medical alert system. Nobody will ever see this and think it's a medical alert device.        <br />\n       <br />\nThe Freedom Guardian is not as versatile, stylish or as well-built as MobileHelp's Samsung-made medical alert smartwatch. It doesn't double as fitness tracker and health monitor. And the monthly cost is nearly twice as much at about $45. But it's much easier to use, especially if your senior loved one isn't particularly tech adept. The interface is simpler, the icons are bigger, and it only has two buttons. This makes it far less difficult to get lost in. In addition, the upfront cost is much more affordable at about $99, versus MobileHelp's $350.    <br />\n   <br />\nTo speak to a Medical Guardian representative, call 1-800-745-1200.","<a href=\"/medical-guardian-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"9b286316-e381-4ea7-a118-7ce0931c33ef","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Fastest Emergency Medical Alert Response Time"},"id":"b33c76cd-a654-454c-9b1e-20ce44bb1526","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/dFnWsadx4oQSyYYn2CJHSn.jpg","link":{"href":"https://www.toptenreviews.com/health/senior-care/best-medical-alert-systems/greatcall-review/","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/L/7/812059/original/Medical-Alert-Systems-GreatCall-002.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dFnWsadx4oQSyYYn2CJHSn.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"dFnWsadx4oQSyYYn2CJHSn","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dFnWsadx4oQSyYYn2CJHSn.jpg","alt":"GreatCall"},"id":"1760afbb-86b1-4581-af78-523217016153","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"GreatCall\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":0,"url":"","name":"","id":""},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/greatcall-review\">GreatCall</a>","pros":["Fastest call response time","Very affordable mobile system","High quality speaker for clear communication"],"cons":["No medical information packet","The Lively Wearable doesn’t have a display","Emergency response quality was just average"]},"id":"710ef7d0-285c-4aa7-91a2-3985f3dee0f3","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["","GreatCall had the fastest emergency response in our test and is among the most affordable.

So if you pay for a full year upfront, the cost can be lowered by as much as $5 per month. ","<strong>Are Medical Alert Systems Covered by Medicare? </strong>","Unfortunately, while Medicare covers a lot of medical equipment prescribed by a doctor, medical alert systems aren’t covered by Medicare Part A or Part B. These plans cover hospital and health insurance, and they can cover medical equipment like oxygen concentrators, wheelchairs and walkers. But they don’t cover services, procedures or equipment deemed elective by a physician. And medical alert services falls under this elective service and equipment.","However, according to <a href=\"https://medicare.com/coverage/does-medicare-cover-medical-alert-systems/\">Medicare.com</a>, a Medicare Part C Advantage plan might be an option for medical alert system coverage. Since Part C plans provide access to private fee-for-service HMOs and PPOs plans, the coverage can be more comprehensive and cover equipment and services not covered by Part A and B. The downside is it adds cost to your monthly budget and the coverage is dependent on what coverage is offered by private insurance companies in your area.","It’s worth consulting with an expert to evaluate your Part C options during the open enrollment period to see if you can receive coverage. But it’s important to weigh the cost of the Part C plan with the cost of medical alert system, as it could be more expensive even if you get coverage.","<strong>Are Medical Alert Systems Tax Deductible?</strong>","According to <a href=\"https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/3978563-are-medical-alert-systems-deductible\">TurboTax</a>, the IRS doesn’t specifically state whether or not medical alert systems can be a tax deduction. However, there might be ways to add your monthly subscription costs to your tax deductions. When you consider the cheapest medical alert systems cost between $240 and $360 per year, it might be worth looking into.","For starters, the general rule for medical expense deductions is any medical equipment prescribed by a doctor is a deductible expense. That said, since medical alert systems are considered elective medical equipment, it may not be easy to get a doctor to prescribe it.","Another potential option is deductions involving improvements made to a home for medical reasons. This typically includes widening doorways, adding wheelchair ramps, modifying bathrooms or other areas for disabilities. An in-home medical alert system could possibly fall under this category, as it involves installing equipment. That said, it doesn’t involve making home modifications.","Finally, the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/publications/p502#en_US_2015_publink1000178982\">IRS</a> allows deductions for medical and dental expenses. The deduction allows for medical expenses “paid to a plan that keeps medical information in a computer data bank and retrieves and furnishes the information upon request to an attending physician.” According to <a href=\"https://www.bayalarmmedical.com/medical-alert-blog/are-medical-alert-systems-tax-deductible/\">Bay Alarm Medical</a>, this allows you to deduct your medical alert system expenses because they store your medical profile in a database and provide the information to EMTs and other emergency providers upon request.","While it’s not explicitly defined by the IRS, it seems like you have several options.

So, you’re looking primarily at interest and dividend income from savings accounts and other financial accounts.","The second hurdle is how much of their support you take care of.

To determine this, you consider utility costs, medical bills, living expenses and the fair market value of their room in your home.","Potential Deductions<br/>If your parent doesn’t meet the dependent requirements, you can still deduct medical expenses, but only if you still cover over 50 percent of their support and the medical expenses exceed 10 percent of your income. These deductions include medical bills, hospital visits, medications, medical equipment and supplies, rehabilitation, in-home hospice care, mileage to doctor appointments and dental expenses. You can also deduct the cost of home modifications, including mortgage interest for the modifications, but only if the modifications don’t add value to the house.","When Siblings Share the Cost: Multiple Support Declaration<br/>As is often the case, you might share your elderly parent&#39;s caretaking costs with siblings or other relatives. If so, you can still claim your parent as a dependent and deduct medical expenses, as long as your parent’s income qualifies for the exemption limit and over 50 percent of his or her care and support is paid for by you and your siblings. This means, you can claim your parent as a dependent even if you only cover 40 percent of their support, so long as your brother or sister covers 10 percent or more.","However, only one of you can claim your parent as a dependent on each year’s tax return. So if you contribute 40 percent and your brother contributes 10 percent, only one of you can benefit from the dependent. It’s worth sitting down with your siblings before filing your taxes to determine who will claim the dependent to avoid double-filing and the potential fines.","If you have questions or concerns about whether your aging loved one qualifies to be a dependent, how to deduct medical expenses or whether you qualify for deductions, you should always consult with a certified accountant or tax expert. Not only should they have a firm grasp on the current laws and regulations, but they often know of additional tax deductions not listed here that can help you recoup some of the expenses of taking care of your aging parent.

I used this pricing comparison to narrow the list to the best ten services. We ordered the in-home landline system and mobile GPS system from each service and tested them over the course of three weeks.","Call Response Time<br/>Using a stopwatch, I timed how long it took from the time I pressed the help button to the moment an emergency responder answered. The best average response time, from three weeks of testing every day, averaged 14 seconds.

They provide seniors with a safety net, particularly when they live alone, allowing them to age in place longer. That said, there are two kinds of systems: in-home medical alert systems and mobile medical alert systems.","In-Home Systems<br/>In-home medical alert systems consist of a base unit and a waterproof pendant. They have wireless ranges between 300 and 1,500 feet, which wide enough to cover most homes and yards. The base unit is a specialized speakerphone with a loudspeaker and a sensitive microphone capable of picking up sounds from rooms away. It connects to a landline or cellular network, and when you need help, you press a button on the pendant and a wireless signal activates a call for help from the base unit to the medical alert service’s emergency response center. A trained operator then calmly assesses the emergency and determines whether to contact local emergency services to send help.","Mobile Medical Alert Systems<br/>Mobile systems work in the same way as in-home systems – you press a button and it calls an emergency response center. However, these systems combine the base unit and the waterproof pendant into one wearable device you can take anywhere. By comparison, a mobile medical alert system is the safer option. Not only does it provide unlimited range, but it also allows for far better communication with emergency responders, which is a critical part of a successful medical alert system.","Imagine this scenario – your loved one is in the garden and accidentally presses the button or activates a fall-detection sensor on the pendant. It calls for help, but she’s unlikely to realize it because she’s too far from the base unit to hear the operator. And if the operator can’t hear her, an ambulance is sent to her house.  ","According to Scott Lepper, an EMT and CEO of RescueTouch, if this scenario happens, the EMTs are likely going to convince her to &#34;take a bumpy ride to the emergency department even if they don&#39;t need to go.&#34; This is, as he suggests, the result of emergency protocols and liabilities.  The entire event results in &#34;unnecessary attention from neighbors, a night in the (emergency room) for mom, and hospital and ambulance bills.","The false-alert scenario is not an exaggeration. It happened twice during the tests. The second time occurred hours after I finished testing. One of the systems somehow called for help (for reasons I have not been able to figure out). Since nobody was in the lab to answer the call, the emergency responders sent an ambulance to our address. On a positive note, however, the ambulance arrived less than 10 minutes from the time the device called for help. With a mobile system, this scenario is very unlikely because you are never more than a foot away from communicating with the emergency responders.","<strong>Medical Alert Smartwatches: A New, Discreet Option</strong>","At the 2018 CES, MobileHelp and Medical Guardian announced intentions of launching medical alert smartwatches this year. These are the only medical alert smartwatches on the market, though I expect this to change. I tested both watches in conjunction with the services&#39; standard medical alert systems.  Both are impressive steps forward for the medical alert industry, but for different reasons. "]},"id":"9758f4ff-14cc-46f7-ac06-72a77e031204","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/4T77hzcVPY5SJ4oxQSRST3.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The MobileHelp Smart is a stylish and versatile smartwatch made by Samsung.

However, the service is expensive compared to other services we reviewed, and the call response time was very slow.","<strong>Why Some Services Didn&#39;t Make the Cut?</strong>","I’ve tested systems from 32 medical alert services, and I know from my research there are over 73 services in the country offering medical alert systems, though most are regional-based home security companies. At the end of the day, this means some very well-known and big companies didn’t make the cut. There are also some companies that approach medical alerts from such a different perspective, they aren’t comparable to other services but are worth considering.","Life Alert<br/>Life Alert is undoubtedly the biggest name in the medical alert industry. The tagline, “I&#39;ve fallen and I can&#39;t get up,&#34; has been part of the pop culture since the 1980s and the commercials are so common, they’ve been satirized and memed. In fact, there is a good chance Life Alert is the only medical alert service you know. Just because you recognize a brand doesn’t mean it’s better.","Life Alert didn’t make the cut because it requires a three-year contract. To cancel the contract, you have to prove the person using the system no longer needs it. You can’t cancel simply because you can’t afford it. You have to provide a death certificate or proof the senior now requires 24-hour supervision in a nursing facility. In addition, Life Alert is not transparent with its pricing structure and requires you to talk to a salesperson to learn about the prices. This is a major red-flag with any service, but especially one dealing with seniors, as there is too much potential for unethical sales tactics. For these reasons, I cannot recommend Life Alert.","Philips Lifeline<br/>Philips is one of the biggest manufacturers of health-related technology in the U.S., so it’s the other medical alert company most people recognize. The company offers four unique systems not used by other services, and the systems have been good in the past when I’ve tested them. (You can read about my 2017 review of <a href=\"https://www.dignifyed.com/philips-lifeline-review-20.html\">Philips Lifeline</a> on Dignifyed.) In fact, we ordered the HomeSafe with AutoAlert and the GoSafe 2 to be included with our testing. However, the GoSafe 2 was back ordered and we weren’t able to test it in time, and the HomeSafe’s performance was not good enough to break into the top ten medical alert systems. And the pricing structure is the primary reason.","In addition to having monthly subscription costs that are more expensive than most similar systems on the market, Philips Lifeline also charges fees most services don&#39;t, and these add up. There&#39;s a $50 activation fee, equipment fees ranging between $99 and $150 depending on the package, and a $20 self-installation fee. These tacked-on costs make this service too costly to recommend to seniors. There are better performing systems at more affordable prices for it to be considered one of the top ten medical alert services at this time.","RescueTouch<br/><a href=\"https://www.dignifyed.com/rescuetouch-review-6.html\">RescueTouch</a> is a unique medical alert service and didn’t make the cut primarily because most of the packages it offers aren’t comparable to other services. And the one comparable package, a mobile system that calls an emergency response center, is too expensive by comparison. However, RescueTouch is a service that offers something different, so it’s worth looking into it if the traditional services don’t fit your needs.","Every package RescueTouch sells uses the same SOS mobile medical alert device, but the cheapest package costs just $20 and calls 911 directly. However, the other packages vary widely in scope and purpose. Some only call emergency contacts. Some are designed for senior couples. There are also packages for veterans struggling with PTSD and other mental health issues, connecting them to mental health support when they need it rather than an emergency response center. As far as I have seen, RescueTouch is the only service providing packages like this.","<strong>Should You Add Fall Detection? </strong>","According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/falls/adultfalls.html\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, a quarter of seniors over 65 fall each year, and a fifth of these falls results in a serious injury. To address this, medical alert services started offering fall detection sensors in 2015 as an add-on option to medical alert systems. But at a cost of about $10 per month, is a fall detection sensor worth it?  The short answer is not yet.","We ordered the fall detection add-ons offered by service and thoroughly tested them in conjunction with our other tests. I dropped them from varying heights. I wore them as I simulated dozens of falls, rolls and stumbles onto a variety of surfaces. I dangled them from my finger. I threw them into the ground. You can read about the tests in more detail in our <a href=\"/best-fall-detection-sensors\">fall detection sensors review</a>. But after over two years of testing over 30 fall detection sensors from 21 medical alert services, I have yet to find a consistent fall detection sensor worth the additional cost. ","In my tests, the consistency of the sensors varied wildly. Some seemingly detected falls for no reason, incapable of determining the difference between real falls and small bumps. One even detected falls while resting on the table. Another detected falls when plugged into the charger because it vibrated to indicate the charge. Nearly half of the fall detection sensors I tested simply wouldn&#39;t detect anything unless I threw them on the ground.","<strong>Senior Care Technology for Caretakers</strong>","The more you rely on technology to help you take care of aging loved ones, the more quality time you can spend with them.
