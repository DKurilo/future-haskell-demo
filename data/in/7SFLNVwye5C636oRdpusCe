Motor Club is Allstate Insurance’s <a href=\"/best-roadside-assistance-services\">roadside assistance service</a>. You don’t need to have an auto insurance policy through Allstate to sign up for roadside assistance, though you can get discounts if you bundle both services together. We compared roadside assistance programs based on a variety of factors, including pricing and the services offered at each plan level. Allstate comes out on top because of its low prices and the excellent benefits it offers at all service levels.","The Roadside Advantage plan is Allstate’s most basic service level. It costs $52 a year, which is slightly more than $4 a month. This is the least expensive plan we saw and is significantly more affordable than <a href=\"/good-sam-roadside-assistance-review\">Good Sam Roadside Assistance</a>. You can also add teen drivers to your policy for an extra $2 a month, which is significantly less than other services charge to add additional family members. However, you’re limited to three service calls a year.","The basic plan’s primary benefit is a $100 reimbursement on all roadside assistance, no matter the incident. Whether you have a flat tire, need a jump-start, or need a tow, Allstate pays you back $100 for the expenses you incur. Unlike other services, which offer free towing for a certain number of miles instead of a payout, Allstate’s roadside assistance can pay you back for longer tows. However, there are drawbacks to a reimbursement system – you have to pay with your own money initially and fill out paper work, then wait for the company to send you your money.","Roadside Advantage also includes trip interruption reimbursement. If you’re in an accident or your car becomes otherwise undrivable while you are far from home, Allstate reimburses you up to $750 for expenses like food, lodging, car rentals or other transportation. Trip interruption reimbursement is typically only found in premium plans, so this is another area where Allstate stands out. If you opt for the company’s premium plan, Platinum Elite, you can get up to $1,500 for trip reimbursement.","Platinum Elite costs $99 a year, which is about $8 a month. At the Platinum Elite level, you get $250 worth of reimbursement for roadside assistance. As with the standard plan, this can be applied to towing, jump-starts, fuel delivery and a variety of other services. A reimbursement of $250 can pay for a longer distance tow, so it ends up being at least equivalent to services that offer 100 miles of free towing. This plan also includes a road hazard benefit of $250. If your tires or wheels are damaged, Allstate pays you back for up to $250 of the cost of repairs.","Another area where Allstate stands out is its on-time guarantee. If service doesn’t reach you within 30 minutes of being dispatched, you get a discount on the next year’s membership dues.","Allstate Motor Club includes a variety of discounts on car rentals and hotels. It is also one of the few roadside assistance services that offers discounts on additional things like cruises and flights. As a member, you also receive offers and discounts at various attractions."]},"id":"3a8baf80-a52b-4a5e-b1d2-9b0fe2cba3b9","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_53675","url":"/allstate-motor-club-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"eli-mccormick","url":"/author/eli-mccormick","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Eli McCormick","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"CSoTtbWogSTgZ9Xgr3Anr9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2011-09-25T18:10:18Z","datePublished":"2011-09-25T18:10:18Z","name":"Allstate Motor Club","synopsis":"Allstate Motor Club is Allstate Insurance’s roadside assistance service.","review":{"rating":97,"verdict":"Allstate Motor Club has some of the lowest prices and best reimbursement rates for roadside assistance, making it our choice for the best service overall.","pros":["It has the least expensive basic plan."],"cons":["You&#8217;re limited to three service calls a year."]},"strapline":"Allstate Motor Club is Allstate Insurance’s roadside assistance service.","language":"en","dateModified":"2019-03-19T00:00:00Z","id":"7SFLNVwye5C636oRdpusCe","meta":{"title":"Allstate Motor Club Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Allstate Motor Club has some of the lowest prices and best reimbursement rates for roadside assistance, making it our choice for the best service overall."},"products":[{"slug":"allstate-motor-club","url":"/product/allstate-motor-club","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:11:17Z","name":"Allstate Motor Club","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:11:17Z","id":"tZw9AnMvV4uYcEKNQEiQET","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:11:17Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/zE5ALYnB7CV4PDJpXuXpgC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:11:17Z","mimeType":"","name":"b4e674662d0b945718ab8981dd11103f.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/b4e674662d0b945718ab8981dd11103f.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:11:17Z","id":"zE5ALYnB7CV4PDJpXuXpgC","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zE5ALYnB7CV4PDJpXuXpgC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Allstate Motor Club Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Allstate Motor Club has some of the lowest prices and best reimbursement rates for roadside assistance, making it our choice for the best service overall."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/zE5ALYnB7CV4PDJpXuXpgC.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:11:17Z","mimeType":"","name":"b4e674662d0b945718ab8981dd11103f.jpg","importSrc":"/i/pdp/b4e674662d0b945718ab8981dd11103f.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:11:17Z","id":"zE5ALYnB7CV4PDJpXuXpgC","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zE5ALYnB7CV4PDJpXuXpgC.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Allstate Motor Club Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"Allstate Motor Club has some of the lowest prices and best reimbursement rates for roadside assistance, making it our choice for the best service overall."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/services/auto/best-roadside-assistance-services/allstate-motor-club-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"travel-and-auto","url":"/travel-and-auto","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:11:17Z","name":"Travel & Auto","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:11:17Z","id":"HmhJjMTFinoVnKmEwqRGEm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"auto-services","url":"/travel-and-auto/auto-services","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:11:17Z","name":"Auto Services","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:11:17Z","id":"gtW4iQeXfGEkPDzPmkxeaB","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
