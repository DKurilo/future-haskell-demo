Test N’GO is a slim blood <a href=\"/best-glucometers\">glucose meter</a> with Bluetooth to sync your readings with the iFORA data management app. This is one of the best glucometers on the market because the well-designed app makes tracking your health very easy. In fact, it&#39;s one of my favorite data management systems, though connecting the meter to my phone was not as easy as I&#39;d like.","For this review, I tested the glucometers’ accuracy by using each one to test my blood multiple times a day for three weeks. During each round of tests, I averaged the readings from all 11 meters and calculated an acceptable range, with the maximum set at 15 percent above the average and the minimum at 15 percent below it. Any readings outside this range were noted as being likely inaccurate.","In these tests, the Test N&#39;GO received an average C grade. That said, my accuracy tests aren&#39;t based on true glucose levels, which require medical lab testing. Rather, they are based on the assumption that the average reading of the same blood sample would be closer to the true glucose levels than otherwise. Keep in mind that all glucose meters sold in the U.S. must be approved by the FDA, which has strict accuracy requirements. Per FDA standards, a glucometer needs to be within 15 percent of the true glucose level 95 percent of the time, and each one goes through rigorous, large-scale testing to prove it is capable. My tests were small-scale and should be interpreted as anecdotal","The FORA Test N’GO’s biggest downside is its test strips aren’t widely available. I couldn’t find them in any of the brick-and-mortar pharmacies I visited, and only a few of the online stores, including the FORA website, carried them. Since FORA is one of the smallest brands we reviewed, it&#39;s understandable that it doesn’t have the same distribution as big brands like <a href=\"/contour-next-review\">Contour Next</a> and <a href=\"/accu-chek-review\">Accu-Chek Aviva</a>, whose test strips are available everywhere. If you&#39;re vigilant in making sure you order your test strips well in advance of running out, this lack of availability is just a minor issue.","On the plus side, FORA’s test strips are inexpensive. In my evaluation, they received a B+ for affordability because they cost an average of about 40 cents each. In fact, only a few brands have more affordable strips – the <a href=\"/true-metrix-review\">TRUE METRIX AIR</a>’s cost about 23 cents per strip. By comparison, the Accu-Chek Aviva and <a href=\"/onetouch-verio-iq-review\">OneTouch Verio</a> both use strips that cost over $1 each. (This evaluation was made without factoring in insurance, which could lower the cost depending on your coverage.)","The FORA Test N’GO&#39;s major selling point is its Bluetooth connectivity, which it uses to sync readings from the glucometer with the iFORA app. The app allows you to better recognize trends in your glucose levels, track your meals and calculate your insulin needs. It’s very easy to use and helps you better manage your diabetes in the moment because you can immediately see important information. You can view your averages over time in graphs, making it easy for both you and your doctor to interpret the data. In fact, it&#39;s one our favorite data management systems.","However, pairing the Test N&#39;GO with your smartphone is a significant hurdle. In fact, I was never able to successfully pair the two, even after consulting the instructions repeatedly. Part of the problem with this meter is that it has just one button to navigate all its features and settings. And despite the simplicity of a single button, it&#39;s not easy to figure out how to access anything beyond cycling through all your readings. I had more success with the <a href=\"/fora-review\">FORA TN&#39;G Voice</a>, which also has just one button but was easier to pair to Bluetooth.","The device itself is well made. It’s small and slender – not much bigger than a thumb drive. It can store up to 450 readings, which is fewer than most blood glucose meters, but when you consider that the data transfers to your phone, it’s not a big deal. The display is high contrast and easy to read, which is good for diabetics who have vision problems.","If you want a glucometer that can help you track your glucose in real time so you can better manage your diabetes, then the FORA Test N’GO is a good option with affordable test strips. With its well-designed app and Bluetooth, your data management needs are easily satisfied."]},"id":"6bad63ba-89d2-4728-bdaf-072b8d00568f","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60906","url":"/fora-test-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jeph-preece","url":"/author/jeph-preece","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Jeph Preece","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"UEqrRM5xmXnCHCjkbS6o5e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-10-23T15:51:53Z","datePublished":"2014-10-23T15:51:53Z","name":"FORA Test N'GO","synopsis":"The FORA Test N’GO is a slim blood glucose meter with Bluetooth to sync your readings with the iFORA data management app.","review":{"rating":80,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"The FORA Test N’GO is a slim blood glucose meter with Bluetooth to sync your readings with the iFORA data management app.","language":"en","dateModified":"2018-02-22T00:00:00Z","id":"McbFb3aDRwMiyNLSKK3j8Y","meta":{"title":"FORA Test N'GO Review - Pros, Cons and Verdict","description":"The FORA Test N&#8217;GO has Bluetooth and can transfer your readings to a data management app. Find out why it is the best glucometer for managing your diabetes.
