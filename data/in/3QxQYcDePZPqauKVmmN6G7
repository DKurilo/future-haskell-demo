It comes with SVGA 858 x 600 resolution. The brightness is decent at 50 ANSI lumens, but with an image size of only 15 to 60 inches. We were hoping for something a bit larger, but this is still a fairly good size. The aspect ratio is 4:3 and the contrast ratio is only 800:1; on other products 2000:1 is common. We were hoping for something with a little more pizzazz from a company like Dell, but all-in-all these are functional specifications – you just have to make sure the room is fairly dark and the audience is relatively close."]},"id":"20401829-a250-4da0-b778-98b3f6242ba0","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Projection System"},"id":"b3cf04fe-f313-4b17-9566-9b87072e56f0","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["There is only one port on this mini projector, but the cable that comes with the device enables both a VGA and composite A/V input.

The lamp life is the lowest we&#39;ve seen on a mini projector – only 10,000 hours – but it is still better than larger projectors of the same projection type. There is no built in speaker, internal memory or option to use an SD card. You do have the option of assigning a password to keep your presentations safe and secure.  It is still really small at 3.6 x 4.1 x 1.5 inches and it only weighs 0.8 pounds.

All of the buttons on top of the unit are well organized and easy to figure out; the only problem is that there is no remote, so it is impossible to control it unless you are standing right next to it. Another small concern is that not all of the buttons are lit, so when you are in a dark room it can be difficult to see which button you need to press. The manual focus is really convenient to use, but we would have also liked something that could tilt the projector.
