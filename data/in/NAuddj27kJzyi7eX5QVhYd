In the time it takes to listen to the entire record, the turntable will record and begin converting the audio to a digital format, directly to your computer. The USB record player even includes software that can edit and enhance the music.","A belt-drive turntable on a durable plastic platter makes this vinyl converter turntable look sleek and gives it a heavy, quality feel. It is one of the best-looking portable vinyl converters on the market. The tone arm is fully automatic, and with the touch of a button the diamond stylus will gently lift off of your record and return to its point of origin. This automatic feature protects your record from scratches. The player doesn’t include anti-skate protection, so if you records are damaged with scratches or dings, the recording will pick up the crackling skip sounds apparent in older vinyl records.","The Crosley CR6004A does have adjustable playback speeds – 33 RPM and 45 RPM – but unfortunately can’t playback 78 RPM records. While 78s are rare, it would still be nice to have to option to convert the few you may have. Because the record has to play in its entirety to fully convert, you can listen along by connecting the player to your computer’s speakers, another speaker system or headphones.  Once the music is captured, you can then edit the music with the Audacity software which comes with the vinyl converter turntable. Editing options include clipping tract segments, arranging a playlist and removing background noise. This converter turntable doesn’t include pitch control, so any sound editing will have to be done using the Audacity software.","If you need help or support for this turntable, we would first turn to the included user manual. The manual has in-depth instructions on how to install the Audacity software and how to adjust the settings for appropriate conversion. Crosley’s website has some information on it, but most is very generic – nothing specifically about the Crosley CR6004A. If you need specific support for your Crosley turntable, contact the company directly via email or by phone. Their technical support representatives are very quick to respond. We emailed a query on a Monday night and received an answer back early Tuesday morning.  All Crosley products come with a one-year warranty.","Items included with the Crosley CR6004A turntable are as follows:"]},"id":"8e4e7c6e-cbdb-4bc5-8f3b-6a8e729e23f4","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Cartridge","Dustcover","Slipmat","45 RPM adapter","USB cable"],"type":"ul"},"id":"841313e8-7dee-4246-8eec-4a530529dffc","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Although the turntable includes a 45 RPM adapter, it doesn’t include any additional options to play 78 RPM records."]},"id":"21a0b248-27b2-4671-8265-66218c9057c8","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"797aef5b-a14b-4917-a8f3-2c2fc7f9164f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Crosley CR6004A USB turntable is by far one of the most handsome vinyl converter turntables available on the market.
