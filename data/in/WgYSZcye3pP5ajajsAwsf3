It also provides several features, including a rapid preheat setting and delayed bake options.","This wall double oven has convection cooking capabilities. This means a small fan inside the oven circulates the hot air, resulting in shorter cooking times and more evenly cooked food. However, this technology is only available in the upper oven. The lower oven only uses thermal cooking technology, which still uses hot air to cook the food but does not circulate the air.","Each oven cavity boasts 5 cubic feet of cooking space, giving you plenty of room for cooking multiple dishes at once. There are a total of six oven rack guides, so there are plenty of options for creating the right-sized space for whatever dishes you cook in the oven. As such, this oven is well suited for people with big families or those who like to entertain big groups.","The design of this Maytag wall double oven is similar to many other wall ovens. It has a stainless steel exterior with large windows on both ovens. It doesn&#39;t come in any other color options, but stainless steel is an attractive choice for many kitchens. If you are looking for a wall double oven with a variety of color options, the <a href=\"/ge-review\">GE JT3500EJS</a> comes in black, black ice, white ice and stainless steel. The oven features a touch display as a simple way to control the settings. Touch controls are also easier to clean than knobs and buttons.","There are several safety features to ensure you and your household are safe. When you use the self-cleaning setting, the oven doors automatically lock to ensure no one is exposed to the extremely high temperatures. Additionally, if the oven is left on for an extended time, it shuts off automatically.","For the self-cleaning cycle, which uses extreme heat to burn away debris, there are six different cleaning levels that range from three to five hours. Some ovens include a shorter self-cleaning cycle of about two hours for small messes, which can save you time. This oven does not have a steam self-clean feature either. Steam is a more effective method for regular maintenance and faster cleaning without the use of harsh chemicals.","A rapid preheat option lets you heat up the oven 20 percent faster than it would on the traditional preheat setting. The oven takes approximately 13 to 19 minutes to reach 350 degrees Fahrenheit on the traditional setting, although times vary depending on how many racks are inside the oven.","Another useful feature it includes is a cook-and-hold setting. With this setting on, your food cooks for the preset amount of time, and then the oven reduces to a warming temperature for one hour. A warm setting allows you to keep food warm for an extended period without overcooking it. Defrost and dehydrate settings are not available on this oven as they are on some others.","This electric wall double oven stands out with its 10-year manufacturer warranty for parts and labor. This is the longest warranty you can find on one of these ovens. Many similar products are only covered for one year.","The Maytag MEW9630FZ provides lots of cooking space. It also comes with a 10-year warranty in a product category where one-year warranties are the standard. It offers a convection cooking mode in the upper oven but not the lower one. Though it&#39;s missing some features, like steam cleaning, this is a powerful oven that provides plenty of cooking versatility."]},"id":"1bc32119-a7bc-4b93-bc8e-d4ad822dbffa","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_70261","url":"/maytag-mew9630fz-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"angie-parkinson","url":"/author/angie-parkinson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Angie Parkinson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4Pu3Dbh8P3CR8CNSJRVPZP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2018-09-26T15:52:40Z","datePublished":"2018-09-26T15:52:40Z","name":"Maytag MEW9630FZ","synopsis":"The Maytag MEW9630FZ is an electric double oven that features 5 cubic feet of cooking space, both convection and traditional thermal cooking technology, and a 10-year warranty on parts and labor.
