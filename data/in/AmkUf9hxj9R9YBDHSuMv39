You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Fujifilm’s underwater cameras offer many of the characteristics you will find in the best <a href=\"/best-waterproof-cameras\">waterproof cameras</a>. The FinePix XP60 stands out with its notable 16.4-megapixel sensor. Plus it has the ability to take photos 20 feet under water. You can use it in temperatures down to 14 degrees Fahrenheit and get clear images for sharing and for viewing on your computer. It is shockproof and dustproof, so you can expect durability. Unlike most rugged cameras in its class, it does not have a built-in GPS.","The Fujifilm FinePix XP60 is equipped with a 5X optical zoom and a 10X digital zoom for taking close up shots. It gives you optimal magnification without sacrificing clarity. Thanks to the built-in flash and CMOS sensor that regulates how much light is used by each pixel, you won’t get dark or grainy photos.","We are impressed with the dedicated burst mode button located on the top of the camera. You will get high-speed, continuous shooting of 10 frames per second at full resolution. You can switch into high-speed bursts of up to 60 to 70 frames per second, but your resolution and image quality will decrease.","This camera’s assortment of shooting modes includes portrait, panorama, snow and beach. Key functions such as white-balance, red-eye reduction and a self-timer are included. With in-camera editing features, you can crop and touch up photos directly from the digital camera itself. A selection of seven filters allow you to create artistic effects like pop color, toy camera and cross screen.","The unique 3D shooting mode allows you to get two exposures of one image. That image is then saved in a format that gives it the appearance of being shot in 3D. You can easily create high resolution 3D effects.","The FinePix XP60 has HD movie recording capabilities. We like the dedicated movie button that is located on the back of the camera. You just tap it to activate. The video recorder’s most outstanding characteristic is its slow motion video feature. This gives you the ability to capture a surfer carving turns in the water and view him in graceful slow motion later. Additionally, in-camera movie editing allows you to cut or clip footage together using the display screen. It even records sound.","This camera has a tough plastic casing with watertight seals that prevent leaking. Although it is waterproof, you will want to take precautions when using it in the water because it does not float. Additionally, the cameras design takes some getting used to because the lens extends over the top of the left side of the camera.  It is easy to get your fingers in your photos.","The FinePix XP60 comes equipped with a Li-ion battery, AC power adapter and USB cable. This camera only has 95MB of internal memory, so you will need to purchase a memory card for additional storage.","Fujifilm offers a one-year warranty on its cameras. The company website includes a FAQs page, email support and telephone support. "]},"id":"3b9058fb-f2a0-4b9e-8392-0373009992a9","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cf0450b9-b10c-4eab-8290-4f459a7af08d","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["This waterproof camera has a continuous shooting mode and impressive video features.
