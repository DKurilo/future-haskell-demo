As with any prepaid credit or debit card, there are fees and other charges for certain features. These are all pretty standard and might look familiar: a monthly fee, an activation fee and ATM charges.","You can add funds to your card a variety of ways, but you can also withdraw funds with ease. The Vision Prepaid credit card carries the Visa logo, which means you can withdraw money from your account (check Vision Prepaid&#39;s website for the maximum) at any of the 14,000 Visa member banks in the U.S.","There are a few flexible features to help you avoid ATM and card fees. Once such feature is text and email alerts. You can sign up for the alerts by accessing your online account. There are more than a dozen different alerts you can sign up for, such as daily balance, authorization and payment posted, which includes the amount of money that was deposited at the time.","Plastic can, indeed, be safer than cash. In fact, the money on your card is insured up to a certain amount. A prepaid card is safer than cash, because there is less risk of losing your money, but it&#39;s financially safer as well. When you use cash, keeping track of your expenditures can be difficult, and it&#39;s easy to lose track of where that money goes. With the Vision Prepaid credit card, you have an online account that makes tracking expenditures easy and makes it easier to adhere to your monthly budget.","Other useful features you can take advantage of with Vision Prepaid&#39;s credit card may include cash back incentives (on gas purchases), roadside assistance and a savings account. You must be an active cardholder to access these benefits. Active means you are loading money onto the card regularly. You can add funds to your card at thousands of locations, including wire services, but fees apply. You can also load money through direct deposit. This funding option allows you to deposit paychecks, government checks and tax refunds.","Vision Prepaid&#39;s website has an extensive FAQs section that offers a variety of in-depth answers and picture guides. For cardholders with direct deposit, speaking to a live agent is included in the cost of the plan. If you don&#39;t have the direct deposit option, you may be charged per call.","Vision Prepaid offers many appealing features, including a savings account, online bill pay and cash back on qualified purchases. Plus, you have the convenience of being able to make purchases anywhere Visa credit cards are accepted."]},"id":"eca40566-dedb-42cf-9332-0380ac26f959","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_3378","url":"/vision-premier-visa-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-contributor","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-contributor","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Contributor","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"w5zRTt8zKNM8ERYhxFTX9","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-07-16T15:42:57Z","datePublished":"2009-07-16T15:42:57Z","name":"Vision Prepaid","synopsis":"Vision Prepaid offers a prepaid credit card that lets you set up direct deposit, pay bills and shop online.
