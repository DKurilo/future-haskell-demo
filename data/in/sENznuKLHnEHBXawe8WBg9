The Magellan RoadMate 1200 is both affordable and useful and because it is a slimmed down version of some of Magellan’s other models, it’s much easier to use for newcomers to the GPS party.","The Magellan RoadMate 1200 is very simple both in design and interface. It has an unassuming, rounded black case and a 3.5-inch touchscreen that allows you to instantly access all the menus. The user interface is very easy to use (another benefit for newcomers to GPS navigation) with large icons and uncomplicated menus. The Magellan RoadMate 1200 also has a good point of interest database that catalogs all the restaurants, businesses and landmarks in your area.","Experts like the simple interface of the Magellan RoadMate 1200 because it makes it simple to navigate and input new information. They did mention that the Magellan RoadMate 1200 would be more useful with text-to-speech capabilities. Some consumers also thought that the Magellan RoadMate 1200 was slow to calculate routes, although the majority of consumers are still satisfied with the Magellan RoadMate 1200’s performance.","You don’t have to be overwhelmed by all the choices when buying a navigation GPs device for the first time. The Magellan RoadMate 1200 is proof that a GPS unit can be both affordable and simple to use while still giving great service."]},"id":"ea90f69f-7234-4329-ad52-b53f762c5146","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_23295","url":"/magellan-980-0054-001-20659-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"suzanne-humphries","url":"/author/suzanne-humphries","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Suzanne Humphries","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"5Cbzn8X4VHCDchbqEBVidP","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2008-08-06T06:00:00Z","datePublished":"2008-08-06T06:00:00Z","name":"Magellan RoadMate 1200 980-0054-001","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.","review":{"rating":51,"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2008-08-08T21:05:39Z","id":"sENznuKLHnEHBXawe8WBg9","meta":{"title":"Magellan 980 54 1 Review 2017 | Specs","description":"The Magellan RoadMate 1200 keeps you on the right track."},"products":[{"slug":"magellan-roadmate-1200-980-0054-001","url":"/product/magellan-roadmate-1200-980-0054-001","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:14:03Z","name":"Magellan RoadMate 1200 980-0054-001","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:14:03Z","id":"7WZTK5ZdxgRkMt52tEwFCY","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-17T22:14:04Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/7ECwK6B2PGhRsfoADzMdh8.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:14:03Z","mimeType":"","name":"ce20659.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/ce20659.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:14:03Z","id":"7ECwK6B2PGhRsfoADzMdh8","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ECwK6B2PGhRsfoADzMdh8.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Magellan 980 54 1 Review 2017 | Specs","description":"The Magellan RoadMate 1200 keeps you on the right track."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/7ECwK6B2PGhRsfoADzMdh8.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:14:03Z","mimeType":"","name":"ce20659.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/ce20659.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:14:03Z","id":"7ECwK6B2PGhRsfoADzMdh8","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ECwK6B2PGhRsfoADzMdh8.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Magellan 980 54 1 Review 2017 | Specs","description":"The Magellan RoadMate 1200 keeps you on the right track."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/gps/best-navigation-gps/magellan-980-0054-001-20659-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"electronics","url":"/electronics","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:14:03Z","name":"Electronics","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:14:03Z","id":"Wz8jKSaABzmDXaUadmQaDm","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"gps","url":"/electronics/gps","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T22:14:03Z","name":"GPS","dateModified":"2019-04-17T22:14:03Z","id":"PaNWioUkFhvsXZKxXS5PLR","dateImported":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
