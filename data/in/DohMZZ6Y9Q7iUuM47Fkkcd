Less time spent taking notes and filling out charts means more time to help patients. One way doctors are increasing efficiency is with <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-voice-recognition-software/\">voice recognition software</a>.","Using voice recognition software, a doctor can dictate notes about three times faster than typing them into a word processor, and with a 99 percent accuracy rate. This allows more time spent diagnosing and treating patients. It also creates a digital record of a patientÂ s history that is searchable, which means less time spent searching countless paper documents.","Voice recognition software was recently implemented by the U.S. Military. Before voice recognition, military doctors would dictate notes and submit them to a service for transcribing. This process could take two or three days at a cost of about 17 cents per line. In 2008, voice recognition software was purchased and distributed to 42 military facilities around the world. This has greatly improved efficiency and military officials believe the software will pay for itself in less than a year thanks to the offset in transcribing costs. This also creates more time for military medical personnel to spend treating soldiers and their families.","Voice recognition software has improved significantly in the past decade allowing developers to target specific professional markets. Voice recognition software was once considered to be sluggish and unreliable, but now is proving to be an invaluable asset in many industries. The medical industry is just the first. Soon we will see voice recognition technology and dictation software appearing in offices worldwide.","To find the best voice recognition software, see the side-by-side comparison of voice recognition programs or <a href=\"https://www.business.com/categories/best-voice-recognition-software/\">consult the accuracy test</a> we performed on those programs."]},"id":"7f858b59-883a-4880-b4fd-612a27658c16","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_845","url":"/voice-recognition-thrives-in-medical-industry","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"nicholas-dragon","url":"/author/nicholas-dragon","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Nicholas Dragon","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qbbNbwhZUCWtNJnrxdPUXM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2009-04-28T22:15:39Z","datePublished":"2009-04-28T22:15:39Z","name":"Voice Recognition Thrives in Medical Industry","synopsis":"Medical professionals are always looking for ways to improve efficiency.
