This safe step tub includes a wide swinging door that makes it easy for you to slide over from your wheelchair to the 22-inch-high seat even without help. With features like this, the AmeriGlide walk-in bathtub can help you maintain your independence in your own home.","The step up into the tub is actually higher than most walk-in tubs at 15 inches, but it isn&#39;t an issue with a model like this AmeriGlide. Even if you aren&#39;t wheelchair-bound, a walk-in tub with an outward-swinging door can be useful, because when you open the door, you have direct access to the seat. You simply sit in the tub, swing your legs in, close the door and start your bath. The <a href=\"/kohler-review\">Kohler Elevance Rising Wall</a> is another, more affordable, wheelchair-accessible soaker tub.","This handicap tub includes the usual safety features, such as a textured floor to prevent slipping and grab bars to make it easier for you to enter and exit the tub. With the extra grab bar on the door, you can easily close the door once you&#39;re seated inside. The size of this tub is similar to a standard bathtub at 60 x 30 inches, so it fits in a standard bathtub alcove. This AmeriGlide walk-in tub holds less water than most walk-in tubs at 65 gallons, but it&#39;s still deep enough for a relaxing soak.","You can add features to this basic soaker tub to make your bathing experience more pleasant. For instance, you can get it with air jets, water jets or both. The cost of this safe step tub goes up with added features, though. If you choose a whirlpool system, you get six adjustable water jets and a heater, which maintains your bathwater&#39;s comfortable temperature.","The stainless steel frame is strong with a 10-year warranty. The tub itself, which is made of reinforced fiberglass, is also covered by a 10-year warranty. Its high-gloss gel coat makes it easy to clean. As with most walk-in tubs, the door seal has a lifetime warranty. If you get the tub with jets, the pump and motor are protected by a five-year warranty."]},"id":"15e40adb-0b9d-4016-83c0-c6cb175687bd","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_60685","url":"/ameriglide-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"j-d-chadwick","url":"/author/j-d-chadwick","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"J.D.
