It is available in different sizes ranging from 10 by 15 feet to 30 by 60 feet.","The rectangular shape of this solar blanket makes it ideal for pools without curves. The material of the solar blanket is a low-density polyethylene resin. Overall, it is lightweight, but it is lighter in the middle than on the edges where it has strong seams. The heat-sealed edges create sturdy seams that can resist water ingress and splitting caused by high heat. Just as the seams make it durable, the cover&#39;s weight distribution ensures that it lays flat on the surface of a pool. The bigger Leslie pool covers may be too heavy and wide to handle by a single person. For these, you need a reel to quickly deploy and retract the solar pool cover. If you need a pool cover for odd-shaped pools this blanket’s sister product, the <a href=\"/best-solar-pool-covers\">Leslie’s 7-Year</a>, is a good option.","Regardless of the dimensions, all the blankets in this series are 10 mils thick. While this is sufficiently thick for solar pool covers, there are thicker blankets available, and those usually provide better insulation and heat retention. Like most solar covers, the underside of this solar blanket is covered with air bubbles. The bubbles create an insulating layer between the surface of the water and the air and, therefore, prevent heat loss caused by blowing winds. In addition, the blanket benefits from THERMO-TEX material, which is a layer that improves the blanket&#39;s ability to absorb and retain thermal energy much like a black pool cover.","Unlike a black blanket, the solar has a blue color that is transparent enough to allow the passage of sunlight, although with reduced efficiency compared to clear pool covers. Even then, Leslie&#39;s promises that this solar blanket reduces water evaporation by 95 percent and the cost of heating a pool by 70 percent. Although the THERMO-TEX resin used in this Leslie&#39;s pool cover increases the absorption of solar heat, the blanket itself has no UV protection. Without a UV-resistant film on its surface, the air bubbles and polyethylene resin material of the cover are susceptible to damage from UV rays.","The Leslie&#39;s 5-Year Solar Blanket with THERMO-TEX efficiently collects and stores thermal energy in order to keep a pool warm and lengthen the swimming season. However, it is a solar cover with no protection against UV damage."]},"id":"89b6330e-f646-4ca4-bad1-1b0946a61b43","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63264","url":"/leslies-5-year-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"grant-morgan","url":"/author/grant-morgan","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Grant Morgan","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"5h9THR5HH34dskUikqZYj8","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-05T20:06:40Z","datePublished":"2015-03-05T20:06:40Z","name":"Leslie's 5-Year","synopsis":"The Leslie's 5-Year Solar Blanket with THERMO-TEX is a rectangular solar cover for in-ground and indoor pools.
