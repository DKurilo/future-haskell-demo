The interface of this audio editing software is effective. It makes it possible for you to make edits in only a few minutes. There are two toolbars located beneath the menu bar, which runs horizontally across the top of the interface. The tools are buttons labeled with graphics, which do not have text titles. The graphics are easily distinguishable, and a text label pops up if you hover over the buttons.","Most of the expected effects are present – you can amplify, fade in and out, reverse, normalize, stretch, delay and do much more with your favorite music. You might miss some of the tools this product lacks, though, such as previews, a track splitter, variable playback speeds and the ability to burn CDs.","Easy Audio Editor has a pretty impressive lineup when it comes to recording capability. You can rip audio from a CD and extract audio from video files. You can even do something that is still rare in audio editing software – convert text to speech. This allows you to create documentaries, instructions or a variety of other unique projects that require speech.","Another nice thing about this audio editor is that you can record music from video files. The supported video formats are AVI (DivX, XviD, MS MPEG4, Uncompressed, Cinepak, etc.), MPEG (MPEG-1 and MPTEG-2 Video), WMV and Quick Time. Although this software package cannot burn CDs, the upgraded product by the same manufacturer, Music Editing Master, provides that capability.","Easy Audio Editor works with most uncompressed and compressed WAV files, including PCM, ADPCM, A-LAW, U-LAW, DSP, GSM and more. It can record the majority of files that play on a sound card, including CDs, DVD and audio from a line in. The recording options are easy to locate in the application and simple to change.","Easy Audio Editor includes all of the basic filters plus a band pass, FFT and a notch filter. It has a nice zoom feature and comprehensive help pages that cover every feature and tool the product offers. On the manufacturer&#39;s website, you can view FAQs and tutorials, and you can receive free updates for the application. These two links will connect you to all of the help and support resources DanDans Digital Media has created to assist its customers.
