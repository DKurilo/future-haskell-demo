The original review is below, but check out our current <a href=\"/best-electric-lawn-mowers\">Electric Lawn Mowers Reviews</a> here.</em>","At first glance, the GreenWorks G-MAX 40V, 20-inch Twin Force cordless lawn mower looks like a racecar with its angled design and large wheels, and although it looks bulky, it is easy to maneuver. The mower is made from a tough polymer that can take a beating while producing zero emissions, and it does this without tying you down with an electrical cord.Â ","The 20-inch wide cutting deck allows you to mow your lawn more efficiently by cutting down on the number of passes required to mow it. There is also a height-adjustment lever that lets you choose from five cutting heights, giving your lawn a smooth, polished, even look.","One of the best features of this electric lawn mower is that it comes with two 40-volt rechargeable batteries instead of just one. The two batteries, when they are fully charged, last up to 70 minutes when used in tandem, plus the mower has an automatic switchover function that keeps the motor running when it switches over from the drained battery to the charged one. The included charger only charges one battery at a time, but with this mower&#39;s long run time, you can easily mow a yard up to a 1/3 acre or more in size.","In addition to its long battery life, the G-MAX 40V features GreenWorks&#39; automatic power-adjusting system. This system monitors the power needed to cut your lawn and adjusts the battery accordingly to extend the mower&#39;s run time. In addition, the engine directs extra power to the dual blades to make quick work of thick grass.","This electric lawn mower features two oversized 10-inch wheels that help make the G-MAX 40V easy to maneuver. This is helpful, especially since the mower does not have a self-propel feature. You will have to use your own strength to push this lawn mower. If your yard consists of a steep grade or hills, you may want to consider another electric lawn mower with this feature.  Fortunately, though, it only weighs 42.5 pounds with an empty bag.","The G-MAX 40V cordless lawn mower can mulch your grass as you mow, which adds valuable nutrients back into your lawn, or you can opt to use the rear bag to collect the clippings. An airflow tab located on the bag tells you when the bag is full, eliminating any guesswork about when it needs emptying."]},"id":"04d34278-599e-4b36-9e8c-49f3f8bcf351","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"d9db019f-ba30-4d14-b717-a4caafc33578","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The GreenWorks G-MAX 40V electric lawn mower is an optimal mower for mid- to large- size flat lawns thanks to its long battery life and maneuverability.
