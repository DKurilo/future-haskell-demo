A supportive, quality pillow will cost between $60 and $80. Though this seems like a lot for a small item, the American Sleep Association and other experts encourage consumers to invest in a better pillow to help reduce snoring, alleviate neck and back pain, and improve the overall quality of sleep.","How often do you change your pillow?<br/>If you use a standard pillow from your local department store, experts suggest replacing your pillow at least every six months. This is because the filling becomes flat and unsupportive, the material holds body oils, and they generally aren’t mite deterrent.","Quality pillows, like the ones Top Ten Reviews has tested, are designed to last several years. Some include a 20-year warranty, like the <a href=\"/health/wellness/best-pillows/snuggle-pedic-review/\">Bamboo</a> by Snuggle-Pedic, or a lifetime warranty, like <a href=\"/health/wellness/best-pillows/nest-bedding-review/\">The Easy Breather</a> by nest bedding. These pillows are dust and mite resistant, and some are hypoallergenic. Also, the filling tends to hold its shape much longer because it’s made from memory foam. But even with a long warranty, the National Sleep Foundation still recommends replacing these pillows every 18 months or so.","Firm vs soft: Which pillow do I need?<br/>How hard or soft your pillow should be really comes down to personal preference. Through our testing we’ve found that most side sleepers tend to prefer the thicker, softer pillows while back sleepers like pillows that are more firm but thinner. We suggest looking for a pillow that fills in the gap between the bed and your head, filling the space around your neck and shoulders to give you enough support and help keep your back aligned properly."]},"id":"31d91af7-4501-44f0-9a55-f6807ecbd74e","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Related Product Reviews"},"id":"087d5216-10b2-4370-90b9-7e94cb4c48f7","type":"heading"},{"data":{"items":["<a href=\"/health/wellness/best-pillows/beckham-review/\">Beckham Hotel Collection Gel Pillow (2-Pack) -
