Rubber 9 Extreme, the long name for RB9X, is designed for ultimate traction even on slippery surfaces you may encounter on a trail, like wet rock when crossing a stream. This <a href=\"https://www.activejunky.com/articles/best-trail-running-shoes\">men&#39;s trail running shoe</a> features this RB9X traction-focused sole lined with multidirectional deep lugs.","Icebug Zeal2&#39;s EVA midsole – which is affectionately named HGMS2, aka Holy Grail Midsole Soft and Stable – is designed to provide support and stability while gently cupping the heel and reducing pressure on the Achilles tendon. Rather than typical separate insole construction, this foot-friendly midsole resembles competitive track footwear.","The upper is constructed with Kevlar fabric technology, which being in the family of bulletproof vest material, means that it is designed to be extremely durable without being ridged and uncomfortable. It remains soft and is lined for additional comfort. While the material is quick dry and non-absorbent, that does not equate to waterproof. However, the fabric will not be bogged down or add significant weight when wet.","High mileage runners who aren&#39;t slowed down or deterred by rocks, roots and other trail obstacles will appreciate Zeal2&#39;s control and extended longevity. The traction and stability in these trail running shoes from the combination of the RB9X out sole and HGMS2 midsole allow for confident freestyle trail running.","<strong>Active Junky Tester Comments: </strong>Well-suited for trail activities ranging from orienteering, obstacle courses and point-to-point mountain runs, the Zeal2 men&#39;s trail running shoes are geared toward competition with its attention to details in tandem with trail durability. Active Junky recommends running these lightweight trail running shoes fast and often.","<strong>Key Attribute:</strong> Innovation","<strong>Best For:</strong> Challenges on which others pass, trails that even hikers find daunting in addition to courses with high mental concentration coefficients.","<strong>Tech Specs:</strong>"]},"id":"fb375880-2b29-46a3-85fa-3e09d8d2ad2b","type":"text"},{"data":{"items":["Weight: 8.8 oz","Drop: 6 mm","Upper: Polyester Textile / PU","Midsole: EVA","Outsole: rubber – Icebug&#39;s Rubber 9 Extreme"],"type":"ul"},"id":"6244c9ed-e944-414f-ba6f-fa07461d7e5b","type":"list"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["<strong>Company Background:</strong> Based out of Sweden, Icebug launched in 2001 with a focus on innovation and technology.
