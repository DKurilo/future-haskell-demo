This is about seven times as many pixels as are in a typical high definition display this size. In our tests, the display reproduced 167 percent of the sRGB color gamut, and we consider just 100 percent to be impressive.    <br />\n  <br />\nThe 2017 update to the Mac means adaptable Thunderbolt 3 ports and better processing and graphics performance. The design has stayed the same though, with a black bezel and curved outer edges on the screen. One downside to this is the metal stand, which gives you a range of tilt but doesn’t give you very much freedom to adjust the height of the screen. At 20.8 pounds it’s also the heaviest of the computers we tested for home use. A total of nine ports are located on the back of the screen, along with the power button.  <br />\n  <br />\nThe technical specs of this computer are impressive. The iMac has a dedicated AMD Radeon Pro 580 graphics card with 8GB of VRAM. This configuration not only makes for superior graphics but effectively adds processing power compared to the use of an integrated graphics card on the CPU. Put simply, the Kaby Lake Intel Core i7-770K processor is fast. The iMac we tested, which retails for more than $2,000, also had a speedy 512GB solid-state drive. SSDs typically offer less storage than hard drives but are worthwhile because of the increased data access speeds they provide. These features essentially mean you can have several applications open and a multitude of webpages without seeing any slowdown in performance. There is, of course, a built-in webcam, and the package comes with a Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2, both of which feel great to use.","<a href=\"/apple-imac-21-5-inch-review\">Read the full review</a>"]},"id":"ad466898-9c17-481c-b472-7f0de8527fd2","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Best Value"},"id":"9ab7b4b4-59da-45fb-8a51-77da791cc56a","type":"section"},{"data":{"path":"/cYS4fyhtQi7V5pBBysQUG9.jpg","link":{"href":"/computers/desktops/best-home-computers/lenovo-ideacentre-review/","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":false,"importSrc":"http://media.bestofmicro.com/U/E/772214/original/Home-Computers-Lenovo-IdeaCentre-520S.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cYS4fyhtQi7V5pBBysQUG9.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"cYS4fyhtQi7V5pBBysQUG9","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cYS4fyhtQi7V5pBBysQUG9.jpg","alt":"Lenovo IdeaCentre 520S"},"id":"fa6523e6-b559-474b-aabc-65bb1c62c5e2","type":"image"},{"data":{"hawk":"{\"data-model-name\":\"Lenovo IdeaCentre 520S\",\"data-widget-type\":\"price\"}","linkText":"","url":"","specs":null,"subtitle":"","urlStyle":"","review":{"rating":60,"url":"/lenovo-ideacentre-review","name":"Lenovo IdeaCentre 520S","id":"924"},"noFollow":false,"title":"<a href=\"/lenovo-ideacentre-review\">Lenovo IdeaCentre 520S</a>","pros":["Large screen is still small enough for most desks","Has a 4K display","Display is a touchscreen"],"cons":["Audio isn’t great","Keyboard isn’t high quality","Ports are hard to access"]},"id":"60c8fb3f-ba76-44ae-a16c-92ac6e9287c0","type":"buying-guide"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The Lenovo IdeaCentre 520S is a lightweight computer with powerful internal components and a large 23-inch display.","This desktop model has high definition 1080p resolution, so while it's not going to be as crisp as computers with 4K and 5K displays, this Lenovo is still a great home computer.

It will do everything you need to browse the internet, watch videos and use common applications.      <br />\nOn the outside, this desktop has six rear-mounted ports that are honestly frustrating to access because they’re right behind the stand. The stand does give you a large range of tilting ability though, so you’ll have no problem showing your family the funny cat video you found.

Every model goes through a gambit of tests for speed, screen brightness and processing power. We have all the data to make sure you’re choosing the home computer that best meets your needs.","Derek Meister, a <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/geek-squad/pcmcat138100050018.c?id=pcmcat138100050018\">Best Buy</a> Geek Squad agent, said you should figure out what you want to use your computer for before you buy one, so think about what you want in performance, comfort, value and durability. He compared it to shopping for a car: If you have a large family, you’re going to need a minivan. If you want to go fast, you’ll need a sports car.","“Stop in a store and take the laptops for a test spin,” Meister said. “Some are comfortable, some are compact. Some of them have clicky keys and others feel like typing on a membrane. That feel is a lot more important than a lot of people expect.&#34;","Meister said people are using their smartphones and tablets more frequently when they’re out and about, so desktops have become a far more popular home computer option than they were around 2010. But whether you want a desktop or a laptop, how you’re going to use it is still the most important factor.","“You always want to get as much memory as you can afford and is reasonable, but I would look at the system as a whole,” Meister said.","Philip Michas built his first computer at 12 years old, has a degree in computer science and now owns <a href=\"http://slctechauthority.com/\">Tech Authority</a> in Salt Lake City, Utah. He recommends always buying a computer with a solid-state drive because they’re more likely to keep working if you – for instance – drop your laptop.","“Hard drives are mechanical things,” Michas said. “They’re spinning and moving and they don’t do well with shock.”","He also recommends sticking with higher-end processors. This typically means the higher the number, the better. Always avoid going any lower than an Intel i5 or equivalent AMD chip.","“For the more powerful user, go with a desktop,” Michas said.","<strong>How We Tested</strong>","We spent roughly 80 hours testing 10 different computers to see which ones were the best for using at home. This meant taking both laptops and desktops through a gambit of tests to check their speed, power and screen brightness along with our partners at Laptop Magazine and Tom’s Guide. We opened multiple programs and dozens of internet browser tabs to make sure these computers could handle doing a lot of work at once. We used 3DMark Fire Strike and 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited tests to evaluate graphics and gaming performance and then a color gamut test to measure each model’s ability to recreate color. The Geekbench test was used to test the computer’s processor and memory. On some models we even took typing tests to see how comfortable the keyboards are.","On laptop models, we made sure to use them in demanding, real-world scenarios. If a computer has a touchscreen, we tested how responsive it is. If it can be turned into a tablet with extra flexible hinges, we tested those too to make sure they worked. We also tested battery life by continuously using the internet until the battery was dead to give you a realistic expectation of how long you can expect to use the computer without needing to recharge.","<strong>Key Features to Look for When Buying a Home Computer</strong>","Speed &amp; Power<br/>If you think about a computer like a car, the processor is essentially the engine. They tend to have seemingly complicated names, so just keep in mind that generally a higher number means it&#39;s a faster and more powerful processor. The dominant manufacturers are Intel and AMD. Intel is better known but both make fine chips.","Another thing to look at is a computer’s RAM – random access memory – which is the internal space your computer uses to accomplish a task. Everything you open and every app you use requires your computer&#39;s RAM. Storage, on the other hand, is the measure of how much data can be saved on your computer. In short, Microsoft Word uses RAM but the document you save goes in your computer’s storage, whether hard drive or SSD. Having more RAM and storage is always a good thing but comes at a cost, so it’s important to make your purchase based on what you’re really going to use your computer for.","Aesthetics<br/>The old days of having a tower and monitor are slowly but surely coming to an end for most basic home computer desktops. For our comparison, we stuck to models that didn’t require an extra tower because we felt the average home user would rather have a compact unit. If you prefer, there are also a plethora of laptops that also work very well as a home computer, with the added bonus of portability. You can flip some laptops’ screens all the way around to turn your traditional L-shaped model into a flat tablet, which can be really fun for kids. Most of the computers we tested are lightweight and aesthetically modern with curved edges and a slim profile.","Your screen resolution is important because it’s what you’re going to spend your time looking at. While 1080p used to be the standard, now many computer companies are gravitating toward an even better 4K display. A computer with 1080p resolution has a horizonal resolution of 1,920 pixels, while 4K has a horizonal resolution of 4,096 pixels and 5K has a horizontal resolution of about 5,000 pixels. As usual, bigger numbers are better.","Cost<br/>You can buy a computer for work or personal use and pay anywhere from $300 up to several thousand dollars, depending on the hardware and peripherals you want. However, most options cost between $500 and $1,400 and offer you flexibility in design.","Asking for Help<br/>If you’re not a computer person, it’s best to simply ask for help. Whether you’re shopping at a big box store or a locally owned mom and pop place, the most expensive computer isn’t necessarily always the best. It’s important to let whoever you’re buying from know what you want out of your computer so they can give you the best buying advice. If being able to play online games is a priority, you’re going to want a different and probably more expensive computer than someone who just wants to use email and social media.","Track Pads<br/>If a laptop meets your needs, you should take a close look at the track pad. The track pad is the small space on the laptop&#39;s base you use to move the mouse around the screen.","Track pads are usually square and sit in the center or slightly off to one side. Using one is the best way to figure out which kind you prefer. In case you find a track pad is too sensitive or not sensitive enough, you can usually go into your computer&#39;s settings and make changes so it works better with the way you type and move your mouse. Track pads also allow you to control your computer with gestures. For example, you can swipe with more than one finger or moving in a specific way to open or close applications. You can also customize these commands on most laptops.","Accessories<br/>Once you select a home computer, you can start shopping for accessories. If you opt for a laptop but don&#39;t love the keyboard or audio package, you can always buy another and connect it.
