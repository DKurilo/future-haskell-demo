The original review is below, but check out our current top</em><i> </i><em><a href=\"http://cms.toptenreviews.com/electronics/home-entertainment/best-standard-dvd-players/\">Standard DVD Players</a></em><i> </i><em>here.</em>","Whether you love them or hate them, everybody knows Best Buy these days. As one of the largest vendors of consumer electronics in the United States, it comes as no surprise that they stock the shelves with their own brands and products. The Dynex DX-UPDVD2 is just one of these forays into the world of consumer electronics. Best Buy markets this DVD player as an economical alternative to more expensive DVD players with upconversion and HDMI connectivity; however with this unit they appear to have put economy before quality.","This DVD player is capable of playing and upconverting DVDs to near HD quality, so long as you connect it to an HDTV via an HDMI cable. That means that even your oldest low-res DVDs can look decent on a high-definition flat screen television. It will not have the same piercing quality of Blu-ray, but the picture will certainly win out against an older DVD player without the ability to upscale.","Best Buy endowed this upscaling DVD player with one great gift: an optical digital audio output. Optical cables are gaining popularity among audiophiles for rigging up home theater systems. Of all the DVD players we reviewed, The Dynex DX-UPDVD2 was the only one with an optical audio output.","There are a few drawbacks to consider, as well. For starters, it is not Energy Star approved, which means that it will be a bigger drain on your electricity. All other standard DVD players we reviewed consumed 11 watts or less. At 12 watts of power consumption, this product is the least energy-efficient of the lot. Though, just to keep things in perspective: 12 watts is more energy than other DVD players consume, but far less than most other electronics. Televisions routinely consume ten times the amount of electricity. If you are still watching an energy-hogging television, the extra watt or two from your DVD player will not make much of a difference. This DVD player&#39;s higher power consumption is only problematic if you have already optimized your whole system and are trying to keep your footprint as small as possible.","You will not find a USB or SD card slot either, so you won&#39;t be able to watch videos and photos directly from your digital camera or computer. Furthermore, it lacks an S-video connection in the back, which is not strictly necessary for most modern TV sets, but it could be a disqualifier if you are planning to connect any peripherals via S-video. Lastly, the 90-day warranty is below average. Most competitors offer one year of coverage on parts."]},"id":"45329592-39ea-4d4d-ab67-3186c4e87203","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"54f7314e-445f-47dc-8965-431c497f73fd","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With the exception of the digital optical output, the <strong>Dynex DX-UPDVD2 </strong>is just your run-of-the-mill inexpensive DVD player.

Many Blu-ray players are backwards compatible with DVDs, but they also come at a higher price.
