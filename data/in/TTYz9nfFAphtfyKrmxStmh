The trimmer head has dual line exits to double its cutting power. The weed whacker also comes with a trigger-control and bump-feed mechanism for new string, plus a debris shield to protect your feet and clothing.","This weed eater falls short of competing models in its attachment capabilities. Since this gas trimmer accepts no attachments, it is limited to chopping light weeds and tall grass. If you hold the grass trimmer at an angle, though, you might be able to edge your sidewalks and driveways. The <a href=\"/troy-bilt-gas-trimmer-review\">Troy-Bilt TB32</a> is one of several gas trimmers in our lineup that supports attachments. ","Perhaps the biggest shortcoming is the lack of anti-vibration technology.
