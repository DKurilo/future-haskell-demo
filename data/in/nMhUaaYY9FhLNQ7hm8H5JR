The Energy star rated air conditioner packs a powerful cooling punch. With 12,000 BTUs of power, this AC window unit is a good choice for a medium sized room of about 640 square feet. The energy efficiency ratio (EER) of this unit is a cool 10.8, so it&#39;s sure to cut on electricity costs. The unit has a special setting that can operate on a lower voltage,  so you can conserve energy and save money.","The eight-way direction control allows you to direct the airflow where you choose, regardless of where the window air conditioner is mounted, to give your room the right amount of cool all around. The multi-speed fan has three different settings, so you can adjust the cool depending on the time of day."]},"id":"b1805815-a537-4b1a-90ef-d142ecddcfab","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/cHiNPm5SGc6SJpUGwinoPn.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/57203-frigidaire-fra126ct11.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHiNPm5SGc6SJpUGwinoPn.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"cHiNPm5SGc6SJpUGwinoPn","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHiNPm5SGc6SJpUGwinoPn.jpg","alt":""},"id":"b5b1fddb-60e3-491a-946f-6155f3827932","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Electronic controls allow you to change the settings to your specific preference.

There is a filter alert that notifies you when the filter needs to be cleaned.","If you plan on having this AC unit in your bedroom, you&#39;ll appreciate the sleep mode that gradually increases your room&#39;s temperature throughout the night. However, this AC unit tends to be loud, so that&#39;s something to consider when deciding where the best place for this AC unit would be.","The Frigidaire FRA126CT1 comes with an easy-to-use installation kit and adjustable side panels that extend so you can fit them specifically to your windowâ€™s dimensions. This unit packs a powerful punch that cools a medium-sized room comfortably and will keep you feeling cool even on the hottest summer day.
