Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","What is the difference between one <a href=\"/best-hd-camcorders\">high definition video camera</a> and the next? It all comes down to the small specifications. While the<strong> </strong>Canon VIXIA HF S30<strong> </strong>has a good zoom and resolution, the small memory capacity is troublesome especially if you are planning on recording for extended periods of time in HD. Though the memory isn&#39;t as good as we would like to see, it does have a good still camera resolution.","When you hear HD you may not realize that there are still a lot of variables that can affect the quality of the video and the images. One of the first things we look at is the still camera resolution. We don&#39;t like the idea of needing to carry around two devices when one will work. This HDV camcorder has an 8MP camera that you can use to take still photos. We also liked the digital zoom of up to 200x. Some of the other specs we looked at included the focal length of 6.4-64mm and the LUX rating of 0.3. We expected a little more than the device&#39;s 24 Mbps recording speed. We liked to see at least 28Mbps because the higher the recording speed, the smoother the picture.","The memory for this HD video camera is the most disappointing aspect of an otherwise great product. When filming in HD it eats up a lot of memory quickly so the more memory you have, the longer you can record. The Canon VIXIA HF S30 only has 32GB of memory, giving you at most only 12 hours of recording time before you have to use a memory card or transfer some of your files. If you want to record in HD you will have closer to 3 hours.","Beyond the features we&#39;ve talked about – which are arguably the most important ones – a high definition camcorder should also include a number of additional features. One of the features we like to see with camcorders is an embedded GPS. The Canon VIXIA HF S30 doesn&#39;t come with this feature, which may not be a deal breaker for some, but it&#39;s a strike against it.","Thanks to its small physical dimensions, this HDV camcorder is pretty easy to bring with you anywhere you go. It is 3.1 inches high, 3 inches wide and 5.9 inches long. The Canon VIXIA HF S30 is compact and easy to carry around on all of your adventures. It weighs 18 ounces which is about average. There is a year warranty that covers manufacturing defects in the product. This can give you a little peace of mind, and if you want you can always purchase an extended warranty."]},"id":"bbbfdf75-8637-4b0b-84bd-8c2f29db5473","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"302a5cb1-acbe-4848-be1b-7791652f4830","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["With so many great HDV camcorders available on the market, you may be wondering what sets this one apart.
