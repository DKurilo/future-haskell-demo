You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The BlackBerry Storm 2 goes a long way to realizing the potential expected from the original release of the smartphone. You’ll likely recall, and the popular tech press has made it impossible to forget, that BlackBerry’s initial touch screen offering initially fell way short of just about everybody’s expectations. The biggest issues involved sluggish performance and responsiveness and were largely fixed by downloadable firmware updates. Still, you only get one chance to make a good first impression and the Storm missed it.","Enter the Storm 2. BlackBerry manufacturer RIM has taken great pains to listen to the complaints leveled against its predecessor and to fix them. The new device, while not perfect, will be a great choice for many consumers, especially those who demand BlackBerry’s industry leading messaging capabilities but like the benefits of a touch screen phone.","<strong>Standout Features</strong>","•\tWi-Fi<br/>•\tImproved SurePress user interface<br/>•\tUpdated BlackBerry Handheld Software 5.0 OS<br/>•\tDoubled memory"]},"id":"444860d6-9cd1-4bda-aa73-8e63f659df52","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Value"},"id":"ff26f175-1d05-4665-9074-0ded919ecf19","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The best reasons to choose a Storm 2 are the same reasons to want any BlackBerry. They continue to set the standards for messaging devices with true push email, seamless integration for enterprise users with MS Exchange, IBM Lotus Domino and Novell GroupWise as well as including up to ten separate IMAP/POP3 email accounts. High security and the ability to be tethered as a wireless modem are among other important attributes.  The Storm 2 is a world phone and includes a SIM card though it operates on Verizon Wireless’ CDMA network in North America. When traveling to other areas, it shifts seamlessly to GSM mode affording both voice and 3G data access in most countries.","The most news worthy improvement to the Storm 2 compared to the original is the improvement to the SurePress user interface. The concept is the same but the execution is much, much better. The idea behind SurePress is to provide positive, tactile feedback to the user when typing. The original keyboard was physically depressed to give a satisfying click response confirming the user’s actions. The problem was that the response was rather inconsistent across the screen and could be sort of sloppy as the screen moved. The new version offers the same click feel but is entirely electronic, i.e. the screen doesn’t actually move at all. It also allows for rolling over selections which highlights them for confirmation before pressing. The new screen also has some multitouch capabilities such as pressing the shift key and a letter to capitalize or touching the beginning and end of a selection for document editing. To that end, the device comes standard with the standard version of Documents-To-Go, from DataViz, for editing MS Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents, though an upgrade would be required for creating such documents. A full QWERTY keyboard is available in both landscape and portrait modes.","Our favorite addition to the Storm 2’s feature lineup is Wi-Fi. While recognizing that it operates on VZW’s extensive and fast EVDO Rev A network, Wi-Fi is still faster and the network isn’t absolutely always available. We just can’t agree with manufacturers’, or more likely wireless carriers’ decisions to omit it from high end phones, so we’re very pleased that it’s been made available.","Overall performance of the Storm 2 is greatly enhanced by the new BlackBerry 5.0 OS. The lag that plagued the original Storm is largely gone and the device’s performance is snappy and generally precise. The fact that onboard memory has been doubled doesn’t hurt performance either. The Storm 2 has 256MB of RAM and 2GB of onboard storage. Its storage is also enhanced by an included 16GB SDHC card and can be augmented with a card of up to 32GB capacity.","A critical feature of any touch screen phone will always be the display screen and the Storm 2 excels in this category.  With 480 x 360 pixel resolution, images are sharp and bright and video playback is a pleasure. At 3.25-inches diagonal measure, it’s smaller than the benchmark set by the <a href=\"/apple-apple-iphone-3gs-49330-review\">Apple iPhone 3GS</a> and improved on by the <a href=\"/motorola-droid-review\">Motorola Droid</a> but a fraction larger than that of the <a href=\"/palm-49311-review\">Palm Pre</a>.","The Storm 2’s camera has been upgraded to 3.2-megapixel resolution. It has an LED flash and includes video recording and playback capability. It has great media player capabilities and supports Bluetooth mono and stereo protocols. An integrated GPS/A-GPS receiver is included."]},"id":"5b3c91e0-d7f0-4aca-b62b-26ddbdeecd30","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Design"},"id":"d9c1c415-e35e-4098-8e68-74938240591e","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["We freely admit that we were somewhat less critical of the original Storm than many reviewers. While not pardoning the rush to market with substantial firmware glitches unresolved, RIM and Verizon Wireless did a pretty good job of resolving most of them with firmware updates in pretty short order.

It was intended to offer a better tactile experience than other touch screens and we reserve the right to have liked it despite what most of the press had to say.","But that’s history.
