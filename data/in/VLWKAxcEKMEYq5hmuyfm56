You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","Coby is a relatively well-known electronics manufacturer that has its hands in several different electronics markets, including LED TVs. Initially, we were impressed with the company&#39;s extensive selection of electronics, but once we reviewed its line of <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">LED TVs</a>, we decided that Coby might have been better off sticking to a handful of specialty products. We were quite disappointed by the performance of this TV, especially compared to some of our higher-ranked products.","The Coby LEDTV5526 has a full 55-inch display with local dimming capabilities and mostly average specifications apart from the contrast ratio; the LCD panel combined with LED backlighting and local dimming still only manages an absolutely atrocious 40,000:1 contrast ratio, which is well below modern standards and vastly inferior to the other LED TVs we reviewed. That said, the rest of this television&#39;s specs are relatively normal, and some are even moderately impressive (the TV stand is thinner than any other product on our lineup). Despite a few shining, positive features, the Coby LED TV remains one of the lesser sets in this comparison.","The features of the TV itself border on middle-grade to upper-echelon, but they lack a degree of horsepower that the higher-ranked TVs command. The display size of 55 inches places it squarely among the luxury models, but the stunning lack of others features – such as the abysmal contrast ratio and only barely average refresh rate – land it among the Geo Metros of the widescreen LED TV world.","Basic features make the Coby LEDTV5526 moderately attractive; the set consumes 175 watts of power in operation (roughly equivalent to other sets of similar size), and it has a set of two built-in 15W speakers that exceed the norm slightly. Meanwhile, even though these features are slightly redeeming, the incredibly poor specifications of the display – such as the pitiful 40,000:1 contrast ratio and only average 120Hz refresh rate – drag it down into the lower reaches of our comparison. We would like to see a manufacturer with a diversified product line do well in our lineup of the best LED TVs, but unfortunately, it seems Coby&#39;s eagerness to enter several markets has come at the cost of quality.","The warranty that Coby provides with this TV is also an underperformer; the set is only covered for parts and labor for 90 days, which is about one quarter of the warranty length offered by other manufacturers on our lineup. Telephone and email support are available for customer questions, which is a possibility given that Coby only offers a limited FAQs section and no online user manual."]},"id":"84b80ad0-7314-4e8f-91e8-07301d2661a3","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"4994e12c-810a-45d5-b537-95d481fc24b1","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["While the 55-inch screen size and middling features would earn this LED TV set at least an average ranking, a few exceptional drawbacks caused it to place lower in our lineup.
