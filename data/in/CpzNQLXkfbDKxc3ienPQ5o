These exercise devices let you choose from a large number of preset workouts as well many different resistance levels.","One of the elliptical machines in this line is the NordicTrack Front Drive E9.9. It offers a remarkable 30 workout programs, so you will never be bored with your exercise sessions. You can customize your exercise by employing one of 24 different resistance levels and adjusting the incline up to 20 degrees.","You also can adjust your stride between 20 and 22 inches, which is a key element in comfort and working specific muscle groups.","With the seven-inch backlit LCD display, you can easily track the duration of your workout, the number of calories burned, the distance covered and other factors that measure your exertion.<br/>You can track your heart rate by grasping the handles on the stationery bars or you can use the included chest strap. The chest strap more accurately monitors your heart rate.","One extra that you can have with this elliptical trainer is the chance to use the iFit technology, which costs an additional $99 for a year or $149 for two years. You can track as many as four user accounts. Some exercisers might balk at paying more, but many workout enthusiasts will no doubt delight in downloading fitness programs from a variety of professional trainers, including the celebrity Jillian Michaels.","You also can use iFit to create routes for &#34;running&#34; using Google maps and forget about your physical aches and pains as you breeze through the cyber world of streets, neighborhoods and communities. With this, you can basically take in a run anywhere – Paris, Tokyo, Honolulu – you name it.","You can run to music with this elliptical&#39;s speakers and plug-ins available for such things as MP3 players, and enjoy a breeze as you work up a sweat with the cooling fan. Unfortunately, there is no reading rack or water bottle holder on this elliptical machine.","This elliptical also does not include built-in warm up or cool down programs but you can always arrange to do those manually.","The flywheel on this elliptical trainer weighs 30 pounds, which is quite heavy compared to other elliptical trainers. This device is also quite large, measuring 68 inches long, 26 inches wide and 73 inches high. It weighs a hefty 250 pounds. This elliptical trainer can accommodate individuals who weigh as much as 350 pounds.","The frame comes with a lifetime warranty, while the warranty on parts are three years and labor is one year. You can contact the manufacturer by phone or email, and you can learn a great deal through online manuals and a FAQs section."]},"id":"a08bd4a6-26e9-4fef-a1f9-753b0a583e03","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"8c10327d-2925-4a48-8602-f0b38620b5b3","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The NordicTrack Front Drive E9.9 is a sturdy and worthwhile elliptical machine that can give you plenty of different workouts to achieve the fitness goals you have in mind."]},"id":"ab06e4a5-5fb5-4269-98e4-907e3e2eb33d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_58396","url":"/nordictrack-front-drive-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"jennifer-christensen","url":"/author/jennifer-christensen","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Jennifer Christensen","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"qX8C3ZuWD5WJi4xoRSY64e","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2013-12-10T21:11:47Z","datePublished":"2013-12-10T21:11:47Z","name":"NordicTrack Front Drive E9.9","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from viewing as part of this site because it has been replaced by another product.
