The HP Envy TouchSmart 23-d260qd is a great addition to any home with its elegant design that&#39;s sure to look great in any office or room.","This <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-all-in-one-pc,review-2159.html\">all-in-one PC</a> has a powerful processor with high speed, so you can watch movies and play games. Another great feature is the home PC&#39;s touchscreen that makes using the computer more enjoyable.","In general, all-in-one PCs are not ideal for gamers. However, the HP Envy TouchSmart can handle games fairly well. It&#39;s also capable of syncing with your Windows Live and Xbox Live accounts, making operation between systems dynamic."]},"id":"867e5c70-2791-40cf-a0c3-1812a42de4a0","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/QTC2yMd7VsAkQowEsdmdcV.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"The standout feature of the HP Envy TouchSmart is its 23-inch HD touchscreen.

If staying connected with family and friends is important, you’ll appreciate the fact that the included webcam records HD video for video conferences. Finally, this Envy is one of the few computers we reviewed with a Blu-ray drive standard in the unit.","Like many all-in-one PC manufacturers, HP offers optional features that raise the initial costs, but for the Envy the list of options is much smaller.  All of the essential components come standard with this Envy, and we appreciate seeing a product that gives you everything up front without trying to nickel and dime you later. Of the additional features, you can buy a TV tuner or an HDMI input option. However, these would only be useful if you&#39;re trying to replace your home television. Even without those options, the Envy TouchSmart is a top entertainment hub and a fantastic all-in-one PC.","The only downside of the Envy is its lack of USB ports: There are only two 3.0 USB ports. If you use USB devices, like an external hard drive, flash drive or MP3 player, you&#39;ll have to manage your plugs far more than with other all-in-one PCs we reviewed. Fortunately, this is only a problem if you have several USB-based devices. If you plan on primarily using Windows 8 apps or surfing the web, the lack of inputs and outputs will not take away from the overall functionality of the HP Envy TouchSmart. ","HP offers one of the best warranties we&#39;ve seen with two years for parts and labor. On top of this warranty, the computer is preloaded with HP Support Assistant, a program designed to connect you with the help you need while using your computer.","If you&#39;re not able to get the help you need from the computer itself, customer service representatives are available through telephone or email. HP lists an online chat feature, but whenever we tried to use it, the service would redirect us back to the support page. Once this is fixed, it becomes one more option to get help from a person.","However, if you don&#39;t need a person to hold your hand through your problems, the support site&#39;s FAQs and driver downloads are easy to find and use. The list of troubleshooting options will help you feel like a computing pro, but if the self-help guides are not working, you still have customer service and a two-year warranty to fall back on. HP offers one of the most comprehensive support systems we have seen from a company."]},"id":"5c986872-b54d-4d06-969a-8e103bb0f497","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"6e391ddd-4cca-4a16-b5f9-de7514115b7f","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["The HP Envy TouchSmart 23-d260qd handles any program you throw at it, and as an entertainment hub, this one rivals home televisions.
