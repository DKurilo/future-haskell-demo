Note: DxO Optics Pro is now DxO PhotoLab. This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been replaced by another product. You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","DxO OpticsPro 10 is easy-to-use photo editing software that provides both a photo organizer and editing tools. The interface has two modes: Organize and Customize. A variety of basic and advanced editing tools can be found under the Customize tab.","This photo editor for Mac has basic editing tools such as move, zoom and crop. You can alter the colors of your images using the color management feature, or you can apply creative filters to the photos. OpticsPro has over 30 creative filters you can choose from that alter the texture and color of your image. The program offers automatic edit options that help immensely when you are first learning how to edit photos.","In addition to the standard editing tools, the <a href=\"/best-mac-photo-editing-software\">Mac photo editor</a> has several advanced editing capabilities. For instance, the program creates HDR images from two or more of your photos. You also can use layer masks, correct lens distortions, and adjust highlights and shadows with this software. It also features batch processing, so you can apply these edits to multiple photos at once.","While this software offers a selection of both basic and professional editing tools, it lacks several that improve usability. The program doesn’t have some of the basics like red eye removal, selection and layer creation tools. While these serve as convenience features, they make editing your photos easy.","The software also lacks makeover tools, vector graphic tools, adjustment layers and cloning tools. Without these professional tools, you are limited in the level of edits you can make, so this software is more suitable for beginners.","The Organize tab holds the software’s built-in photo organizer, which you can use to keep track of your photos. The organizer displays thumbnails of your photos with their EXIF information in the bottom panel of the interface. You can organize your photos by folders, keywords or ratings and then use the advanced image search to find them.","The software supports JPG, TIGG and DNG file formats when exporting your images. While this limits the files and programs you can use to supplement this software, it does support RAW image files, so you can upload photos from most cameras.","In addition to exporting your images, you can also share them online. This picture editor for Mac posts your photos on social media sites or to emails directly from the program. This feature helps save time when sharing your photos.","DxO OpticsPro has several different support options you can use. Between the video tutorials, FAQs page and user forum, you can find answers to most of your questions. If you need further help, you can use the live chat option or email a technical support representative. When we sent inquiries, we found that DxO was quick to respond and very helpful."]},"id":"1b6cc1d9-9b02-48a6-ac11-015a23df8145","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"926ad64e-1895-43cb-8bd3-57688739f616","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["DxO OpticsPro serves as good Mac photo editing software.
