This pot offers all the features of a traditional <a href=\"/best-fondue-pots\">fondue set</a>, which has its charm and its drawbacks.","This cast-iron fondue set offers a fun way to prepare cheese dips, meats, entrees, hors d&#39;oeuvres and chocolate dips for fruits. It is also a versatile fondue set that allows you two different ways to heat and make your favorite fondue. This pot also allows you to make different types of fondue instead of including a specified pot for each type of fondue you make.","The sleek red and black design adds a touch of style to this fondue set, which features a red enameled exterior and white enameled interior. The fork holder is coated with red enamel, while the cast-iron stand and chrome burner are both painted black.","The chrome burner runs on a single gel pack rather than electricity, but you can also use the pot on induction and ceramic cooktops. This may be inconvenient for you, because the fondue is not continuously heated during the pot&#39;s use. Since this pot requires a burner, you will spend extra money heating the unit, but you will also get to experience what it was like using a fondue pot when they were first introduced.","This fondue set comes complete with a cast-iron pot and fork holder, cast-iron stand, chrome burner and eight color-coded chrome forks with plastic handles. It holds up to 5.3 cups of fondue and is hand-washable. It&#39;s easy to wash by hand but is not dishwasher safe, which would make cleanup quicker and easier. The color-coded forks are helpful if you are hosting a fondue party. The different colors make it easy to keep track of which fork belongs to which guest. You can purchase accessories, such as extra forks, separately to maximize your use of this fondue set and allow more people to participate in the fun.","The Crate and Barrel Cast-Iron Fondue Set gives you a taste of the early days of the fondue trend, as it is a traditional pot that runs on a gel pack. This also means you will have to keep buying gel packs to keep it running and therefore have to plan ahead to use it at parties. The eight color-coded forks are very handy for parties, though."]},"id":"6bc16d30-ff0a-4d70-8c41-038fb99d8c5d","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_61614","url":"/crate-barrel-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"top-ten-reviews-staff","url":"/author/top-ten-reviews-staff","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Top Ten Reviews Staff","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"EcXXb3s8QKwvex3rQshgX5","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2014-12-16T17:18:03Z","datePublished":"2014-12-16T17:18:03Z","name":"Crate & Barrel Cast Iron Fondue Set","synopsis":"The Crate and Barrel Cast-Iron Fondue Set is a stylish addition to any kitchen.
