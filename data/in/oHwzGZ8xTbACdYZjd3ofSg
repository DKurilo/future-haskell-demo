Though the two phones share similar technical specs, the 6T has some major improvements over its predecessor. Most impressively, the 6T is the first smartphone available in the U.S. with an in-display fingerprint sensor. In testing, the fingerprint sensor worked quickly and accurately, especially in conjunction with the 6T’s facial recognition unlock. The 6.41-inch AMOLED display is beautiful and features a tiny notch in the top center, which houses the phone’s 16MP front camera. The all-glass back holds the dual 16MP and 20MP shooters. Though the phone is constructed entirely of glass, it can't charge wirelessly. However, it kept the previous iteration's superfast quick-charging capabilities, which only require its included charging accessories. The most disappointing difference between the 6 and 6T is the latter’s lack of a headphone jack.    <br />\n  <br />\nEven though the company consistently produces great budget phones, three main issues prevent the OnePlus from being a major contender. First, the phones still aren’t IP rated against water damage. Second, the OnePlus phones lag behind other devices in camera quality. Lastly, OnePlus phones could previously only be purchased through the company's own store, though the OnePlus 6T is now available exclusively through T-Mobile.

Although the Pixel 3 features a single rear shooter instead of two like most flagships, it still takes incredible photos thanks to smart software, including Top Shot and Super Res Zoom features. The first takes several shots and chooses the best option, and the second keeps photo details sharp, even when you zoom in. The front camera has two lenses, including a wide-angle option for group selfies. The Call Screen feature uses Google Assistant to screen your calls so you don’t waste time answering robocalls. And while both are major selling points for the device, the Pixel 3 functions spectacularly even without the gimmicks.

The downside to these larger phones is that they cost more.","Camera<br/>Any flagship smartphone camera from the last few years can snap high-quality photos. We spoke with Nicolas Touchard of DxOMark Image Labs – a company that independently benchmarks smartphone cameras and is considered the authority on smartphone camera rankings – to gather information on the most important things to consider when you shop.","“There is a huge range of features you can get in a smartphone camera, so you first have to think through what kind of photos you want to take,” he told us. If you want the best camera for portraits, for example, a portrait mode or focus that blurs the background to make the subject pop can take your smartphone photography to the next level. Some cameras do this using dual lenses, while others apply bokeh filters. Some smartphones can use this or a similar setting with both the rear and the front camera. If you frequent dimly lit locations and want to preserve those moments, look for a smartphone with a camera that takes good photos in low light.","Once you know the camera feature set you want, Touchard advises reading reviews and rankings to find the smartphone with the best camera and other features you need that’s within your budget. DxOMark has thorough reviews of both front and back cameras for new smartphones."]},"id":"4561bf79-215b-4710-b106-605a940d5f25","type":"text"},{"data":{"path":"/TMNWzhKHrVJmPWVNKJa5QD.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"https://img.purch.com/mobile-phones/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9SL1YvODEyMjk5L29yaWdpbmFsL1NtYXJ0cGhvbmVzLVRlc3RpbmctMDAyLkpQRw==","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TMNWzhKHrVJmPWVNKJa5QD.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"TMNWzhKHrVJmPWVNKJa5QD","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TMNWzhKHrVJmPWVNKJa5QD.jpg","alt":""},"id":"82abb511-21fb-4a93-832e-7bcc0fe3216b","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Price<br/>","It’s not uncommon for a top-of-the-line smartphone to cost $1,000, thanks to the precedent set by Apple’s iPhone X in 2017. Many good or great smartphones cost much less, but current-generation devices from popular lines, such as iPhones, Samsung Galaxy S-series and Google Pixels, are undoubtedly pricey. These phones are classified as flagship smartphones – the best a manufacturer has at any given time. To compare apples to apples, we only evaluate flagship smartphones. With relatively few major innovations in the last few years, flagship features are found in a range of devices costing from $500 to over $1,000. However, a few things indicative of this price tier are incredible cameras and beautiful OLED displays.","Right below flagship phones are the mid-tier options, though the distinction between the two categories is blurred. Flagship phones that are a generation or two old are categorized as mid-tier, as they often cost much less than current-gen flagships. There are also many smartphones available at a mid-tier price, which covers a wide range from $100 to around $500.","Budget phones cost less than $100 and are reminiscent of early touchscreen phones. They function well with a basic camera, internet connectivity and media capabilities, but they don’t stand up to flagship phones in build quality. Budget phones are often available from prepaid phone carriers.","Water-Resistance<br/>To assess water-resistance and durability, look at the IP rating. An IP rating, or Ingress Protection, is usually displayed as something like “IP67.” This is a combined score. The first number is the device’s dust rating. A six is the highest score, ensuring complete protection against dust ingress, so even if dust gets into your phone, it won’t kill it. The second number is the water rating, with eight being the highest score. Most smartphones we tested have either IP67 or IP68 ratings, which equate to total protection against dust and some submersion in water. Note that water-resistant isn’t the same as truly waterproof. Phones are now better equipped for brief dips than in the past, but they’re not waterproof enough to go swimming with you.","<br/>iPhone or Android<br/>Choosing an Android or iOS device is entirely up to your personal preference, as each operating system has its pros and cons.","Apple’s iOS has a reputation for being more streamlined and user-friendly. It’s not super customizable, and it’s only available on iPhones, which are among the most expensive smartphones available. When it comes to privacy, iOS uses Differential Privacy, which anonymizes collected data. The Apple Ecosystem is less compatible with outside devices, though Apple-branded products work wonderfully together.","Android, the OS that every other phone uses, is your only option when it comes to budget phones, with options in every smartphone tier. It’s more customizable and therefore might take a little tweaking to find the optimal settings and setup for you. Google, which runs Android, collects more personal data than Apple to personalize your experience. Some smartphone manufacturers alter the Android OS to work better with specific devices, like the OnePlus 6 and it’s Android Oreo-based Oxygen OS.","<strong>Should You Insure Your Smartphone?</strong>","A new smartphone is an expensive investment, and paying for a device protection plan through the manufacturer, your wireless carrier or a third party adds a layer of security that can save you hundreds of dollars, especially if you’re prone to phone-related accidents. However, it can also cost more money than it’s worth if you don’t read the fine print or consider the costs beyond your premium. Many plans limit the number of claims you can file within a certain time period, many do not cover device loss or theft, and some have fairly high deductibles for repair or replacement services. Overall, deciding whether or not to insure your phone depends a lot on your situation. Though it’s impossible to know the future, you probably have a good guess about whether you’re at high risk of needing smartphone repairs or replacement. If you’re around young children a lot or have a history of dropping or losing phones, then it’s probably worth the extra cost. If you can afford to outright replace your phone if something should happen and don’t have a record of losing or breaking phones, insurance may be a waste of money.","The best way to decide what, if any, protection plan to buy for your phone is to read all the fine print and compare costs. Let’s say you just bought an iPhone XR from Verizon. Your protection choices include Verizon’s three tiers of plans, the two plans available from AppleCare+ and third-party protection plans like those available through SquareTrade. If you drop your XR and need to replace the screen, you&#39;ll pay $199 out of pocket to have it fixed through Apple. With Verizon’s $6.75 per month Wireless Phone Protection, your deductible for screen repair is just $29. It’s the same deductible for Verizon’s $9 Total Equipment Coverage plan and $13 Total Mobile Protection plan as well. With AppleCare+’s plans, the deductible is $29 as well, but the monthly premium costs $7.99 or $12.99, depending on whether your plan includes protection against theft and loss. SquareTrade’s deductible can be as low as $25 or up to $199, depending on where you live. In this case, Verizon’s cheapest plan saves the most money, but you must also consider that you can only make three claims per year.<br/><strong><br/>Huawei</strong>","Huawei is the world’s second-largest smartphone manufacturer, following Samsung. Many people in the U.S. are unfamiliar with the Chinese company because Huawei phones are not sold through U.S. wireless carriers. In early 2018, both AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless were considering partnerships with Huawei but decided against the move. Huawei phones, like the Mate 20, are available unlocked online through stores like Amazon and Newegg, but these options don’t allow for financing and require the full cost of the phone upfront. The result is that American consumers largely miss out on some great devices.","Huawei is scarce in the States because U.S. officials worry that the Chinese company could use its technology to allow the Chinese government to spy on the U.S., posing a security risk. Huawei makes phone network equipment as well as smartphones, and concerns about the former have tainted the latter. There are concerns that Huawei could sabotage the infrastructure at a later date if its equipment is included in the network, even if everything is inspected and improves initially. Huawei denies the possibility and filed a lawsuit against the U.S. in early March 2019 for banning its network equipment sales in the country, which isn’t yet resolved.","<strong>New And Noteworthy</strong>","Pixel 3 Lite<br/>The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are both high-end smartphones, and they have price tags to match. Google’s rumored Pixel 3 Lite is set for release around spring 2019. It’s a mid-range phone that’s speculated to cost around $400 to $500. According to the same rumors, the Lite features the same spectacular camera setup on the Pixel 3 and probably even features a 3.5mm headphone jack.","Samsung Galaxy Fold<br/>Samsung announced its long-awaited foldable phone at the Unpacked event on February 20th. The foldable smartphone launches on April 26th and has a starting price of $1,980 in the U.S. The hybrid phone/tablet features dual 4.6- and 7.3-inch displays and can run three apps simultaneously in tablet mode. The tablet screen uses Samsung’s Infinity Flex Display supported by an interlocking-gear hinge. The Fold has a triple camera rear system and a 10 MP front camera. It uses a 7nm Qualcomm processor with 12 GB RAM and 512 GB storage.","Samsung Galaxy S10<br/>Samsung also recently unveiled its Galaxy S10 smartphones. The line includes four smartphones: the S10, S10 Plus, S10e and S10 5G. The first three S10s  are on the market as of March 8th. The 5G phone doesn’t have an official release date, but it’s expected later this year. The known starting prices for the new phones are $749.99 for the S10e, $899.99 for the S10 and $999.99 for the S10 Plus, though the price climbs up to $1,599.99 for the maxed out, 1 TB storage option on the S10 Plus. The premium price tags come with equally premium features, however, including a larger display, better camera hardware and software, an in-display fingerprint scanner, more color options, an advanced Snapdragon 855 processor, 8 to 12 GB of RAM, support for Wi-Fi 6, Android 9 Pie and a large-capacity battery. Favorite features, including IP68 water resistance, expandable storage and a 3.5mm headphone jack, remain.","Nokia 9 PureView<br/>During MWC 2019 in Barcelona, Nokia announced its new five-camera smartphone, the Nokia 9 PureView. Unlike other multi-camera phones, the PureView uses all five lenses at once to capture an image and combines the five images into one photograph. This creates amazing photos with exceptional color and detail. The device uses last year’s Snapdragon 845 processor, has 6GB of RAM, 128 GB of storage, an IP67 water rating and a 3,320 mAh battery.","Huawei Mate X<br/>Huawei announced the Mate X in Barcelona during MWC 2019. The foldable phone features an 8-inch main display that folds around the outside of the device to transform it into a dual-screen phone with a 6.6-inch front display and 6.4-inch rear display. The phone has three lenses on its main, rear shooter that you can also use for taking selfies, thanks to the phone’s back display. It uses a Huawei’s Kirin 980 processor, has dual-SIM capabilities and a 4,500 mAh battery. The hybrid phone and tablet release later this year for about $2,600 (converted from Euros), and it includes 5G capabilities.","LG V50 ThinQ<br/>The V50 ThinQ is LG’s first 5G phone. It uses the Snapdragon 855 chipset, has 6 GB of RAM, 128 GB of internal storage, a 4,000 mAh battery and expandable storage. It looks very similar to the V40 ThinQ and has a similar camera setup. The V50 ThinQ addresses 2019’s foldable phone trend with a separate add-on screen, though this component is not scheduled for release in the U.S. until this summer.","LG G8 ThinQ<br/>The LG G8 was announced at MWC 2019, but LG hasn’t announced a release date or pricing information. The device is equipped with the latest Snapdragon 855 chipset, 6 GB of RAM, 128 GB of storage, expandable storage, a 3,5000 mAh battery and a 3.5mm headphone jack. These specs put it in line with other Androids released this year. The main thing that sets the G8 apart is the phone’s front-facing 3D camera that allows for two new features: Air Motion and Hand ID. Air motion allows you to interact with your phone without touching it by gesturing above the screen, and Hand ID is a different type of biometric unlock that uses a 3D palm scan. Both features sound gimmicky, but we reserve judgement for hands-on testing.","Sony Xperia 1<br/>The Xperia 1’s 6.5-inch, 4K HDR OLED display has a 21:9 aspect ratio, which makes it longer and thinner than other phones on the market. In landscape orientation, the ratio is the same as most movies, which makes watching movies on the Xperia 1 a more enjoyable experience. The phone uses the Snapdragon 855 chipset, 6 GB of RAM, 128 GB of storage, expandable storage up to 512 GB and a 3,330 mAh battery. Its release is expected in Q2 of 2019, and it is set to cost over $1,000.","OnePlus 7<br/>Chinese phone maker OnePlus usually produces two phones per year, the main upgrade in the spring and a T version in the second half of the year. While OnePlus had a demo version of its upcoming 5G phone at MWC 2019, very little information is confirmed about the OnePlus 7. We know the 7 and the 5G phone are separate models and the 7 doesn’t support wireless charging. Rumors and leaks suggest that the OnePlus flagship phone stays in line with the company’s lower-than-average prices, uses a Snapdragon 855 chipset, triple rear cameras and a possible pop-up selfie cam.","Samsung Galaxy Note 10<br/>Samsung’s Galaxy S10 phones were recently released, and the rumors have already started about the upcoming Galaxy Note 10. The biggest difference between the two devices is that the Note 10 uses UFS 3.0 storage, while the S10 line devices all use three-year-old UFS 2.1 tech. UFS 3.0 is both faster and more efficient, which equals better performance and a longer battery life. It is also speculated that the Note 10 features four rear cameras. The addition of 5G compatibility is definitely a possibility for a mid-year phone, especially since Samsung plans to release the 5G-capable version of the S10 in June."]},"id":"076120fe-691c-45cb-a75f-ccd9c9901aa2","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"en_US_43_Review_359","url":"/best-smartphones","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"rebecca-armstrong","url":"/author/rebecca-armstrong","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","name":"Rebecca Armstrong","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:44:31Z","id":"6pCy2z6qSDBXrw3J9gsMqa","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2019-03-19T17:08:00Z","datePublished":"2019-03-19T17:08:00Z","name":"Best Smartphones of 2019","synopsis":"We test a phone's display, processor, camera, and battery life multiple times under identical conditions.
