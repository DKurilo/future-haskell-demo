Though some traditional monitors are able to connect to Skype for long-distance monitoring, Wi-Fi systems have a decided advantage, as they allow you to monitor from anywhere on most wireless devices.","Certain features such as pan, tilt, zoom and two-way talk have become more common on traditional baby monitors, but have been a little slower to make their way to Wi-Fi monitors. WiFi Baby doesn&#39;t have two-way talk or pan and tilt, but it does have a zoom function and a generously wide view.","When your baby is small, this won&#39;t be a major factor, but the more mobile your baby becomes, the more you will want to follow him around the room. If you buy additional cameras and want to monitor an older sibling in the next room, for instance, pan and tilt may be more of an important factor to consider. The wall-mounting option helps make up for this omission by giving you a nice viewing angle that encompasses the entire room.
