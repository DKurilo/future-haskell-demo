The original review is below, but check out our current top 10 about </em><a href=\"/best-weed-whackers\"><em>Weed Whackers here</em></a><em>.</em>","Tanaka Power Equipment provides premium-quality consumer products and is known for its line of grass trimmers. Representing Tanaka in our comparisons is the Tanaka TBC-260SF, a straight-shaft weed whacker with a two-cycle engine. This premium trimmer has a flexible design, four optional attachments and great customer service, including the best warranty in our lineup.","The Tanaka TBC-260SF is easy to handle and has an effective design. The 23.9cc two-stroke engine is a big reason that this weed trimmer weighs in at 13.4 pounds. This is a couple pounds heavier than the lightest weed eater in our lineup is, but it also means that the components of the machine are stronger and more durable.","To complement the engine&#39;s quality, Tanaka has included an enormous 23-ounce fuel tank on this gas trimmer. A large fuel tank means you&#39;ll be able to tackle large projects with ease. For the engine to work properly, you&#39;ll need to mix oil and gas before filling the fuel tank. An anti-vibration feature on this tool protects you from muscle fatigue as you work and after you put the trimmer away.","The trimmer head that comes with this weed whacker has a debris shield and bump-type line feed. A bump feed allows you to tap the ground to replace worn trimmer line while you work without turning off the engine to advance the line manually. This Tanaka weed eater also has an adjustable handle to assist users of various heights.","This yard trimmer is compatible with four optional SmartFit attachments: an edger, a pole saw, a cultivator and a hedge trimmer, plus a shoulder strap. All of these tools are essential to perfect landscaping and it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll ever need anything more than these attachments. However, the unit does not have any brush cutter, sweeper or blower attachments.","Tanaka has so much confidence in the quality of its workmanship that it offers an unrivaled seven-year warranty. This only gets better with an additional lifetime warranty that covers the driveshaft. For maintenance assistance, you can take this weed whacker to an authorized service center, browse the online manual or email Tanaka directly. Tanaka does not offer telephone support."]},"id":"d348e240-fd82-489f-93a6-8c97e66f356a","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Summary"},"id":"cb404928-31ce-4b5d-9aba-d968376e38a8","type":"heading"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["Tanaka really pulled out the stops to create a long-lasting, dependable unit with many desirable features.
