You can still read our original review below, but Top Ten Reviews is no longer updating this product’s information.</em>","The Techko S187D Safe <a href=\"/best-pool-alarms\">Pool Alarm</a> protects pools by alerting you if children and pets access the pool area. This pool gate alarm attaches to a door or a gate on a fence and sounds an alarm when the magnetic sensors are separated. It also features a second set of magnets for using on a secondary door or gate, such as a screen door.","The adult pass-through auto reset button allows adults to easily pass through without setting off the alarm. An additional pass-through button for delayed entry from either side of the door or fence allows you to set the alarm for children and pets to use the pool.","Because it is water and weather resistant, the alarm is safe for use in both indoor and outdoor pools. The always-on function ensures that you do not have to reset the alarm each time you need it, but it may be a hassle when using the pool frequently.","While the magnetic sensor is suitable for protecting doors, windows and gates, it cannot protect two entries or windows next to each other. Using an alarm on the door allows you to intervene before children or intruders actually get into the pool, and it can prevent accidents entirely. However, it does not alert you when something or someone falls into the pool, so you will need a separate pool alarm system if you want this function.","The loud 110-decibel alarm ensures that anyone within 100 yards knows that someone has accessed the pool; it is about the same volume as an average car horn. However, it does not feature a separate alarm for indoors, meaning that adults in large homes will have to keep watch with children playing around pools.","While the Techko pool alarm system requires a 9-volt battery to run, it does feature a low-battery indicator so that you can replace the battery before it dies.","With a loud alarm, easy pass-through options and effective failsafes for protecting children, the Techko S187D Safe Pool Alarm offers guaranteed alerts for parents who want to keep children out of the pool unsupervised. However, it offers no alerts when someone falls into the pool, and it does not easily turn off when a large number of people have access to the pool. On its own, it offers basic alerts when someone opens a door or gate going to the pool."]},"id":"fe743d7f-c7c1-4e35-a8cb-3abc8142e311","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"product_review_page_63617","url":"/techko-review","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"anna-burleson","url":"/author/anna-burleson","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","name":"Anna Burleson","dateModified":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","id":"4bFWMi8qjrUwQuwAFnJjZM","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2015-03-23T20:22:07Z","datePublished":"2015-03-23T20:22:07Z","name":"Techko S187D","synopsis":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","review":{"pros":[""],"cons":[""]},"strapline":"Editor’s Note: This product has been removed from our side-by-side comparison because it has been discontinued.","language":"en","dateModified":"2015-03-23T20:22:07Z","id":"uWwLbUcTW5WEejey3hrsoS","meta":{"title":"Techko S187D Pool Alarm Review","description":"The Techko S187D has a loud alarm, easy pass-through options and effective failsafes to prevent children from entering the pool unsupervised."},"products":[{"slug":"techko-s187d","url":"/product/techko-s187d","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:40Z","name":"Techko S187D","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:40Z","id":"V6tSZcbVQqmCAvhEesdoFc","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews"}],"dateImported":"2019-04-16T19:15:41Z","type":"review","template":"review","social":{"twitter":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/J7AMPCipLJqiQ56VU9mWgL.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:40Z","mimeType":"","name":"63589-techko-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63589-techko-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:40Z","id":"J7AMPCipLJqiQ56VU9mWgL","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J7AMPCipLJqiQ56VU9mWgL.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Techko S187D Pool Alarm Review","description":"The Techko S187D has a loud alarm, easy pass-through options and effective failsafes to prevent children from entering the pool unsupervised."},"facebook":{"image":{"status":"","height":0,"path":"/J7AMPCipLJqiQ56VU9mWgL.jpg","checksum":"","copyright":"","fileSize":0,"width":0,"caption":"","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:40Z","mimeType":"","name":"63589-techko-box.jpg","importSrc":"/i/rev/prod/ce/63589-techko-box.jpg","credit":"","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:40Z","id":"J7AMPCipLJqiQ56VU9mWgL","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","site":"toptenreviews","orientation":"","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J7AMPCipLJqiQ56VU9mWgL.jpg","alt":""},"title":"Techko S187D Pool Alarm Review","description":"The Techko S187D has a loud alarm, easy pass-through options and effective failsafes to prevent children from entering the pool unsupervised."}},"site":"toptenreviews","importUrl":"/electronics/family/best-pool-alarms/techko-review/","label":"","tags":[{"slug":"home-and-garden","url":"/home-and-garden","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:40Z","name":"Home & Garden","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:40Z","id":"RzYMxEcefnSZ6zN3xCh4Hm","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"},{"slug":"pool-and-hot-tub","url":"/home-and-garden/pool-and-hot-tub","dateCreated":"2019-04-16T19:15:40Z","name":"Pool & Hot Tub","dateModified":"2019-04-16T19:15:40Z","id":"Snsyvysc6JMsPB5BLBFHBh","dateImported":"2019-04-16T16:01:12Z","type":"category","site":"toptenreviews"}]}
