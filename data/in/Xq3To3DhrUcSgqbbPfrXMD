Tape 2 PC is a full-sized dual cassette recorder deck that has more capability than the other products we reviewed. Not only are you able to connect the deck to your computer via the included USB cable, but you also have the ability to connect other analog devices, such as an 8-track tape, vinyl record player or any device that has RCA ports, to capture and digitize audio. If you don&#39;t want a full tape deck, consider this product&#39;s little brother - <a href=\"/ion-tape-express-review\">Tape Express Plus</a>.","Another big difference between this device and other products on our lineup is how it draws its power. The smaller, more portable devices drew their power either from AA batteries, a USB connection to your computer or a DC adapter you can plug into the wall. In contrast, Tape 2 PC plugs directly into an AC socket. This gives it a much more consistent and stable power supply since it’s not dependent on your computer or batteries.","The software that comes with the Tape 2 PC deck is Ion’s EZ Vinyl/Tape Converter. This is great because this application is specifically designed to work with Ion hardware. Most of the other programs we reviewed come with a copy of Audacity, a free audio recording and editing application. While Audacity is a fine application, it’s not ideal for capturing and converting cassette tapes. In contrast, EZ Vinyl/Tape Converter was programmed to carry out that particular task. This, in part, accounts for the superior sound quality produced by this tape converter.","Once you’ve captured the audio on your cassettes into the converter software, it  asks you to input the metadata for each track. This information includes song titles, album and artist name. This is an important step because it is the metadata that allows media players like iTunes to identify the music you import.","If you have a large library of cassettes to convert, you may want to consider how much hard drive space the converted files will take up. The average song runs about three minutes. In our tests, a three-minute song yielded a file 3.5MB large. A digital download of the same song has a file size of 6.8MB. A smaller file size means you can fit more converted files onto your hard drive. In general, you can expect that 1GB of hard drive space holds about 280 songs."]},"id":"e1d0e840-c0af-4e51-8e6e-0d507ace77ab","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Ease of Use"},"id":"89d92bdc-9294-4128-b778-c2bb929d29a2","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/mQ7z7m2sFLiQAU2GQkafuA.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"One of the best aspects of the EZ Vinyl/Tape Converter application is that it walks you through the capturing and conversion process step by step. This takes all the guesswork out of converting your tapes. Other products that rely on Audacity require users to learn and use that application with no guidance. That’s a steep learning curve for people who have no audio-editing experience. EZ Vinyl/Tape Converter has no such curve; anyone can use this software right out of the box.","fullscreen":true,"importSrc":"http://www.toptenreviews.com/i/rev/scrn/small/52429-tape-2-pc4.jpg","src":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mQ7z7m2sFLiQAU2GQkafuA.jpg","credit":"","align":"","id":"mQ7z7m2sFLiQAU2GQkafuA","mos":"https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mQ7z7m2sFLiQAU2GQkafuA.jpg","alt":""},"id":"9a748a8d-d0d6-4d06-bfdd-171fc47bde82","type":"image"},{"data":{"paragraphs":["EZ Vinyl/Tape Converter has an automatic track-detection feature that detects the silence between tracks on an album, allowing it to separate each track automatically. However, there is one downside to this feature: The application cannot distinguish the silence that follows at the end of each song and silence that may occur during a song. If you have tracks on your tapes that have silent parts, you can turn off automatic track detection and capture those songs individually.","One minor flaw with this cassette converter is that it has no auto-reverse feature. Auto reverse means that when a tape comes to the end of one side, the player reverses the direction of the tape and plays the opposite side with no action required on the part of the user. This converter, though, requires you to flip the cassette manually when it reaches the end of one side."]},"id":"a77455da-0701-49cf-a8ca-46f025982683","type":"text"},{"data":{"text":"Audio Tools"},"id":"51363a7a-4f98-419c-be0b-299f9fcf9c0b","type":"heading"},{"data":{"path":"/Wnsut22rAdH3vVB5TLx6hb.jpg","link":{"href":"","rel":null,"target":""},"caption":"Tape 2 PC has a few tools that allow you to customize your conversion.
