Unlike speakers for stereo systems, computer speakers aren’t very large, which cuts down on costs quite a bit. You can find the best budget computer speakers for you for under $50 or even $100.","<strong>Speaker System Size</strong><br/>One of the first things you need to decide is what size of system you want. Computer speakers typically come in 2.0- and 2.1-channel models. The former include two satellite speakers that are responsible for both high-pitch sounds and bass. The former include two satellite speakers and a dedicated subwoofer. Because bass is handled by a separate unit, the subwoofer, 2.1-channel systems put out deeper low-range sounds, which makes them better for entertainment and gaming computers than 2.0 computer speakers.","<strong>Wired vs. Wireless</strong><br/>The next decision you need to make is if you want wired or wireless computer speakers. This, in large part, also determines how much you are going to spend. Wired systems typically connect to your desktop or laptop via a USB port, and because they are easier to make and don’t house as much advanced technology, they cost less than wireless systems. Wireless systems most often connect to your computer system via Bluetooth, and they tend to cost significantly more than wired systems. You can still easily find a good set of budget wireless PC speakers  –  just expect to pay closer to $100.","<strong>Price</strong><br/>If you’re looking for speakers but don’t want to spend a lot of money, you’re likely not interested in going beyond $50 t0 $100. This is definitely enough of a budget to find a good computer speaker system. You just have to know where to look, and after narrowing down the type of system you’re looking for, it’s not too difficult.","Under $50<br/>You’ll be hard-pressed to find the best wireless computer speaker systems for under $50, but finding a good quality set of wired computer speakers in this price range is easy. AmazonBasics and Logitech both make quality computer speakers that are well under $50 and can add a slick look to your desk or a shelf.","AmazonBasics makes a set of basic budget computer speakers that are just that – basic. The system connects to your computer using USB, and it weighs under 1.5 pounds. Logitech also has USB-connected systems. Both brands make 2.0-channel budget computer speakers, which means they don’t come with a subwoofer (although Logitech also makes 2.1 models). They don’t produce the absolute best sound, but they are still an improvement over your computer’s built-in speakers and are suitable for everyday use.","Under $100<br/>Beyond AmazonBasics and Logitech PC speakers, there are a handful of other brands you can consider in your search for the best budget computer speakers if you are planning on spending up to $100. These brands include Audioengine, Bose Companion, Grace Digital, Harman Kardon and Klipsch, all of which offer both wired and wireless systems. Additionally, many of these companies make 2.1-channel computer speaker systems that come with a subwoofer, so they sound better and have deeper bass output. Because of this, they can be used for entertainment and gaming PCs.","You don’t need a lot of money to get a quality set of computer speakers. Great units are available in both wired and wireless models and can generally be found for under $100."]},"id":"a59d4657-1e9d-4b78-8c9b-4b9047bb2df4","type":"text"}]],"body":null,"legacyId":"article_page_10098","url":"/best-budget-computer-speakers","authors":[{"email":"","slug":"kira-terry","url":"/author/kira-terry","dateCreated":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","name":"Kira Terry","dateModified":"2019-04-17T20:46:58Z","id":"Lg9uFDyvy5KKTDvpstGsja","dateImported":null,"site":"toptenreviews"}],"territories":["US","GB"],"companies":[],"dateCreated":"2016-09-26T19:28:10Z","datePublished":"2016-09-26T19:28:10Z","name":"Best Budget Computer Speakers","synopsis":"Choosing the Best Budget Computer Speakers for Your System\nYou don’t need to set aside a lot of money when you start looking for a good quality set of computer speakers.","review":{},"strapline":"Choosing the Best Budget Computer Speakers for Your System\nYou don’t need to set aside a lot of money when you start looking for a good quality set of computer speakers.","language":"en","dateModified":"2016-09-26T22:48:44Z","id":"su29YAnhmJNLW7V8doVYr4","meta":{"title":"Best Budget Computer Speakers","description":"Finding the best budget computer speakers doesn&rsquo;t have to be hard.
